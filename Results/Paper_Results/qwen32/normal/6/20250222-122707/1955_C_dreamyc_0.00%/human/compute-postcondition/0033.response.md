The provided code snippet appends the value of `b` to the deque `nums`. The values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` are not directly modified by this line of code unless `b` is modified in a previous part of the code which is not shown here. Since the task specifies the state before this line and does not indicate any modification to `b` before this line, we assume `b` retains its value.

Here is the output state after the code has been executed:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers including the newly appended `b`, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`. If `a` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x` and `b` is updated to `b - x`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `a` is not greater than 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1.**
