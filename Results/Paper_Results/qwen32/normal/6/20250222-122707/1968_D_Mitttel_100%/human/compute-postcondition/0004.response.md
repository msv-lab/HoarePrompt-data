To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` evaluates to `True`. 

Let's break down the condition:

1. **`not vis[s]`**: This means that the element at index `s` in the `vis` list should be `0` (since `vis` is initialized as a list of zeros). Since `s` is a list of 4 integers `[t, n, P_B, P_S]`, `vis[s]` is not directly valid because `s` is not a single index but a list. However, it's likely that `s` here refers to one of the indices `P_B` or `P_S` in the context of the game. For the loop to start, the position of either Bodya (`P_B`) or Sasha (`P_S`) should not have been visited yet. Therefore, `vis[P_B]` and `vis[P_S]` should be `0`.

2. **`k > 0`**: This means that the number of turns `k` should be greater than `0`.

Given this, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- Ensure that `vis[P_B]` and `vis[P_S]` are both `0` (which they are by default since `vis` is initialized as a list of zeros).
- Ensure that `k` is greater than `0`.

Since `vis` is already initialized as a list of zeros, we only need to ensure that `k` is greater than `0`. The initial value of `k` is not provided, but we can assume it needs to be set to a value greater than `0` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S] where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of n zeros. `k` must be greater than 0**
