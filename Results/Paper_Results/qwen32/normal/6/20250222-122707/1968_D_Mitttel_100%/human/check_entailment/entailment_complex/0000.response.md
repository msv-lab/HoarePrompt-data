### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. The program reads multiple test cases and, for each test case, calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. The key function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` with `k` turns remaining.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based for easier manipulation in Python.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calls `func_1` twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score possible starting from position `s` with `k` turns remaining.

4. **Determining the Winner**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on who has the higher score or if they are equal.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the game turns.
   - It keeps track of visited positions using the `vis` list to detect cycles.
   - It calculates the current score `cur` by adding the value of `a[s]` at each step.
   - It updates the maximum score `mx` by considering the scenario where the player stays in the current position for all remaining turns.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), the loop breaks and the function returns the maximum score `mx`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game dynamics accurately, including the possibility of cycles in the permutation. The function `func_1` efficiently calculates the maximum score by considering all possible moves and staying in the current position for the remaining turns.

The program also correctly handles the input and output requirements, processing each test case independently and producing the correct output for each one.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
