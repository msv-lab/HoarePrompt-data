Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mx` is `max(mx, a[s] * (2 + k))`, `cur` is `4 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been updated to be `4 * a[s]` by adding `a[s]` to its previous value of `2 * a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
