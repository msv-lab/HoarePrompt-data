The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, and `i` is 0. 

After executing the code, `u`, `v`, and `f` will hold the values read from the input. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0; `i` is 0; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**
