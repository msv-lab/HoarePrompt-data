The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state indicates that `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input, and these values will replace the previous values of `u`, `v`, and `f`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f`; `i` is 1; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**
