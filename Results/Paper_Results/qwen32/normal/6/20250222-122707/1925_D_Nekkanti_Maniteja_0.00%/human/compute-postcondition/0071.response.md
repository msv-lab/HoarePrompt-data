To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to break down the expression and understand the values of each component based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Constants and Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k` are given but their exact values are not provided.
   - `M` is explicitly given as 10.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over the `m` iterations.

2. **Formula for `s`:**
   - `s = c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The expression `s % M` will give the remainder when `s` is divided by `M` (which is 10).

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate `c`:**
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10.
   - This means that `c * (n * (n - 1) // 1) % 10 = 1`.

2. **Calculate `a`:**
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over the `m` iterations.
   - Without specific `f` values, `a` remains a sum that needs to be computed based on the input.

3. **Calculate `s`:**
   - `s = c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`
   - This formula involves arithmetic operations and the value of `s` will depend on the values of `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.

4. **Calculate `s % M`:**
   - Since `M` is 10, we need to find the remainder when `s` is divided by 10.
   - This can be computed as `(c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k) % 10`.

### Final Output

Given that the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values (hence `a`) are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and the operations performed.

Output: **s % 10 (where s is calculated as c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 1 modulo 10, a is the sum of all f values read from the input over m iterations, and M is 10)**
