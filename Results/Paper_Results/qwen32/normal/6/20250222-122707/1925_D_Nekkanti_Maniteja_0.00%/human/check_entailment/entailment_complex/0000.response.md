Let's analyze the given code and the problem statement to determine if the provided solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions. This involves understanding the probability of choosing a pair of friends and how their friendship values change over time.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code and see if it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends `(u, v)` and their initial friendship value `f`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It initializes `s` (sum) to 0 and `a` (total initial friendship value) to 0.
   - It sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs in `a`.
   - It then iterates `k` times, updating `s` based on the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The code prints the result `s % M` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:**
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is correct.
   - However, the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` inside the loop seems incorrect for computing the expected value.

2. **Incorrect Update of `s`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to update the sum `s` based on the expected value formula, but the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not match the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the increase in their friendship value over time.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
- This involves calculating the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the expected increase in their friendship values.
- The expected value formula should be derived based on the probability of choosing a pair and the sum of an arithmetic series for the friendship value increases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the expected value calculation based on the problem statement. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
