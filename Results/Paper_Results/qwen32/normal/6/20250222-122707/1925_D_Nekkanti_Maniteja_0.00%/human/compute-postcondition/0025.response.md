The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specified that `n` and `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` is initially set to 1000000007. The given code snippet will override the initial value of `k` with the value read from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `n` and `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third integer read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is computed as described above; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `m + k` (which is `m + 1000000007`); `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input, while the other variables retain their initial states or are computed based on these new values.
