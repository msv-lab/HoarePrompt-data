Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. For each of the m pairs of friends, the input specifies two distinct children a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) and their initial friendship value f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `n`, `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 1000000007.
- `M` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- `s` is computed as described above.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
- `i` is `m + k - 1` (which is `m + 1000000006`).
- `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.

The final output state in the required format:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a` remain the same; `s` is `s + c * a * k + c * c * m * (k-1) * k / 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged; `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`; `i` is `k`; `M` remains 10; `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over the `m` iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
