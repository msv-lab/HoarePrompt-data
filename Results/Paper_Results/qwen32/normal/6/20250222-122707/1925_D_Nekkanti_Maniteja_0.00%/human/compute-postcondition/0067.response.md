Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged; `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`; `i` is 2; `M` remains 10; `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over the `m` iterations; `k` must be greater than 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a` on top of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
