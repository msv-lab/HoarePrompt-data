The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. Therefore, the new value of `a` is `a + f`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f + f`; `i` is 1; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**
