Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 0, and the `i`th element of `num` is not equal to '0'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `num`, `counter`, and the condition about the elements of `num` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
