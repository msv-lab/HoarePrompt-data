#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in the list of integers for a test case. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: counter is 3.
    return counter
    #The program returns 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is expected to be a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. However, the function does not utilize these test cases in any meaningful way. Instead, it iterates over the elements of `num` from the end to the beginning, counting how many '0' strings it encounters consecutively before encountering a non-'0' value or reaching the start of the list. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the integer 3.
