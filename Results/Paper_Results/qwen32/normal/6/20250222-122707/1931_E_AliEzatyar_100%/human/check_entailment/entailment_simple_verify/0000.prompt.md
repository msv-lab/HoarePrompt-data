You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha

    Anna

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Anna's Moves**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of trailing zeros in each number (using `func_1`), but this does not correctly simulate Anna's move of reversing the digits of an element.
   - Reversing the digits of a number and removing leading zeros is not the same as counting trailing zeros. For example, reversing `1580` should result in `851`, not `158`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in all numbers, but this doesn't help in determining the final concatenated number formed by Sasha.
   - The total number of digits does not account for the effect of concatenation and the removal of leading zeros after reversing.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sasha's Moves**:
   - The program attempts to subtract the count of trailing zeros from the total number of digits, which is not a valid strategy for determining the final number formed by Sasha.
   - Sasha's move involves concatenating two numbers in any order, and this process should be simulated to determine the final number.

4. **Incorrect Condition for Winning**:
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not a correct way to determine if Sasha wins.
   - The final number formed by Sasha must be compared directly to \(10^m\), not derived from the difference between total digits and trailing zeros.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

- **Anna's Move**: Anna can reverse either `14` to `41` or `2` to `2`.
- **Sasha's Move**: If Anna reverses `14` to `41`, Sasha can concatenate `41` and `2` to form `412`, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Hence, Sasha wins.
- **Program's Output**: The program might incorrectly determine the winner based on the number of trailing zeros and total digits, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Simulate Anna's move by reversing the digits of each number.
- Simulate Sasha's move by concatenating two numbers in any order and checking if the resulting number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
- Use a strategy to determine the optimal moves for both players.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would involve more sophisticated logic to simulate the game and determine the winner based on optimal play.
