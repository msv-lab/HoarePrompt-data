Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers with values ranging from -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is 0. Either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**

In natural language: The value of `c` has been updated to `c + ele`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged. The precondition that either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, still holds.
