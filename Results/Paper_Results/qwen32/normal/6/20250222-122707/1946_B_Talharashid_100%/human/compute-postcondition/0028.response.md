The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is determined by `int(input())`. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The variables `c` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head, so they should not be adjusted here.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- The loop will execute again if `i_prev + 1` is less than the range limit, which is `int(input())`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset), `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset), `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
