The code snippet provided resets the variable `c` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, `maxi`, and `ele`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is a negative integer, and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
