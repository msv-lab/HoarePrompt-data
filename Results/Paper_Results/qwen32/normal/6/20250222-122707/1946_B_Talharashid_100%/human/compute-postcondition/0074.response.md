Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0 if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; otherwise, `c` is `c + ele`. `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
