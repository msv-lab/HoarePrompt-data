The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `c` is `0`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, `c` is 0.**
