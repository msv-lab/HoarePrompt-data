t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, an integer k such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and a list a of n integers where -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
