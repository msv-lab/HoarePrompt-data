Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset), and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is the cumulative sum after the last element is processed, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` is the input list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element was negative and `c` was reset), `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, `i` is incremented by the length of the list `l`, and `l` is the list of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
