Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is either 0 (if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`) or `c + ele` (otherwise), `maxi` is `max(c, maxi)` (only updated if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`), `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer.**
