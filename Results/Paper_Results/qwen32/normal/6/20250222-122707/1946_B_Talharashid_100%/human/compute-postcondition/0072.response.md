The code snippet `c += ele` updates the value of `c` by adding `ele` to it. The values of `n`, `k`, `maxi`, and `ele` remain unchanged. Since `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, the new value of `c` is `c + ele`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(c, maxi)` (only updated if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`), and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
