### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations. The key idea is to identify the maximum contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) within the array, as this subarray can be repeatedly summed and inserted into the array to maximize the total sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `l` itself.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: The program uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `l`. This is stored in the variable `maxi`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the final sum of the array after `k` operations. The formula used is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. 

   - `2 ** k * maxi` represents the sum of the maximum contiguous subarray if it were to be duplicated `k` times and added to the array.
   - `- maxi` is subtracted to correct for the initial addition of `maxi` in the formula, which is necessary because the initial sum of the array already includes `maxi`.
   - `sum(l)` is added to include the sum of the original array.
   - The result is taken modulo `1000000007` to handle large numbers.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l))` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(2 ** k - 1) * maxi + sum(l)`. This is because each operation can add `maxi` to the sum of the array, and `k` operations can add `maxi` up to `2 ** k - 1` times (not `2 ** k` times as the program currently calculates).

### Correctness:

Given the flaw in the formula, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
