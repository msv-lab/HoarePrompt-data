Postcondition: **`c` and `maxi` are updated based on the value of `ele`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0 if `ele_next` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele_next`; otherwise, `c` is `ele_next` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele_next` and 0. If `ele` is not negative or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is incremented by `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the maximum of `ele_next` and 0. `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.**
