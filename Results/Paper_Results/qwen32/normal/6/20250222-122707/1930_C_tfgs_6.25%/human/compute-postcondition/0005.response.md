The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `a` by `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` (which implies `i` is being incremented before this line, but for the purpose of this task, we'll consider `i` as it is given), and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. After executing the code, the value at `a[i]` will be updated, but the values of `i` and `n` remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`**.
