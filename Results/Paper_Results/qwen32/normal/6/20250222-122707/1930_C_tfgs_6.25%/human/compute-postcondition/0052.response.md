Initial State: - `a` remains unchanged.
- `counter` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will have `adv` elements appended, specifically `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `adv` remains unchanged.

Code to be executed:
```
cnt -= adv
```

Impact: The value of `cnt` is decreased by the value of `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` is reduced by `adv`. All other variables (`a`, `counter`, `ans`, `i`, `adv`) remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged; `counter` remains unchanged; `cnt` is reduced by `adv`; `ans` will have `adv` new elements appended, specifically `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`; `i` remains unchanged; `adv` remains unchanged.**
