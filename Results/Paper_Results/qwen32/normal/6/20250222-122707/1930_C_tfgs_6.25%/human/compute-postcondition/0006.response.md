The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (`i + 1`), making it `i + 2`.

Since the state of `a[i]` is not part of the loop head, we do not adjust it. The condition for the loop to continue is solely dependent on `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
