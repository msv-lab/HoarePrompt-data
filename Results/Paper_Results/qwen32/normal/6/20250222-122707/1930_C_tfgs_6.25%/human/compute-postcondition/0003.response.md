The code snippet provided is `a[i] += i + 1`. This means the value at index `i` in the list `a` is being incremented by `i + 1`.

Given the initial state does not specify the values of `a` or `i`, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`. All other parts of the state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 1`**. This indicates that the element at index `i` in the list `a` has been increased by `i + 1`.
