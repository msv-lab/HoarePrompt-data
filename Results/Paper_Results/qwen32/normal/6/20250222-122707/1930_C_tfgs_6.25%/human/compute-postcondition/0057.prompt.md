Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now a list with duplicate elements removed and sorted in descending order; `counter` is a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object with `counter[a[i]]` decremented by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list if `i` is not greater than 0, or contains `a[i]` if `i` is greater than 0, or if `i` is greater than 0, `a` is unchanged, `counter` has its element at index `a[i - 1]` decremented by `adv` and `counter[a[i]]` decremented by 1, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]]`, `i` and `adv` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object where `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list with the additional element `a[i]` appended, `i` is `i + 1`, `adv` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains unchanged; `i` and `adv` remain unchanged; `ans` has `a[i]` appended to it; `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1; `counter` and `cnt` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
