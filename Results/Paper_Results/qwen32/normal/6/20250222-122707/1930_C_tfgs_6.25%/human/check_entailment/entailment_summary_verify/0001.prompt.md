You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It modifies each element of the list by adding its 1-based index to it. Then, it constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique values of the modified list, based on the differences between consecutive elements and a count of duplicates. Finally, it prints the resulting list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
- We perform `n` operations where we choose an index `i` in `a`, insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then delete `a[i]` from `a`.
- The goal is to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from the set `S` after all operations, sorted in decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]` (where `i` is the index starting from 0 in the program, but the problem statement uses 1-based indexing).

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result array `ans` by iterating over the sorted unique elements.
   - For each element, it checks how many duplicates of the previous element can be inserted before the current element to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - It appends the current element to `ans` and decreases the count of that element in the `Counter`.
   - If there are remaining duplicates, it appends the largest possible values between consecutive elements in `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it.
- It handles duplicates by using a `Counter` and ensures that the final array `b` is sorted in decreasing order.
- The strategy of inserting the largest possible values between consecutive elements in `ans` is correct to maximize the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
