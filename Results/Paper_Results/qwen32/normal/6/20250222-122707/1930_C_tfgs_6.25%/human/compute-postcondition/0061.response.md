Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the same order, with additional elements inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count `cnt`, and an additional element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1. The new last element of `ans` is the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `a` and `counter` remains the same. The value of `cnt` is still `cnt - 1` and is greater than 0. The list `ans` has an additional element appended to it, which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.
