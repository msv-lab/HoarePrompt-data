The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variable `n`, which initially represents the length of the array, is not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is an input integer, and the list `a` is not yet defined. After the code is executed, `a` will be a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` derived from the input.**
