Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged. If `i` > 0, `counter` at key `a[i - 1]` is reduced by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, and `ans` will have `adv` new elements appended, specifically `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `counter`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `i` and `adv` remain unchanged.**
