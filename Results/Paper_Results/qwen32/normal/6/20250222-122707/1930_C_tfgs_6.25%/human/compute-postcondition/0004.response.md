The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is some value that is greater than `i_prev`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 1`, we do not need to modify `a[i]` or any other variables outside of the loop head. We only need to adjust `i` and ensure `n` is greater than the new `i`.

State: **`a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

However, to be more specific, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a[i_prev]` is `a[i_prev] + i_prev + 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`**

Since we do not have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it to:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
