Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It modifies each element of the list by adding its 1-based index to it. Then, it constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique values of the modified list, based on the differences between consecutive elements and a count of duplicates. Finally, it prints the resulting list.**
