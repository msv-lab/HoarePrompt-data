Output State: **`a` is a list with at least two elements where `a[i - 1]` is at least `a[i] + 2`, `counter` is a `Counter` object with `a[i - 1]` appearing at least once, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a` + 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `j` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The list `a` remains unchanged, and `counter` also remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` stays the same as it is derived from `n` and the length of `a`. The list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, because `j` was incremented by 1 before appending. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `adv` remains the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`.
