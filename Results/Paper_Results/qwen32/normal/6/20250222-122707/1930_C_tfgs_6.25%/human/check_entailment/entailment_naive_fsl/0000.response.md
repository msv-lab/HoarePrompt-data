Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S` exactly `n` times and then construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from `S`. The program uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates, but it does not ensure that the lexicographically largest possible `b` is constructed.

Let's analyze the issues with the code:

1. **Handling Duplicates**: The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value `a_i + i`. However, the logic for inserting elements into `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set `a` is flawed. It does not guarantee that the lexicographically largest possible array `b` is constructed.

2. **Constructing `b`**: The code attempts to construct `b` by appending elements from the sorted set `a` and filling in gaps based on the differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not always yield the lexicographically largest array `b`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5 4 3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Operation 1: Insert `1 + 3 = 4` into `S`. `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- Operation 2: Insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.
- Operation 3: Insert `3 + 1 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.

However, to maximize the lexicographical order, the operations should be:
- Operation 1: Insert `3 + 1 = 4` into `S`. `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- Operation 2: Insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.
- Operation 3: Insert `1 + 3 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.

But to maximize the order:
- Operation 1: Insert `3 + 1 = 4` into `S`. `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- Operation 2: Insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.
- Operation 3: Insert `1 + 3 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.

However, to maximize the order:
- Operation 1: Insert `3 + 1 = 4` into `S`. `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- Operation 2: Insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.
- Operation 3: Insert `1 + 3 = 4` into `S`. Since `4` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{4}`.

The correct way to maximize the lexicographical order is to always insert the largest possible value first, ensuring that the set `S` contains the largest possible values.

The provided code does not ensure this, and thus it does not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.
