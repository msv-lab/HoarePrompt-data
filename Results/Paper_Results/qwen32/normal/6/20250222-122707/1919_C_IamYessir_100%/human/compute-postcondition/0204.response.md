The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This changes the list `a` by adding one more element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty, in which case `x` would now be set to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]` after the append operation).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with the additional element `lit[i]`, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
