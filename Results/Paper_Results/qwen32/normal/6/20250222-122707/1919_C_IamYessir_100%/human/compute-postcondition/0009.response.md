The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp` remain unchanged except for the new variable `x` that is introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
