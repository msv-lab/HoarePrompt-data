Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` > `y`, the conditions for `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y` as described in the if part. If `x` ≤ `y`, the conditions for `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y` as described in the else part. Specifically, `x` and `y` are updated to reflect the last elements of `lit` and `b` respectively (or set to positive infinity if the respective lists are empty) based on the conditions.**
