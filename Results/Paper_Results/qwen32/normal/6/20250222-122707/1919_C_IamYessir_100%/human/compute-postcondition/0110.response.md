Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` plus 1. Otherwise, `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]` plus 1.**
