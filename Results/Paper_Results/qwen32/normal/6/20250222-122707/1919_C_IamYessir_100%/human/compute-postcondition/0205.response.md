The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now include one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) are not modified by this operation.

Since `b` has been modified, `y` will now be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `x` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`.**
