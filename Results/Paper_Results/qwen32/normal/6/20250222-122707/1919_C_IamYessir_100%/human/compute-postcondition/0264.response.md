Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended, depending on the conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty. If `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`.**
