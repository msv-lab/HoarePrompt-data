Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` remains unchanged; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` remains the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
