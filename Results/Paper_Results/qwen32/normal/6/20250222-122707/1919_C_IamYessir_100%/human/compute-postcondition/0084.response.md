The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value is `a`, as `lit[i]` is added to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` also remain unchanged unless the state of `a` or `b` directly affects them, which it does not in this case.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` was empty, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` before the append operation, `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`, and `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
