The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of the list `a`.**
