The code assigns the variable `x` the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is positive infinity.**
