Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0. If `x > y`, then `b` is updated based on the value of `lit[i]`: if `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` and `y` remains unchanged; if `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` and `x` remains unchanged; if `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `b` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x <= y`, then `a` and `y` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]`: if `x == y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `lit[i] >= x`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`; if `y >= lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` is not less than `y`, no changes are made to `a` or `y`. The conditions `x` and `y` are updated based on the above rules, and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b`.**
