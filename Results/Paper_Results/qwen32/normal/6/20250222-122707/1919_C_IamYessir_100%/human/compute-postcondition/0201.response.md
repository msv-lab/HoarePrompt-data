Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `y` ≥ `lit[i]`, `b` contains an additional element `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i]` > `x`. If `x` ≥ `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the condition `x ≥ lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` and `x` remain unchanged.**
