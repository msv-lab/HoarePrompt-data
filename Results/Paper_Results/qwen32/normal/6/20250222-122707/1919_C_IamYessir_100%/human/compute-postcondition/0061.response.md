The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` could be empty initially or contain some elements. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` now points to the next element in `lit` that needs to be appended to `a`.

If `a` was initially empty, after this line, `a` will contain one element, which is `lit[i]`. If `a` was not empty, `lit[i]` will be added to the end of `a`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` contains the element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` was empty before the operation, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit` before this operation, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
