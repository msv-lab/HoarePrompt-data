The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 (so if it was `i` before, now it is `i + 1`)**

To make it clear, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. So the state should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we need to be specific about the value of `i`, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`**

However, since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
