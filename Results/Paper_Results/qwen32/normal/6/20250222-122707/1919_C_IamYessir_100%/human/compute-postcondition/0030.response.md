The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Since `a` has a new element, the value of `x` (which is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty) will now be the newly appended element from `lit`.

Given that `x` and `y` were equal before this operation, and `x` is defined as the last element of `a`, after appending an element to `a`, `x` will be the newly appended element, and `y` will remain the same unless further changes are made to `b`. Since no changes are made to `b` in this snippet, `y` remains the same. Therefore, `x` and `y` are no longer necessarily equal after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it, `b` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `y` is unchanged.**
