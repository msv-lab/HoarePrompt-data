The code appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `a` was initially empty, `i` is -1, and `x` is `float('inf')`.
- If `a` was not initially empty, `i` is `len(b) - 1` and `x` is the last element of `a`.

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`:
- If `a` was initially empty, `a` now contains one element, which is `lit[-1]`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `lit[-1]`.
- If `a` was not initially empty, `a` now contains the previous elements plus `lit[i]`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.

The values of the other variables (`b`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `b` is a list (either empty or not); `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
