The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now have one more element, which is the element at index `i` from the list `lit`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` was an empty list before the append operation, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b` which is now `lit[i]`.**
