To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the variable `s`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `lit` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `cp` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b`.

### Key Variable:
- `s` is specifically defined as the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b`. This implies that `s` is a counter that increments each time `b[i] > b[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < \text{length of } b\).

### What is Printed:
The `print(s)` statement will output the value of `s`, which is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.

Since the exact contents of the list `b` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the value of `s` precisely based on the information given.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b`)**
