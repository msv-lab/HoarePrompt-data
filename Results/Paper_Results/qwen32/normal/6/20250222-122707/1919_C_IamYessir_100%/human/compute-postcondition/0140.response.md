The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the current element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This will change the list `b` by adding the new element at the end. The variable `s` which counts the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element might also change if the newly appended element `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of `b` (which was previously `y`).

Since `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` is greater than `y`, `lit[i]` is definitely greater than `y`. Therefore, `s` will be incremented by 1. Additionally, `y` will be updated to the value of `lit[i]` since `y` is always the last element of `b`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty) with the new element `lit[i]` appended, `cp` is 0, `s` is incremented by 1, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`.**
