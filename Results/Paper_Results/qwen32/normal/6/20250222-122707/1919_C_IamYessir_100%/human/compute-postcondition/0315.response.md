The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This will change the list `b` by adding one more element to it. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on the new state of `b`.

- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; this state remains unchanged.
- `b` is now a list that has `lit[i]` appended to it.
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; this state remains unchanged because the code snippet does not provide any mechanism to update `s`.
- `i` is `i + 1`; this state remains unchanged.
- `n` is greater than `i`; this state remains unchanged.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; this state remains unchanged.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions, and now has `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**
