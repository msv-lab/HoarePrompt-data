Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0. If `a[i] > a[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 3; otherwise, `s` remains 2.**
