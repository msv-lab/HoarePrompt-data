The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lit`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` retains its input integer value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
