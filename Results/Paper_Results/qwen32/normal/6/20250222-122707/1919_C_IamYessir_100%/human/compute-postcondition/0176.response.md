Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that may or may not have the `i`-th element of `lit` appended, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` was originally greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` was greater than `y`, then `a` has the `i`-th element of `lit` appended, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
