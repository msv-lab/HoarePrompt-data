The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` by adding one more element to it. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, which means it has already been incremented before this line of code is executed, so `i` remains the same here. The value of `n` being greater than `i` still holds true. The variables `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since `b` now has an additional element, `y` will be updated to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**
