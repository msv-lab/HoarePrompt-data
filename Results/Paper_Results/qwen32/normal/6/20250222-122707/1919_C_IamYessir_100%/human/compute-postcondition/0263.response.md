Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it if `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element. `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`. `n` is greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` at the end; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.**
