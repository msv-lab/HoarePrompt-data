Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `y` ≥ `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If neither condition is met, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their previous values.**
