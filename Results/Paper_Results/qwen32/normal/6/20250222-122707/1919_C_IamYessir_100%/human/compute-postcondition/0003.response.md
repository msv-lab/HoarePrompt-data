The code snippet initializes two empty lists, `a` and `b`. No changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, or `lit`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `lit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list.**
