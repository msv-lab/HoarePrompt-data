The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` modifies the list `a` by appending the element `lit[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

- `t` is still an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `lit` is still a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is no longer an empty list (if it was) or now contains one more element (if it was not empty).
- `b` is still a list (either empty or not empty).
- `cp` is still 0.
- `s` is still the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `x` is still either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list or the last element of `a` before the append operation if `a` was not empty. However, after the append operation, `x` is now equal to `lit[i]`.
- `y` is still `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty.
- The condition `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` still holds, but now `x` is specifically equal to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `lit[i]`, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty.**
