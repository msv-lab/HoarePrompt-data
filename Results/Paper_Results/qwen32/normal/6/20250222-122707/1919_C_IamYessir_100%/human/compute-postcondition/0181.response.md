The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now include one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the conditionals or modifications that follow this statement. Since the code does not modify `x` or `y` directly, their values depend on the state of `a` and `b` after this operation. However, since `a` is modified, `x` will now be the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), assuming `a` was not empty before this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `lit[i]` (since `a` is not empty), `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
