The only variables in the loop head of the provided `for` loop are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions
- `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions
- `x` and `y` are updated based on the conditions

Since only `i` and `n` can be adjusted in the loop head, we need to increment `i` by 1 to move to the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of iterations.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.

If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 3 at the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration since they are not part of the loop head.

Example Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `x` and `y` are updated based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1**
