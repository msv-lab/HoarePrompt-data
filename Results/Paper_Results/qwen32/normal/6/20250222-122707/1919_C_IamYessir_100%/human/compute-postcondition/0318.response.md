Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` if `lit[i]` was not greater than `x`, or `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` was greater than `x`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block has executed, considering both the if and else parts. It captures the changes to `b`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y` based on the condition `lit[i] > x`.
