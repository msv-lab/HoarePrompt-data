Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x < y`, then if `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes the new element `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of the list `a`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes the new element `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, `y`, or `b`.**
