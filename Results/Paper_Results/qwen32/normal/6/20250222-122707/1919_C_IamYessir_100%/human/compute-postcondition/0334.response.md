The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is 1, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`.**
