Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
