The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This changes the list `a` by adding a new element to it, but the other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The condition `x < y` and the relationship between `x` and `y` are still valid as the code does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list with the `i`-th element of `lit` appended to it, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`.**
