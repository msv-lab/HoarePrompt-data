The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This operation modifies the list `a` by adding a new element to it. No other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `a` may or may not be empty, and `lit` is a list of integers. After executing the code, the list `a` will have one additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` was empty before the operation, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` before the operation, `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`, and `a` now contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`.**
