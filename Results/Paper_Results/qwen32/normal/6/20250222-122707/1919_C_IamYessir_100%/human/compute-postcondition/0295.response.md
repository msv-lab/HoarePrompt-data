Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
