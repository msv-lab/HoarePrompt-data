The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the current element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This action modifies the list `a` by adding `lit[i]` as its new last element. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` at the end, If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `x >= lit[i] > y`.**
