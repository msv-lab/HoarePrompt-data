Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is a list that includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `cp` is 0, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty, and `x` is less than `y`.**
