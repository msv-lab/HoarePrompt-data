Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is 2 if the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1, `i` is 2**

This means that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so if `s` was 1 (meaning `a[i]` was greater than `a[i - 1]`), it is now 2. If `s` was 0, it would now be 1. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
