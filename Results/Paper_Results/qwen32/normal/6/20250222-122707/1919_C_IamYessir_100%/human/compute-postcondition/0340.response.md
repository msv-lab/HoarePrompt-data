The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `s` was originally 1, it becomes 2, and if `s` was originally 2, it becomes 3. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0.**
