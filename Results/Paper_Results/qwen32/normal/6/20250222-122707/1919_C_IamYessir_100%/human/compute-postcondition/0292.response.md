The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` and potentially the variable `y` if `b` was previously empty or not.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that has `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b`.**

In simple terms: The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end. If `b` was previously empty, `y` is now `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
