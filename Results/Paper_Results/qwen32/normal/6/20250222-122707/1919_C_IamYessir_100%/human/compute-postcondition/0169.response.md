Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `y` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.**
