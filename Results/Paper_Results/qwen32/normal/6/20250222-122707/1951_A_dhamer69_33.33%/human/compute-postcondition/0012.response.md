Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The current value of `count_1` is odd.**
