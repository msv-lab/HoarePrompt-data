The code snippet `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1 (since it was at least 2 initially and is decremented by 1); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even) and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11". `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`.**
