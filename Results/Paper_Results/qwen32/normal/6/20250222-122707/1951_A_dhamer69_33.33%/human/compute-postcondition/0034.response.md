Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 2; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is the string '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even). If `count_1` is even, the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11". `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`.**
