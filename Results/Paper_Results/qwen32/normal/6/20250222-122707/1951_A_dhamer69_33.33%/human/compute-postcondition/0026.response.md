The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It directly outputs 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.
3. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are defined with certain conditions, but they do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
