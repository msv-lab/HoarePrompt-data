The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are provided as preconditions, and `s` is the input string from the user.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.**
