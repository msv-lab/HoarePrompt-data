The code `a.add(i)` adds the current character `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` is a set, it will only contain unique elements. The string `s` and the character `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` contains all its previous elements plus the element `i`, with duplicates removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed.**
