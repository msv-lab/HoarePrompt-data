Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1.
- `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed (though `i` is not used in the provided print statement).
- `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s` and is different from `s`.
- `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
```

This statement is concatenating two parts of the string `s`:
1. `s[len(s) // 2:]` - This is the second half of the string `s`.
2. `s[:len(s) // 2]` - This is the first half of the string `s`.

### Concatenation Explanation:
- `len(s) // 2` gives the middle index of the string `s`. 
- `s[len(s) // 2:]` takes all characters from the middle index to the end of the string.
- `s[:len(s) // 2]` takes all characters from the start of the string to the middle index.

When these two parts are concatenated, the result is the string `s` with its second half moved to the front. This is exactly how `newstr` is defined in the initial state.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the string `newstr`, which is the string `s` with its second half moved to the front.

Output: **newstr (where newstr is the string formed by concatenating the second half of s with the first half of s)**
