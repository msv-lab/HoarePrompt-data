The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty set, after executing the code, `a` will contain the single element `i`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing the element `i`.**
