Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is `input_string.strip(' ')`: This means `s` is the `input_string` with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `a` is a set of all unique characters in `input_string.strip(' ')` with more than one element: This means `a` contains characters that appear more than once in the stripped `input_string`.
- `i` is the last character of `input_string.strip(' ')`: This means `i` is the final character of the stripped `input_string`.
- `t` remains unchanged: The variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value does not affect the output.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string 'YES'. None of the variables `s`, `a`, `i`, or `t` are used in this print statement, so their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
