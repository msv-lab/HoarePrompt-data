The code snippet initializes a new set `a` without modifying the existing variables `t` and `s`. Therefore, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `s` remains the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed. The new set `a` is empty.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is an empty set.**
