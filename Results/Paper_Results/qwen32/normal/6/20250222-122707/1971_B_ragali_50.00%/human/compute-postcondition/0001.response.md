To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

However, since the problem specifies that we must adhere to the text format and only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we ensure that `t` is adjusted to be within the specified range if it's not already. Given the constraints, `t` is already guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 1000, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts** 

Since `i` is not a state that needs to be set before the loop starts (it is set by the `range` function), we can simply confirm that `t` meets the required condition.

Final State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
