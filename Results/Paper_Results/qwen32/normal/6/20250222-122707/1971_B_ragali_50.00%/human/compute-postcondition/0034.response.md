The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string with leading and trailing spaces removed, and `i` is the next character to be processed, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` contains all its previous elements plus the element `i`, with duplicates removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed.**

Since `i` is the loop variable and will be updated by the loop itself, we only need to ensure that `s` remains unchanged and `i` reflects the next character in `s` for the next iteration. The state of `a` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed.** 

However, to be precise about the state of `i` at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` contains all its previous elements plus the element `i`, with duplicates removed; `i` is the current character in the string `s` that has just been processed, and the next iteration will process the subsequent character.** 

Since `i` is updated automatically by the loop, we can simplify this to:

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed.**
