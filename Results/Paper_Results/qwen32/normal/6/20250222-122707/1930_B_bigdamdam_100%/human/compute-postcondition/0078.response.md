Output State: **For each test case, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1)` and the odd indices are filled with values `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., n-1 + n % 2`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, for each test case, the list `p` is filled such that:
- The even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with decreasing even numbers starting from `n` down to `n - 2 * (floor(n/2) - 1)`.
- The odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with increasing odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2` up to `n-1 + n % 2`.

The variable `ind` is not relevant to the final output list `p` and can be disregarded for the final state description. The variable `i` is used as a loop index and does not persist after the loop completes. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop and is used only to determine the size and values to be placed in `p`.
