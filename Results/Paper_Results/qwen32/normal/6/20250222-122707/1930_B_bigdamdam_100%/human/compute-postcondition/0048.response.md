Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value at index `i` of the list `p` is updated to `ind`. Here are the specifics:

- `p` is a list where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-2), ind, 0, ..., 0` with the element at index `1` replaced by `ind`.
- `ind` is `5 + n % 2`.
- `i` is `3`.
- `n` must be greater than `3`.

The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the value at index `3` of the list `p` to `ind`.

To summarize:
- `ind` is `5 + n % 2`.
- `i` is `3`.
- `p[3]` is updated to `ind`.

The output state remains the same as the initial state except for the updated value at `p[3]`.

Output State: **`p` is a list where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-2), ind, 0, ..., 0` with the element at index `1` replaced by `ind` and the element at index `3` also replaced by `ind`; `ind` is `5 + n % 2`; `i` is `3`; `n` must be greater than `3`.**
