The `while` loop in the provided code snippet continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` right-shifted by 1.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `i` is 2.
- `arr` is a list containing the elements 0 and 1 if `k & 1` equals 1, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the element 1.
- `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted.
- `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be a non-zero value. The other variables do not affect the condition for the `while` loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` must be a non-zero integer; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is 2; `arr` is a list containing the elements 0 and 1 if `k & 1` equals 1, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the element 1; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**
