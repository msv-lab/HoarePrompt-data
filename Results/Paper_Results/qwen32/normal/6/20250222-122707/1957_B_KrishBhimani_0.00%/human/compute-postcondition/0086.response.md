The given code snippet appends the result of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the changes to the variables:

- `ans` will have a new element added to it, which is `k0 - sum(ans)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

The output state reflects the updated `ans` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element, `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i` and potentially `k0 - (1 << i)` if `c` was equal to `n - 1` in the previous iteration, and `ans` now includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`**.
