The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `k`, effectively dividing `k` by 2 and discarding the remainder. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is `k`.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is `[0]` if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains `[]`.
- `c` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.

After executing `k = k >> 1`, the value of `k` is now `k // 2` (integer division by 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is `k // 2`; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is `[0]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains `[]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
