To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables evolve over time. The loop processes the binary representation of `k` and appends indices to `arr` where the corresponding bit in `k` is `1`. The loop continues until `k` becomes `0`.

Let's summarize the loop's behavior and the variables' states:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `arr` starts as an empty list.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` (let's call it `k_initial`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - In each iteration, the loop checks if the least significant bit of `k` is `1` (`k & 1 == 1`). If true, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - `k` is then right-shifted by 1 (`k = k >> 1`), effectively removing the least significant bit.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `k` becomes `0`.

4. **Post-Loop:**
   - `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to `1` in the binary representation of `k_initial`.
   - `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted.
   - `ans` is constructed as a list of `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the final state by understanding the full binary representation of `k_initial` and how it affects `arr` and `ans`.

### Final Output State
After all iterations, `k` will be `0`, and `i` will be equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`. The `arr` list will contain the indices of all bits that were `1` in `k_initial`. The `ans` list will be constructed based on these indices.

Let's denote the binary representation of `k_initial` as `b_m b_{m-1} ... b_1 b_0`, where `b_i` is the i-th bit. The loop will append `i` to `arr` for each `b_i` that is `1`.

### Example
If `k_initial` is 13 (binary `1101`), the loop will:
- Append `0` (for the least significant bit `1`).
- Append `2` (for the third bit `1`).
- Append `3` (for the most significant bit `1`).

Thus, `arr` will be `[0, 2, 3]`.

The `ans` list will be:
- `1 << 0` = 1
- `1 << 2` = 4
- `1 << 3` = 8

Sum of `ans` is `1 + 4 + 8 = 13`. Since `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans) = k0 - 13`. The list `ans` will be extended with zeros if its length is less than `n`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`; `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the loop processes the binary representation of `k`, constructs `arr` with the indices of set bits, and builds `ans` by calculating powers of 2 for these indices, adjusting the last element to ensure the sum equals `k0`, and padding with zeros if necessary.
