The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is initially 0, after the execution of this line, `arr` will contain one element: `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1` with the current value of `k` being odd; `k0` is `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is `[0]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`**.
