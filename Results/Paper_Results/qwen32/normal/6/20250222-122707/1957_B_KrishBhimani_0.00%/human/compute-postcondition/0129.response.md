Postcondition: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 1; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one more additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before this new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.**
