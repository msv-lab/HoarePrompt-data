The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` bits to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `c`, `n`, `k0`, or the condition `c == n - 1`. The only change is that `ans` gains a new element.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `c` is incremented by 1; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.**
