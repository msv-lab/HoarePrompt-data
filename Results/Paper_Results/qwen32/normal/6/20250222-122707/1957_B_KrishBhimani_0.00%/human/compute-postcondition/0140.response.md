Let's break down the given initial state and understand the behavior of the code snippet:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `ans` is a list that is constructed based on the elements of another list `arr`.
   - For each element in `arr`, `1 << i` (which is equivalent to \(2^i\)) is appended to `ans` until a counter `c` reaches `n - 1`.
   - Once `c` reaches `n - 1`, `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, `ans` is padded with zeros until its length is `n`.

2. **Understanding the Construction of `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts as an empty list.
   - For each element in `arr`, `1 << i` is calculated and appended to `ans`. Here, `i` is the index of the element in `arr`.
   - This process continues until `c` (which presumably counts the number of elements processed) reaches `n - 1`.
   - At this point, `k0 - sum(ans)` is calculated and appended to `ans`.
   - If `ans` is not already of length `n`, it is padded with zeros to reach the length `n`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The output of `print(*ans)` will be the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
   - Given the construction process, the first `len(arr)` elements of `ans` will be \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{\text{len(arr)}-1}\).
   - The next element will be `k0 - sum(ans[:len(arr)])` if `len(arr) < n`.
   - The remaining elements (if any) will be zeros to ensure `ans` has a length of `n`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `k0`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the structure and contents of `ans` based on the given information.

**Final Answer:**
Output: **2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(len(arr)-1), k0 - sum(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(len(arr)-1)), 0, 0, ..., 0 (where the number of zeros is such that the total length of ans is n)**
