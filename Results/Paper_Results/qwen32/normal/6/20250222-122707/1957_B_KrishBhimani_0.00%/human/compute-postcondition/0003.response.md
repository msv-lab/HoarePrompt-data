The code provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. No other variables are affected or modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list**.
