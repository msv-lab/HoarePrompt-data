Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is greater than 1; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is 1; `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` is `[1]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`**

In natural language, the value of `arr` is updated to include `1`. If `k0` was odd, `arr` now contains `[0, 1]`; if `k0` was even, `arr` now contains `[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
