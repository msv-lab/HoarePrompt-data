The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`). The output state will reflect the initialization of `ans` as an empty list while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`; `arr` is a list of indices of the bits that are set in the binary representation of the original value of `k`; `ans` is an empty list.**
