The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` took the value of the last element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have another element, and `i` should take the value of that next element.

State: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 1; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.**
