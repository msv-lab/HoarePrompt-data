Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
