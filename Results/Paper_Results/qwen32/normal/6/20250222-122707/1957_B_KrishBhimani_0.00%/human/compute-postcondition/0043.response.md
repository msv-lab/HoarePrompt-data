The code snippet provided appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. This means that `ans` will now include an additional element which is `2` raised to the power of `i`.

Here are the variables and their states after the execution of the provided code:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is still a list of substrings from the input string.
- `n` is still the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is still 0.
- `k0` is still 0.
- `i` is still the next element in `arr` after the current `i`.
- `arr` is still a list with at least one element.
- `c` retains its original value + 1.
- `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `c` retains its original value + 1; `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`.**
