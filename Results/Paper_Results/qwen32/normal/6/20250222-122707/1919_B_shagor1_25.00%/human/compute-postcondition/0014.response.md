To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the expression `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State:
- `neg` is the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it's a variable that is known in the context of the code (likely the length of the string `s` or some other integer related to `s`).

### Analysis:
1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression is a conditional (ternary) expression in Python: `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`
   - This means:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n`.

2. **Possible Values**:
   - Since `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`, `neg` is always a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is not specified, but it could be the length of the string `s` or some other integer.

### Output Determination:
- **Case 1: `n != neg`**
  - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
  - For example, if `s = "----abc"`, then `neg = 4` and if `n = 7` (the length of `s`), the output will be `7 - 2 * 4 = -1`.
  
- **Case 2: `n == neg`**
  - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.
  - For example, if `s = "----"`, then `neg = 4` and if `n = 4`, the output will be `4`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to neg, otherwise n (where n is an integer and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s)**
