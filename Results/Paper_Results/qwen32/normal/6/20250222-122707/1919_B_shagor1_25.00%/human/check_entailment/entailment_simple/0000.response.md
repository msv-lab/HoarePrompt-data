### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the minimum penalty for splitting an array derived from a string `s` consisting of `+` and `-` into subarrays. Each subarray's penalty is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find an optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then counts the number of `-` characters in `s` and calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise `n`.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Understanding the Penalty Calculation:**
   - The array `a` is derived from `s` by converting `+` to `1` and `-` to `-1`.
   - The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * length(subarray)`.
   - The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to create subarrays where the sum is zero, as `|0| * length(subarray) = 0`.

2. **Analyzing the Formula:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` seems to be derived from the idea that each pair of `+` and `-` can form a zero-sum subarray, contributing `0` to the penalty.
   - If `n == neg`, it means there are only `-` characters, and the entire array cannot be split into zero-sum subarrays. Therefore, the penalty is simply `n`.
   - If `n != neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` suggests that we can form `neg` zero-sum subarrays by pairing `-` with `+`, and the remaining elements (if any) will contribute to the penalty.

3. **Verification with Sample Inputs:**
   - **First Test Case:** `s = "+"`
     - `n = 1`, `neg = 0`
     - Penalty = `1 - 2 * 0 = 1` (Correct)
   - **Second Test Case:** `s = "-----"`
     - `n = 5`, `neg = 5`
     - Penalty = `5` (Correct)
   - **Third Test Case:** `s = "+-+-+-"`
     - `n = 6`, `neg = 3`
     - Penalty = `6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (Correct)
   - **Fourth Test Case:** `s = "--+++++++-"` 
     - `n = 10`, `neg = 2`
     - Penalty = `10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (Incorrect, Correct Answer is 4)
   - **Fifth Test Case:** `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"` 
     - `n = 20`, `neg = 7`
     - Penalty = `20 - 2 * 7 = 6` (Incorrect, Correct Answer is 4)

The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not correctly account for all possible optimal splits, especially when there are leftover `+` or `-` characters that cannot be paired to form zero-sum subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
