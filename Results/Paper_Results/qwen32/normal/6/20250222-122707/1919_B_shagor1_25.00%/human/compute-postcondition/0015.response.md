Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, followed by the string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters '+' and '-'. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.**
