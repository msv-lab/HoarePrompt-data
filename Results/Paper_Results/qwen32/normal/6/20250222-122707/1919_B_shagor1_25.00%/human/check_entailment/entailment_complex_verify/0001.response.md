### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies issues with the provided code and explains why the formula `n - 2 * neg` is incorrect for calculating the minimum penalty.

Let's break down the logic further to validate the original assessment:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to split the string `s` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subarrays where the sum is zero, as this results in a penalty of zero.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy involves balancing the number of `+` and `-` in each subarray.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` are equal, the penalty is zero.
   - If they are not equal, the remaining characters form a subarray with a non-zero sum, and the penalty is the length of this subarray.

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - Let `plus` be the number of `+` in the string.
   - Let `neg` be the number of `-` in the string.
   - The minimum penalty is `abs(plus - neg)`, as this represents the length of the remaining subarray after balancing `+` and `-`.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code:**
   - The code counts the number of `-` in the string.
   - It calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`, otherwise `n`.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is incorrect because it does not correctly represent the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-`.
   - The condition `if n != neg` is unnecessary and incorrect. The penalty should always be the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The correct formula should be `abs(plus - neg)`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
