The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the length of the string `s` in the subsequent input. The string `s` and the total number of test cases `t` remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 1000. `n` is an input integer.**
