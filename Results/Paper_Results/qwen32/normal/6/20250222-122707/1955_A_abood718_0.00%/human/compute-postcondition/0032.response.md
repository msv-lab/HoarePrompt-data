Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It performs some computation based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `b` is greater than `a`, it returns `n` multiplied by `b` minus `a`; otherwise, it returns `n` multiplied by `a` minus `b`.**
