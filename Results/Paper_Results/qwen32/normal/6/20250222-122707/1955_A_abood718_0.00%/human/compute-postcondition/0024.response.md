The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `A`, `B`, and `C`), but the `print` statement only involves the variables `A` and `B`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not relevant to the output of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

Based on the initial state, `A` and `B` are integers that are read from the input. The exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided, but we know they are integers within the range 1 to 30.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical result of `A * B`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
