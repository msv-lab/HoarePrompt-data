To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(A * B)`, let's break down the information provided in the initial state.

1. **Variables and Their Ranges:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
   - The input value for the range is 1, which suggests that there is only one test case.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are three integers read from the input.
   - The condition `B * 2 < C` is given, but it does not directly affect the calculation of `A * B`.

2. **The Specific Calculation:**
   - The `print(A * B)` statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

3. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the product of `A` and `B`.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the output can be precisely described as the product of the two integers `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
