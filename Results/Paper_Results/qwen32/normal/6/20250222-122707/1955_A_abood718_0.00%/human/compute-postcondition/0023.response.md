The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. No other operations are performed on the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, so their states remain unchanged. The conditions and operations involving `A`, `B`, and `C` are not executed in this snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.**
