Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- The input value for the range is 1.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- `A` is an even integer.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement calculates the value of \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \) and converts it to an integer using `int()`.
- Given that `A` is an even integer, \(A \times C\) will always be an even integer because the product of an even number and any integer is even.
- Dividing an even integer by 2 will always result in an integer, so the `int()` function does not change the value in this case.

### Output:
The print statement outputs the integer value of \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \).

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `C`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A is an even integer and C is an integer such that B * 2 >= C)**
