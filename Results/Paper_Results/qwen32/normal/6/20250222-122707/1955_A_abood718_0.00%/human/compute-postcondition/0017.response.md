The value of `X` is assigned the result of the integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `B`, `C` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input, `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.**
