To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.
- `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, i.e., `X = A // 2`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Calculation:
1. **Determine `X`**: Since `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, `X = A // 2`.
2. **Calculate the Expression**: The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`. Substituting `X` with `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`. Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are the integers read from the input)**
