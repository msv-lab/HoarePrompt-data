Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input, `X` is `A // 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `X` is now the integer division of `A` by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged.
