Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. These variables are also not used in the provided code snippet.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2` (integer division of `A` by 2).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Explanation:
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- The expression `X * C + B` computes the value as `(A // 2) * C + B`.
- Since the specific values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
