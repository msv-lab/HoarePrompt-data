Output State: **`bets` is an input integer such that `bets` >= 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a new list of integers with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[i])`, `i` is `bets - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sumo` has been updated to be the integer value of the `i`-th element of the list `a`, where `i` is `bets - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
