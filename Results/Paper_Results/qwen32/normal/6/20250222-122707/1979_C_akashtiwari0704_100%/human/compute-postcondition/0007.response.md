The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range derived from `len(l)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was incremented by 1.
- `g` was recalculated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`. Since `i` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still within the bounds of the list `l`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous state. The length of the list `l` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the new value, which is the previous `i` plus 1.
- `len(l)` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` (recalculated), `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**
