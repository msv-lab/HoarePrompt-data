Postcondition: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`**
