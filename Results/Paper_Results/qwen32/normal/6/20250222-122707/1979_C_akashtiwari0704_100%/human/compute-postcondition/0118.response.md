Postcondition: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then no further action is taken. Otherwise, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and so on until the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space.**
