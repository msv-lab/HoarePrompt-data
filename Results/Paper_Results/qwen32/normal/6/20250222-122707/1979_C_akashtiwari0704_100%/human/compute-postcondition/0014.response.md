The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `bets`, `t`, `T`, and `g` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
