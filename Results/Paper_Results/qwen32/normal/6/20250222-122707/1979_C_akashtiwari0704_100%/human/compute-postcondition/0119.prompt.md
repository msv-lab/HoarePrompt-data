Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program continues to execute without further changes. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: bets is an input integer, t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, T is 1, g is the least common multiple of all elements in the list l, l is a list with at least one element, a is a list where each element is updated to prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of all elements in the list a, sumo is the sum of all updated elements in a, i is bets - 1. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, the program does not specify an action (it could terminate or continue to the next statement). Otherwise, ans is a string containing the string representations of the first bets elements of the list a, each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then no further action is taken. Otherwise, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and so on until the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
