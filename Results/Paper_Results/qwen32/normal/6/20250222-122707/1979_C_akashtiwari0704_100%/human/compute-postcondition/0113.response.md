The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is initially 0, it appends `str(a[0]) + ' '` to `ans`.

Output State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `i` is 0, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state means that `bets` remains a positive integer, `i` remains 0, and `ans` now includes the string representation of the first element of the list `a` followed by a space.
