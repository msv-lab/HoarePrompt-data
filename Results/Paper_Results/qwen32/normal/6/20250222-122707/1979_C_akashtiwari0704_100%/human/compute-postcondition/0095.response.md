The code snippet sets `sumo` to 0. This means the value of `sumo` is reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is 0, `i` is `bets - 1`.**
