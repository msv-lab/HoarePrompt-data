To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `T` is 0 and remains unchanged.
- `g` starts at 1 and gets updated in each iteration.
- `l` is a list with elements that the loop iterates over.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. In each iteration, `g` is updated by multiplying it with the current element `l[i]` and then dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. This operation effectively updates `g` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements of `l` encountered so far.

After all iterations, `g` will be the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, `g` will be the least common multiple of all the numbers in the list `l`, `t` remains the same as the input integer, and `T` remains 0.
