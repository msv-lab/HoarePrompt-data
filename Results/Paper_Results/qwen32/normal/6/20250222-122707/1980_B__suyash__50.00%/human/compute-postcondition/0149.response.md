To determine what will be printed when the `print('MAYBE')` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `i` is `len(l)`, where `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order.
   - `t` is greater than `len(l)`.
   - `a` is the value of the new `input()`, which is a string of space-separated values.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers.
   - `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 substring.
   - `n` is the first element of `b`.
   - `f` is the second element of `b`.
   - `dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`.
   - `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order.
   - `k` is the third element of `b` minus the count of `l[i]` in `dic`.
   - `fav` is `o[f - 1]`.
   - Additionally, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.
   - The current value of `k` is less than 0.

2. **Interpretation of the Conditions:**
   - Since `i` is `len(l)`, `l[i]` is out of bounds for the list `l` because list indices start from 0 and go up to `len(l) - 1`. This suggests that `i` is not a valid index for `l`.
   - The condition that `fav` is both `o[f - 1]` and `l[i]` is problematic because `l[i]` is out of bounds. This indicates that there might be an inconsistency or a specific edge case being handled in the code.
   - The value of `k` being less than 0 is provided as additional context, but it doesn't directly influence what gets printed by the `print('MAYBE')` statement.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print('MAYBE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables. It simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **MAYBE**
