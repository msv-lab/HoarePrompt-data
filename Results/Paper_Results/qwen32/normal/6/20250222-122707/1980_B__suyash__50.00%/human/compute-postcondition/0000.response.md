The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, the execution of the code snippet does not change the value of `t` but rather reassigns it based on the new input. However, the precondition for `t` remains valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
