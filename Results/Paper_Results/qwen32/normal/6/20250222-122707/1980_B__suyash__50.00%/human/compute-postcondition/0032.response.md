Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers; `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace and sorted in descending order, and `o` must have at least one unique element; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the element `l[i]` in `o`, and `k` is not less than 0; `fav` is the element in `o` at the position `f - 1`; `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from the list `o`, and the corresponding value is the count of that element in `o`. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, then the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, or `dic`. `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order, and `l` must have at least one element. Additionally, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.**
