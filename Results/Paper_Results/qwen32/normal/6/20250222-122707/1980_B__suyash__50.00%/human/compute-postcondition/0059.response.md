Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers; `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace and sorted in descending order, and `o` must have at least one unique element; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the element at position `i` in the list `l` within the dictionary `dic` minus the count of `l[i]` in `dic`; `fav` is the element in `o` at the position `f - 1`; `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from the list `o`, and the corresponding value is the count of that element in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order, and `l` must have at least one element; `i` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `k` is less than 0 or not.**
