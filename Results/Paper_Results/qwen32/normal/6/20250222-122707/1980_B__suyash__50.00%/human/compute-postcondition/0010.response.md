Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers; `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b`; `k` equals `n`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop's code and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
