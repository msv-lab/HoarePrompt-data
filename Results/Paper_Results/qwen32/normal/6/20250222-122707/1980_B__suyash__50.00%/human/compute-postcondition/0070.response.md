Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
