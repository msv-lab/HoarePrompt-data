The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` will convert the first and second elements of the list `lst` to integers, find the minimum of these two integers, and add it to the variable `ans`. Given that `lst` has exactly two elements and `ans` is initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained from `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 0, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is updated to be the smaller of the two integers from the list `lst`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
