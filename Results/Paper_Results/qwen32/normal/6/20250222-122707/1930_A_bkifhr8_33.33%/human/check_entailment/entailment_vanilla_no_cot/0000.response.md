Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from working correctly:

1. **Incorrect List Removal**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` both evaluate to 0, so it will always try to remove the element at index 0 twice. Additionally, after removing an element, the list indices shift, so the second removal will not work as intended.

2. **Logic Error**: The loop condition and the logic inside the loop are not correctly structured to handle the removal of pairs of elements. The loop should iterate `n` times, each time selecting the smallest two elements, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both elements from the list.

3. **Sorting**: To achieve the maximum score, the optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest two numbers available. This can be efficiently done by sorting the list and then pairing the smallest numbers together.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The list of numbers is sorted.
- The program then iterates through the sorted list, adding every second element (which is the smaller of each pair) to the score.
- This ensures that the score is maximized by always choosing the smallest available number in each pair.
