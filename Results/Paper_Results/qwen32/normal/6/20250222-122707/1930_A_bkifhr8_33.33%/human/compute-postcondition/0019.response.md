The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed, removing the element at index 2 means the third element in the original split list (since the first element was removed).

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `ans_f` is an empty list; `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` added to itself; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element in the original split list removed; `i` is 4.**

In simpler terms, the third element from the original list of substrings (after the first element was removed) is no longer in `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
