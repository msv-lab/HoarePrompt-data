You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by performing exactly `n` moves, where each move involves choosing two integers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both integers from the list.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - The program then enters a loop that is supposed to iterate `n` times, but the loop condition is incorrect (`for i in range(n * 2)` instead of `for i in range(n)`).

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements in `lst` to `ans`.
   - It then removes the first two elements from `lst`. However, the removal logic is incorrect: `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` will always try to remove the first element twice, and the indices are being calculated incorrectly.

4. **Handling the Last Move:**
   - The `else` block is intended to handle the last move when only two elements remain in `lst`. However, this block is only executed when `len(lst) != 2` is false, which is not the correct condition to handle the last two elements.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `ans_f`.

### Issues Identified:
- The loop condition is incorrect (`for i in range(n * 2)` instead of `for i in range(n)`).
- The logic for removing elements from the list is incorrect.
- The `else` block is not correctly handling the last move.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly implementing the logic to achieve the maximum score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
