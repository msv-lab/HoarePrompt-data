Reasoning: 
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the sum of the minimum values from pairs of integers for each test case. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection**: The program incorrectly assumes that the first two elements of the list will always be the smallest pair. It does not sort the list or ensure that it is selecting the smallest possible pairs in each iteration. This can lead to suboptimal results, as the problem requires selecting the smallest possible pairs to maximize the score.

2. **Incorrect List Removal**: The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, regardless of the loop iteration. This results in incorrect removal of elements from the list.

3. **Loop Condition**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is incorrect and can lead to errors. The loop should continue until all elements have been paired and removed.

To fix these issues, the program should sort the list of integers for each test case, then sum the first `n` elements (which will be the minimums of the `n` pairs). Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, n * 2, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

Given the original program's issues, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
