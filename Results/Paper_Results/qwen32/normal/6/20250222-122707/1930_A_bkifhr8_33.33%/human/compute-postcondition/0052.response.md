Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 1. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has the first and third elements removed. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
