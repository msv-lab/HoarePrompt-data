Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 of the original `lst` are removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the loop or if statement is broken out of without modifying `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 4. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 of the original `lst` are removed from `lst`, and `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` added to itself. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` added to itself, and `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list plus the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has exactly two elements, otherwise `ans_f` remains an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first and third elements removed if `lst` does not have exactly two elements, `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
