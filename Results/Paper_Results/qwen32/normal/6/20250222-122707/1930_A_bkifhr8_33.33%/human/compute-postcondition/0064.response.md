The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is 0, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2**.
