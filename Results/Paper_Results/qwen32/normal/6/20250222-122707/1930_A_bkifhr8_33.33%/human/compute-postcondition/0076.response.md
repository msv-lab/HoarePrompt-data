To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop condition is `for i in range(n * 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the previous value of `n * 2`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2`.
2. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, which translates to `n * 2 + 1`.
3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n * 2 + 1`, and `n` must be such that `n * 2 + 1` is less than `n * 2`, which is not possible directly. However, since we are considering the start of the next iteration, we just need to ensure `i` is incremented correctly.

The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `l`, `lst`) are not part of the loop head and hence do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is either a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with its first and third elements removed or a list with exactly 2 elements, and `i` is `n * 2 + 1`**
