The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst` because `1 * 2` evaluates to 2. 

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed, and its length is not equal to 1. After removing the element at index 2, the list `lst` will have one less element, and the elements that were originally at indices 3 and beyond will now be at indices 2 and beyond, respectively.

The variables `t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` are not modified by the code snippet. The variable `ans` is calculated as the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, and this calculation is not affected by the removal of the element at index 2.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed and the element at index 2 of the original `lst` removed.**
