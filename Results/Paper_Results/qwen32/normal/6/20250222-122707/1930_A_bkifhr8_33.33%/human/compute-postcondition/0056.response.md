The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` is a list of substrings from the input string `l` with the first element removed, and `i` is 2, we can infer that the element at index 2 will be removed from `lst`.

Since `t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` are not directly affected by the removal of an element from `lst`, their states remain the same. The only change is in `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is three times the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is the list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed and the element at index 2 removed, `i` is 2.**
