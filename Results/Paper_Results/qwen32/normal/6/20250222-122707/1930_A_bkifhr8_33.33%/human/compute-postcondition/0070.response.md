The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index 0 from the list `lst` because `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`. Given that the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, this operation will modify `lst` by removing its first element.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` is still greater than the new value of `n` * 2.
- `ans_f` is still a list containing `ans` twice.
- `ans` is still `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` before the removal, but after removal, `ans` will be recalculated based on the new `lst`.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `l` is still the new input string.
- `lst` has been modified by removing its first element.
- `i` is still the previous value of `n` * 2.

Since `lst` has changed, `ans` will need to be recalculated based on the new `lst`. However, the exact new value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in `lst` after the removal. Therefore, we keep the description general for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` after the first element of `lst` is removed, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` has its first element removed, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.**
