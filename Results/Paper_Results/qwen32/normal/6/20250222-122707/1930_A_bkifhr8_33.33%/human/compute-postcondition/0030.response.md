To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables over its iterations.

The loop runs for `n * 2` iterations. During each iteration, it checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. If `lst` has more than two elements, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to `ans` and removes the first and third elements from `lst`. If `lst` has exactly two elements, it adds the minimum of these two elements to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the initial conditions and the provided output states for the first 3 iterations:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.

2. **After 1st iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - If `len(lst) != 2`, `lst` loses its first and third elements.
   - If `len(lst) == 2`, the loop breaks.

3. **After 2nd iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` again.
   - If `len(lst) != 2`, `lst` loses its first and third elements.
   - If `len(lst) == 2`, the loop breaks.

4. **After 3rd iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` again.
   - If `len(lst) != 2`, `lst` loses its first and third elements.
   - If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans_f` is updated to include the minimum of the two elements and the loop breaks.

The loop continues until `lst` has only two elements or until `n * 2` iterations are completed. If `lst` has only two elements at any point, the loop will break, and `ans` will be updated one final time.

### Final Output State

Assuming the loop runs for the full `n * 2` iterations and `lst` is not reduced to two elements before that, `lst` will be empty or have fewer than two elements after sufficient iterations, causing the loop to break after adding the minimum of the available elements to `ans` as many times as possible.

If `lst` is reduced to exactly two elements, the loop will break, and `ans` will be updated with the minimum of these two elements one last time.

Given these scenarios, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `ans_f` remains an empty list because it is never modified in the loop.
- `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration until `lst` is reduced to two elements or the loop completes.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `l` remains the same as the input string.
- `lst` will be either empty or have fewer than two elements if the loop completes without breaking early.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the input string, `lst` is either empty or has fewer than two elements.**
