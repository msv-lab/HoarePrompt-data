Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. All other variables retain their previous values.
