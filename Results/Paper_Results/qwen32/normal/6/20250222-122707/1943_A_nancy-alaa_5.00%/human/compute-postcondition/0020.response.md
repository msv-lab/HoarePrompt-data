Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean value. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables. `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases.**
