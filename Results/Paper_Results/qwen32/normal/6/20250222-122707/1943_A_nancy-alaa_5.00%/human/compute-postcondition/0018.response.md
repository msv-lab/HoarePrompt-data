To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4. This variable does not directly affect the value of `i` in the given code snippet.
2. **`n`**: Greater than `i + 1`. This indicates that `n` is a larger integer than `i + 1`, but its exact value isn't needed to determine `i`.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. This list is used to create the `mpp` Counter object.
4. **`mpp`**: A Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. **`first`**: A boolean value. If `first` is `True` and `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
6. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 in the described process.
7. **`mpp[i]`**: The count of the element `i` in the list `arr`. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1.
- The `first` variable and the condition `mpp[i] == 1` determine whether the loop or if statement is broken out of, but it doesn't directly affect the value of `i` being printed.
- The exact value of `i` depends on the specific execution context, but the problem asks for a precise description based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the current value of `i` at the point of execution. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided and it is only mentioned that it is incremented by 1, we can describe the output as the current value of `i` after the described operations.

Output: **i (where i is the current value of the variable i after the described operations)**
