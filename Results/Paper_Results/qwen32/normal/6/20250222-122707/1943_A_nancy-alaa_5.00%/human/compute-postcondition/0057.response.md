Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
2. `i` is `i + 1`.
3. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`**: The exact initial value of `i` is not provided, but it is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). So, the value of `i` at the point of the `print` statement is one more than its previous value.
2. **Condition `n > i + 1`**: This implies that `n` is greater than the current value of `i` plus one. This condition ensures that there is at least one more iteration possible if `i` were to be incremented again.
3. **Check for `i` in `mpp`**: If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, this condition doesn't affect the value of `i` at the point of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` that will be printed is the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1. Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the printed value as `i + 1` based on the given precondition.

### Output:
Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of i before the increment)**
