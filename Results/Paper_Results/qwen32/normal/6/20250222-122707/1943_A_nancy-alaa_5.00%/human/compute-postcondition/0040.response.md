The code snippet provided simply initializes a boolean variable `first` to `False`. This has no impact on the other variables `n`, `arr`, or `mpp`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `first` is `False`.**
