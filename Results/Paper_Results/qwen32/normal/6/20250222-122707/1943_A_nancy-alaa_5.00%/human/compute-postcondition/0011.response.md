Given the initial state, we know that `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `arr`. The variable `i` is specifically a key in `mpp` where the frequency (`mpp[i]`) is 1. This means `i` is an element in `arr` that appears exactly once.

Since `i` is defined as a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, the print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`, which is an element in `arr` that appears exactly once.

Output: **i (where i is an element in arr that appears exactly once)**
