To determine what will be printed when the `print(i)` statement is executed, we need to understand the context and the flow of the program based on the initial state provided.

### Analysis of Initial State:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4. This represents a number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the value of `i` in the context of the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: Greater than `i + 1`. This implies that `n` is an integer that is at least 2 more than `i`.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers. The exact contents of this list are not specified, but it is used to populate the `mpp` Counter object.
4. **`mpp`**: A Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`. This object is used to check the presence of keys.
5. **`first`**: A boolean value. Its value does not affect the value of `i` in the provided code snippet.
6. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 in both cases (whether `i` is a key in `mpp` or not).

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The value of `i` is determined by the context in which this print statement is placed. However, based on the information provided, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases of the conditional statement involving `mpp`. The exact value of `i` at the point of printing depends on how many times the loop or conditional block has been executed before reaching this point.

Since the exact loop or conditional structure is not provided, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of its relationship to the context. Typically, `i` would be initialized to some starting value (often 0 or 1) and incremented based on the loop or conditional logic.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases and there is no specific initialization value given for `i` in the problem statement, we can only describe the value of `i` in a general sense. The value of `i` will be the number of times the loop or conditional block has executed plus the initial value of `i`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` and the number of iterations are not specified, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is the current value after the loop or conditional block has executed a certain number of times.

Output: **i (where i is the current value after the loop or conditional block has executed a certain number of times)**
