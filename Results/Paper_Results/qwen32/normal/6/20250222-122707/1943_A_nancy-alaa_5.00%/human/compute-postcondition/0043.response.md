To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
3. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. `first` is `False`.
5. The current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Key Points:
- `i` is not a key in `mpp`. This means that `i` is not an element in the list `arr`, or it appears 0 times in `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.
- The value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, but we know that `i` is not a key in `mpp`, meaning it does not appear in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value. However, we know that `i` is not an element of the list `arr` and is not a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is a value not present in the list `arr`)**
