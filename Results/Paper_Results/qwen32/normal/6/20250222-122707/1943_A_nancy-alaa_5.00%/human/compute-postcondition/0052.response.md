Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is `True`. If the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to the next part of the code without any changes to `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, or `first`.**
