For the given task, we need to adjust the states of the objects that appear in the loop head of the for loop. The loop head in the provided code is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop will start with `i` initialized to 0, as per the `range(n)` function. The initial state provided is `i` is `n-1`, which is not correct for the loop to start executing from the beginning. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0.

2. **Variable `n`:** The variable `n` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The state provided does not specify the value of `n`, but for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute properly. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0, and `n` should be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Note that `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
