To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration and what conditions cause it to break.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, or if `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`. If either condition is met, the loop breaks and prints `i`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`, `first` is set to `True`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`**: The loop breaks and prints `i`. This means `i` is the first number that does not appear in `arr`.

2. **If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`**: The loop breaks and prints `i`. This means `i` is the second unique number in `arr`.

3. **If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`**: `first` is set to `True`, but the loop continues. This means `i` is the first unique number in `arr`.

4. **If `mpp[i] > 1`**: The loop continues without any changes to `first`.

The loop will continue until one of the break conditions is met or `i` reaches `n`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know the loop has not yet broken out. This means none of the break conditions have been met for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`.

After all iterations, the loop will either break and print `i` or complete all iterations without breaking. If it completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `n-1` and `first` will be `True` if there was at least one unique number in `arr`.

### Output State Calculation:
- If the loop breaks during any iteration `i` (where `0 <= i < n`), the output state will be `Output State: **i**` and the loop will print `i`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output state will be `Output State: **n-1**` and `first` will be `True` if there was at least one unique number in `arr`.

Given the problem statement and the output states after the first 3 iterations, the most likely scenario is that the loop completes all iterations without breaking. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **n-1**

This means that after all iterations, the loop has not found a number that meets the break conditions, and `i` has reached `n-1`.
