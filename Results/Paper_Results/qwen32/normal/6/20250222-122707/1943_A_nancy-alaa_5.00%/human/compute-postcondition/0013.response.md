Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean value. If `first` is `True` and `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
