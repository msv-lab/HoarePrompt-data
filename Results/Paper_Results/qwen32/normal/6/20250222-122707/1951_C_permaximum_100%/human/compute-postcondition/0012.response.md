To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `tickets_bought < k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with the smallest element removed.
- `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`.
- `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`.
- `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`.
- `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`.
- `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought).

The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`. For the loop to execute again, `tickets_bought` must be adjusted to be less than `k`.

To achieve this, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`, we need to adjust `tickets_to_buy` such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with the smallest element removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy` and must be less than `k`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought) and must be such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`.**
