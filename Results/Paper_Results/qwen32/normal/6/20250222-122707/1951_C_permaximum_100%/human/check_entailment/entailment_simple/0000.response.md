### Reasoning:
The provided program implements a strategy to minimize the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any given day and that buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price. This approach ensures that the tickets are purchased at the lowest possible price, minimizing the total cost. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price and its corresponding day index. This list is heapified to allow efficient retrieval of the minimum price.
   - `total_cost` keeps track of the cumulative cost of tickets bought.
   - `tickets_bought` keeps track of the number of tickets bought so far.
   - `price_increase` keeps track of the cumulative increase in ticket price due to previous purchases.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, the day with the lowest price (adjusted by `price_increase`) is selected using `heapq.heappop(pq)`.
   - The number of tickets to buy on the selected day is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost for the tickets bought on that day is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is updated, and `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on that day.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `total_cost`, which represents the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the tickets are bought in the optimal order to minimize the total cost.

### Correctness:
Given the problem constraints and the logic described, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the greedy strategy of always buying tickets on the cheapest available day and adjusts for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

**Correctness: True**
