### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of purchasing tickets at the minimum cost, given the constraints. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their respective indices. This allows the program to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price.

2. **Buying Tickets:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap (i.e., the day with the lowest price considering the cumulative price increase).
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day) and the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost for the tickets bought on that day is added to the total cost.
   - The number of tickets bought is updated, and the price increase is adjusted accordingly.

3. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is cumulative. Each time tickets are bought, the price for future days increases by the number of tickets bought.

4. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought, and the total cost is returned.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the first example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - Heap: `[(2, 3), (4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0)]`

2. **First Iteration:**
   - Pop `(2, 3)` (price 2, day 3).
   - Buy 2 tickets (since `m = 2` and `k - tickets_bought = 3`).
   - Cost: `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Total Cost: `4`.
   - Tickets Bought: `2`.
   - Price Increase: `2`.
   - Heap: `[(6, 1), (8, 0), (6, 2)]` (prices adjusted to `[10, 8, 6]`).

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - Pop `(6, 1)` (price 6, day 1).
   - Buy 1 ticket (since `m = 2` and `k - tickets_bought = 1`).
   - Cost: `6 * 1 = 6`.
   - Total Cost: `4 + 6 = 10`.
   - Tickets Bought: `3`.
   - Price Increase: `3`.
   - Heap: `[(8, 0), (6, 2)]` (prices adjusted to `[11, 9]`).

4. **Termination:**
   - The required number of tickets (`k = 3`) is bought, and the total cost is `10`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the cost of buying tickets while adhering to the constraints. It efficiently uses a priority queue to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest price, considering the cumulative price increase.

**Correctness: **True**
