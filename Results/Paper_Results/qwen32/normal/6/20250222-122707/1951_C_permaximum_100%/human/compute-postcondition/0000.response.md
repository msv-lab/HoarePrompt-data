The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `pq`, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The list `pq` is created using a list comprehension that iterates over the `prices` list with `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index.**
