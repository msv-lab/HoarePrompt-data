### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` by placing bets under the given rules of the casino. The key points are:
1. Sasha can win `y * k` coins if he bets `y` coins.
2. Sasha can lose `y` coins if he bets `y` coins.
3. Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
4. We need to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` given his initial amount `a`, the multiplier `k`, and the maximum consecutive losses `x`.

The strategy to solve this problem involves calculating the minimum amount of coins `s` that Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins `n` by placing bets. The program calculates this minimum amount `s` by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then needs to recover.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:
1. Initialize `s` to 1, representing the minimum number of coins needed to start betting.
2. For each of the `x` consecutive losses, update `s` to account for the loss and the subsequent bet needed to recover. The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the new value of `s` after each loss.
3. After calculating `s` for `x` losses, compare `s` with the initial amount of coins `a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any `n`, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly implements this logic and checks the condition for each test case. The example provided in the problem statement aligns with the expected output, further validating the correctness of the program.
