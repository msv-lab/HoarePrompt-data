The code snippet `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `s` based on its current value and the value of `k`. Given that `s` is initially 1 and `k` must be greater than 0, we can determine the new value of `s`.

The expression `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`. Since `s` is initially 1, and `k` is greater than 0, `(k - 1)` will be at least 1. Therefore, `s // (k - 1)` will be 0 when `k` is greater than 1, and it will be 1 when `k` is 1 (since 1 // 0 is undefined, but we assume `k` is strictly greater than 1 based on the precondition).

Given that `k` must be greater than 1, `s // (k - 1)` will be 0. Thus, the expression simplifies to `s += 0 + 1`, which means `s` will be incremented by 1.

The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `s` is 2, `i` is 0**.
