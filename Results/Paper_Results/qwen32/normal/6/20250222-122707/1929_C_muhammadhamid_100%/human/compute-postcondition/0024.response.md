The provided code snippet reads three integer values from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The variable `s` is calculated as `x * (2k / (k - 1))` based on the initial state, but this calculation is not part of the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the input; `s` is `x * (2k / (k - 1))`.**
