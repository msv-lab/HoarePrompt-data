The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `x` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is 1, `s` is `3 + (2 // (k - 1))`, `i` is 2**
