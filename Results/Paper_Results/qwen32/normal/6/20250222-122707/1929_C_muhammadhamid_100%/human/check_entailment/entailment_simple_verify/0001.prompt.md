You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains three integers k, x, and a, where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: A series of "Yes" or "No" printed for each of the `t` test cases, where each "Yes" indicates that `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated `s` for that test case, and each "No" indicates that `a` is less than the calculated `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
Sasha starts with `a` coins and can place bets with the following rules:
- If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
- If he loses, he loses the entire bet amount `y`.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any `n`.

### Strategy for the Solution:
The key insight is to determine the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs to ensure he can always recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and still be able to continue betting and potentially reaching any number of coins `n`.

The strategy involves:
- Calculating the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
- This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then calculating the minimum initial bet required to ensure he can continue betting after these losses.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initial Bet**: Start with a bet of `1` coin.
2. **Worst-case Scenario**: For each of the `x` consecutive losses, the bet amount increases in a way that Sasha can still recover.
3. **Calculation**:
   - After the first loss, Sasha needs at least `1 + 1 = 2` coins to bet again.
   - After the second loss, Sasha needs at least `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1` coins to bet again.
   - This pattern continues for `x` losses.
4. **Check Against Initial Coins**: If Sasha's initial coins `a` are greater than or equal to this calculated minimum `S`, he can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs by simulating the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `S`.

Let's break down the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

1. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to `1`, representing the initial bet.
2. **Loop for `x` Losses**: For each of the `x` losses, the program calculates the new minimum required coins `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
3. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

### Verification:
The logic in the program correctly simulates the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and calculates the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs. If `a` is greater than or equal to `S`, Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
