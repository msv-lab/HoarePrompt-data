You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then determines if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the strategy and the logic behind the game.

### Key Insight:
The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b). The player who starts the game (Alice) can always force a win if the total number of coins is odd, and Bob can always force a win if the total number of coins is even. This is because:

- **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):** If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where Bob can mirror her moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob can swap back, and if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can do the same to his wallet, ensuring that Bob always has a move until Alice is left with no coins.
  
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):** If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can ensure she always leaves Bob with an even number of coins after her move. Since Bob will always face an even number of coins, he will eventually be left with no coins, making Alice the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the total number of coins (a + b):

- If `a + b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described above. Therefore, the program is correct.
