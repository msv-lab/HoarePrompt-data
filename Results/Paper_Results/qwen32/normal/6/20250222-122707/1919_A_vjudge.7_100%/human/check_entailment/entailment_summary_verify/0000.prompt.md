You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then determines if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep them and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, and the other player wins. Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Optimal Play**: Since both players play optimally, they will always make the move that maximizes their chances of winning.
2. **Game State**: The game state can be represented by the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who can force the other player into a position where they cannot make a move wins.

### Strategy
The strategy revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`):
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation
The reasoning behind this strategy is based on the fact that each move reduces the total number of coins by 1. Therefore, the parity of the total number of coins alternates between even and odd with each move. If the total number of coins is even initially, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an even number of coins on her turn, eventually leading to Bob's win. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd initially, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an odd number of coins on his turn, eventually leading to Alice's win.

### Code Analysis
The provided code correctly implements the above strategy:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```
The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of the coins and prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

### Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even) → Bob wins.
2. **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd) → Alice wins.
3. **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even) → Bob wins.
4. **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `a + b = 9` (odd) → Alice wins.
5. **Example 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - `a + b = 20` (even) → Bob wins.
6. **Example 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - `a + b = 174` (even) → Bob wins.
7. **Example 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - `a + b = 10339` (odd) → Alice wins.
8. **Example 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - `a + b = 846485` (odd) → Alice wins.
9. **Example 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even) → Bob wins.
10. **Example 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - `a + b = 55134` (even) → Bob wins.

All the examples match the expected output, indicating that the code is correct for these cases.
