To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and the given solution.

The game involves two players (Alice and Bob) who take turns, with Alice starting first. Each player can either swap their wallets or keep their current wallet, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially a game of Nim with a twist. The game can be reduced to a single number representing the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because:

- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where the total number of coins is odd after her turn, and Bob will always face a situation where the total number of coins is even after his turn. Eventually, Alice will be forced to make a move when the total number of coins is 1 (an odd number), and she will lose because she will have to take the last coin.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always face a situation where the total number of coins is even after her turn, and Bob will always face a situation where the total number of coins is odd after his turn. Eventually, Bob will be forced to make a move when the total number of coins is 1 (an odd number), and he will lose because he will have to take the last coin.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
