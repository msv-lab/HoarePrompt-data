Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `test` is greater than or equal to `t`, `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `test`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
