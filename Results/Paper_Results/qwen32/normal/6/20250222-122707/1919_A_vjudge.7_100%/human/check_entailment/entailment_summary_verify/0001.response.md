To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the program's logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing with their wallets containing coins. The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty and they cannot remove a coin). The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner when both players play optimally.

- **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):** If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he always has a move until Alice is left with no coins. Thus, Bob wins.
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):** If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure she leaves Bob with an even number of coins after her move, ultimately leading to Bob being left with no coins. Thus, Alice wins.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

Here is the code again for reference:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It checks if the sum `a + b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Verification:
The logic in the function summary aligns perfectly with the key insight discussed above. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy.

Final: **True**
