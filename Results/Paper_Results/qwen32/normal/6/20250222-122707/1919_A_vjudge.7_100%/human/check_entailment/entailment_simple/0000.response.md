### Reasoning:

The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins that Alice and Bob have together. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves. This ensures that Bob will always have a move as long as Alice has a move. Thus, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that forces the second player (Bob) into a position where he will eventually lose. Thus, Alice wins.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

This strategy aligns with the optimal play described above.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
