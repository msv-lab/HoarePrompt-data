The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the initial values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new input values. The precondition about the sum of `a` and `b` being either even or odd remains valid, but the specific values of `a` and `b` are now the newly input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `test` is greater than or equal to `t`, `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.**
