Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Heap Management**: In `func_1`, the heap management is flawed. The `while` loop that checks `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results. The correct condition should ensure that the popped element is within the valid distance `d` from the current index `i`.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the maximum distance `d` is very small or when the number of bridges `k` is equal to the number of rows `n`.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in each row, ensuring that the constraints are met. One possible solution involves dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(row, d):
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = row[i] + 1
        for j in range(max(0, i - d), i):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + row[i] + 1)
    return dp[-1]

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        k = int(input[index + 2])
        d = int(input[index + 3])
        index += 4
        rows = []
        for _ in range(n):
            rows.append(list(map(int, input[index:index + m])))
            index += m
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = []
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        results.append(min(total_costs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in each row while adhering to the distance constraint `d`. It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
