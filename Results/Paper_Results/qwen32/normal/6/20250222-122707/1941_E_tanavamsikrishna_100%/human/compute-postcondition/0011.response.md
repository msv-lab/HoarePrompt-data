To determine the output of the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`.
   - `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`.
   - `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs` from `costs[0]` to `costs[n-k]`.
   - `i` is `n-k`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - `total_costs` is computed by summing up every `k` consecutive elements of the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs` is `[c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]` and `k` is `2`, then `total_costs` would be `[c1 + c2, c2 + c3, c3 + c4, c4 + c5]`.

3. **Finding `min(total_costs)`:**
   - The `min` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - Since the exact values of `costs` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Given the information, the output of the `print(min(total_costs))` statement will be the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of each consecutive k elements of costs)**
