The provided code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers separated by spaces. These integers are used to populate the `rows` 2D list, which represents the depth of the river cells with dimensions `n` x `m`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, and the first and last elements of each row in `rows` are 0. The code does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `d`; it only modifies the `rows` list by populating it with the input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers; `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each row starts and ends with 0, and the intermediate values are the integers read from the input.**
