You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the grid respectively, k is a positive integer representing the number of consecutive rows for building bridges such that 1 <= k <= n, d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, rows is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions n x m, and the first and last elements of each row in rows are 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs` from `costs[0]` to `costs[n-k]`; `i` is `n-k`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of each consecutive k elements of costs)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in a grid, respectively. `k` is a positive integer representing the number of consecutive rows for building bridges such that 1 <= k <= n. `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions n x m, and the first and last elements of each row in `rows` are 0. The function returns the maximum number of bridges that can be built under the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
