To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This condition can be broken down into the following parts:
1. `heappop(min_heap)` pops the smallest element from the `min_heap`. Let's denote this element as `(x, 2)`, where `2` is the second element of the tuple.
2. The condition then checks if the second element of the popped tuple (which is `2` in this case) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 6
- `min_heap` is `[(x, 2)]`
- `d` is 2

We need to ensure that the loop condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.

Let's calculate the right-hand side of the inequality:
```
i - (d + 2) = 6 - (2 + 2) = 6 - 4 = 2
```

The condition becomes:
```
2 <= 2
```

This condition is true, meaning the loop can execute one more time with the current state. However, to ensure that the loop can continue to execute in the next iteration, we need to adjust the state such that the next popped element from `min_heap` also satisfies the condition.

Since the current `min_heap` only contains one element `[(x, 2)]`, popping it will leave the `min_heap` empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to add another element to the `min_heap` that also satisfies the condition.

Let's add another element `(y, v)` to the `min_heap` such that `v <= i - (d + 2)`. Given that `i - (d + 2)` is `2`, we need `v <= 2`.

Let's add an element `(y, 1)` to the `min_heap`. The new `min_heap` will be `[(x, 2), (y, 1)]`.

State: **`i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[(x, 2), (y, 1)]`, `d` is 2**
