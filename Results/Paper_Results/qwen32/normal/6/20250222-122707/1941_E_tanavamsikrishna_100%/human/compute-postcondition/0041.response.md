The code snippet `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the element `e` onto the `min_heap`. This changes the state of `min_heap` by adding the element `e` to it. The other variables `i`, `d`, and `row[6]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[e]`, `d` is 2, `row[6]` is `e[0] + row[6] + 1`**.

In natural language, this means that the `min_heap` now contains the element `e`, while `i`, `d`, and `row[6]` retain their initial values.
