To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (which is popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `min_heap`: The heap from which tuples are popped.
   - `e[1]`: The second element of the tuple `e` popped from `min_heap`.
   - `i`: The current value of `i`.
   - `d`: The current value of `d`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`i_prev`).
   - `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple `(x, y)` such that `y <= i_prev - d - 1`.
   - All other variables remain the same.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `e` popped from `min_heap` must satisfy `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`min_heap`:** We need to ensure that after popping the current `e`, there is still at least one tuple `(x, y)` in `min_heap` such that `y <= i - (d + 2)`.
- **`i`:** Since `i` is already incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new `i` value maintains the condition with the remaining tuples in `min_heap`.
- **`d`:** `d` remains the same, so no adjustment is needed for `d`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the condition `y <= i_prev - d - 1` from the previous state means that `y <= (i - 1) - d - 1` or `y <= i - (d + 2)`. Therefore, as long as there is at least one tuple `(x, y)` in `min_heap` that satisfies `y <= i - (d + 2)`, the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - (d + 2)`, and all other variables remain the same.**
