### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we have:
   - `n`: number of rows.
   - `m`: number of columns.
   - `k`: number of consecutive rows to build bridges.
   - `d`: maximum distance between supports.
   - A grid of `n` rows and `m` columns representing the depth of the river cells.

2. **Output**: For each test case, output the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns (depth 0).
   - Distance between adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost to install a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

**Function `func_1`**:
- This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.
- It initializes the cost for the first `d` columns.
- It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to the current column, considering the constraint that the distance between supports must be no more than `d`.
- Finally, it returns the cost of the last column.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function handles the main logic for each test case.
- It reads the input parameters and the grid.
- It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for each row individually.
- It then calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
- It outputs the minimum total cost among all these sets.

#### Verification:

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` columns.
   - It uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost is always minimal for the current column based on the previous `d` columns.
   - The final cost of the last column is returned, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports in that row.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input correctly.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It outputs the minimum total cost, which is the correct solution to the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
