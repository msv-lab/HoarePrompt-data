Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`, and the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` where `i` is 2; `i` is 2.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total_costs` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of the `costs` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
