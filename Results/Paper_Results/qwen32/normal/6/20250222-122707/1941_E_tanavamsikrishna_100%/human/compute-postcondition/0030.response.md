The code snippet `heappush(min_heap, e)` adds the tuple `e` to the `min_heap`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, the condition that `min_heap` does not contain any tuples `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - (d + 2)`, or the update of `row[i]` to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The only change is that `e` is now part of `min_heap`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed, `min_heap` contains the tuple `e`, `min_heap` does not contain any tuples `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - (d + 2)`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
