To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 up to, but not including, `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
2. **`len(costs) - (k - 1)`**: This expression determines the upper bound for the loop. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0. This implies that `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

Given the information provided:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`.
- `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

The critical part is ensuring that the length of `costs` is at least `k` so that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Ensure `len(costs) >= k`**: Since `costs` is derived from `rows`, and `rows` has `n` rows, `len(costs)` should be `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `k` for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list; `i` is 0**.
