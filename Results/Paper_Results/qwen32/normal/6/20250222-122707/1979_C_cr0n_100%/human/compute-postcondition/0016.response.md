Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes.
- `vals` is a list of integers.
- `den` is the value returned by applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements in `vals` starting with `den = vals[0]` minus the sum of `vprod`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
- `den` is greater than 0.

### Understanding `vprod`:
- `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
- This means that for each element `r` in `vals`, the corresponding element in `vprod` is the integer division of `den` by `r`.

### Understanding `den`:
- `den` is initially set to `vals[0]`.
- Then, `func_1` is applied cumulatively to all elements in `vals` starting with `den = vals[0]`.
- After that, the sum of `vprod` is subtracted from this cumulative result to get the final `den`.

### The Print Statement:
- The print statement joins the string representations of each element in `vprod` with a space and prints the resulting string.

### Detailed Calculation:
1. **Initial `den`**: `den = vals[0]`
2. **Cumulative Application of `func_1`**:
   - Let's assume `func_1` is a function that, for example, multiplies the current `den` by the next element in `vals`. So, after applying `func_1` cumulatively, `den` becomes `vals[0] * vals[1] * vals[2] * ... * vals[N-1]`.
3. **Sum of `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - So, `vprod` would be `[den // vals[0], den // vals[1], den // vals[2], ..., den // vals[N-1]]`.
4. **Final `den`**:
   - The final `den` is the cumulative result of `func_1` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - However, this final `den` does not affect the calculation of `vprod` since `vprod` is calculated before this step.

### What is Printed:
- The print statement will output the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
- Each element in `vprod` is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.

### Final Output:
Output: **den // vals[0] den // vals[1] den // vals[2] ... den // vals[N-1] (where den is the cumulative result of applying func_1 to all elements in vals starting with den = vals[0] minus the sum of vprod, and vprod is a list of den // r for each r in vals)**

However, to simplify and match the format requested:

Output: **den // vals[0] den // vals[1] den // vals[2] ... den // vals[N-1] (where den is the cumulative result of applying func_1 to all elements in vals starting with den = vals[0] and then subtracting the sum of vprod, and vprod is a list of den // r for each r in vals)**
