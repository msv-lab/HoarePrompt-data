### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of distributing bets on outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The core idea is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the LCM of all multipliers using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers by using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.
   - It applies this function cumulatively over all multipliers to get the overall LCM, stored in `den`.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the bets for each outcome as `vprod[i] = den // vals[i]`. This ensures that the bet for each outcome is a fraction of the LCM, scaled by the multiplier.
   - It then adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of all these bets. The adjusted `den` should be greater than zero for a valid solution.

4. **Validation**:
   - If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets as calculated.

### Verification Against Example Cases:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`.
  - Bets calculated as `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
  - Adjusted `den` is `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`.
  - The bets `14, 21, 6` are valid as the total `41` is less than `3*14=42`, `2*21=42`, and `7*6=42`.
  
- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - LCM of `3, 3` is `3`.
  - Bets calculated as `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`.
  - Adjusted `den` is `3 - (1 + 1) = 1`.
  - The bets `1, 1` are valid as the total `2` is less than `3*1=3` and `3*1=3`.
  
- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`.
  - Bets calculated as `5 // 5 = 1` for all.
  - Adjusted `den` is `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
  - Since `den` is not greater than zero, the output is `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the bets and checks for the validity of the solution based on the problem's requirements. It handles all edge cases as demonstrated in the examples.

**Correctness: True**
