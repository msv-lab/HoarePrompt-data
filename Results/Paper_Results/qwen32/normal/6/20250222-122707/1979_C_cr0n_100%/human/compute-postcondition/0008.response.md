The code snippet provided updates the value of `den` by calling `func_1` with `den` and `x` as arguments. The value of `den` is reassigned to the result of this function call. The other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `x`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the third element in `vals`.**
