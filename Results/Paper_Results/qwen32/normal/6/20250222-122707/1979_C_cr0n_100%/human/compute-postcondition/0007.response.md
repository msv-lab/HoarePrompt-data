The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `vals`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in `vals` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `x` is the next element in `vals` after the first iteration, it means `x` currently holds the second element of `vals`. For the next iteration, `x` should hold the third element of `vals`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the third element in `vals`**
