The code snippet provided takes a string input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `vals`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome.

Given the code, the variable `vals` will be updated to reflect the list of integers obtained from the input. The value of `N` is not directly affected by this code snippet, as it is not reassigned or used in the provided code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer is a multiplier for each outcome.**
