The provided code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `N`, `vals`, `den`, and `vprod`, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `-1`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`.

Output: **-1**
