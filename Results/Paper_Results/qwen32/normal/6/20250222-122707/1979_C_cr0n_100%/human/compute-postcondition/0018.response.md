Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input. It calculates a cumulative value `den` by applying a function `func_1` cumulatively to the elements of `vals`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by each element in `vals`. The function subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the resulting `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.**
