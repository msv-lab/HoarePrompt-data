Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the value returned by applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements in `vals` starting with `den = vals[0]` minus the sum of `vprod`, and `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.**

In human-readable terms: The value of `den` has been updated to be the result of subtracting the sum of the `vprod` list from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
