Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, the solution calculates the bets based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then adjusts these bets to sum up to a certain value, but it does not ensure that the total bet is less than the return for each individual outcome.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided solution:

1. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers.
2. It then calculates a base bet for each outcome such that the sum of these bets is equal to the LCM minus some value.
3. If the calculated value is not positive, it outputs `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

However, the bets calculated in this manner do not necessarily ensure that the total bet is less than the return for each outcome. For example, consider the test case:

```
3
3 2 7
```

The provided solution might output `27 41 12`, but the total bet is `80`. For the first outcome, the return is `3 * 27 = 81`, which is greater than `80`. However, the solution does not guarantee this for all cases, and there might be cases where the total bet is not less than the return for any outcome.

To ensure the solution is correct, the bets should be calculated in a way that guarantees the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome. One possible approach is to use a different strategy, such as setting the bets to `1` for all outcomes except one, and then adjusting the last bet to ensure the total bet is less than the return for each outcome. This approach is not implemented in the provided solution.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided solution is **False**.
