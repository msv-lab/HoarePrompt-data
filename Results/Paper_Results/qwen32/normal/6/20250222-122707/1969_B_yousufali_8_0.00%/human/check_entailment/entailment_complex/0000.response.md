### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It iterates through the list to count the number of 1s (`n`) encountered before each 0.
   - For each 0 encountered, if there have been 1s before it (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
   - The function prints the total cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` `t` times, once for each test case.

The core logic in `func_1` calculates the total cost by counting the number of 1s before each 0 and adding `n + 1` to the cost for each such occurrence. This is because each 0 encountered after a sequence of 1s requires a shift to bring all those 1s before it, and the cost of this shift is the length of the substring (which is `n + 1` where `n` is the count of 1s).

However, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The cost calculation should consider the minimum operations required to bring all 1s before each 0, which involves more complex logic than simply counting 1s before each 0 and adding `n + 1`.

For example, in the third test case `11000`, the optimal strategy involves multiple shifts, and the cost should be calculated based on the minimum operations required, not just the count of 1s before each 0.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
