Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of shifting a substring is defined as the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of a substring can move a '1' to the left of a '0', effectively sorting the string.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the cost, we should aim to shift each '1' to the left of all '0's it needs to be to the right of. The optimal strategy involves counting the number of '1's encountered so far and adding the cost of shifting each '0' past these '1's.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - Reads a binary string as a list of integers.
    - Initializes `n` (count of '1's encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
    - Iterates through the string:
        - Increments `n` for each '1'.
        - For each '0' encountered after at least one '1', adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
    - Prints the total cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - Reads the number of test cases.
    - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The input string is supposed to be a binary string, but `input().split()` is used, which would split the string into a list of substrings separated by spaces. This is incorrect for a binary string.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic seems correct based on the problem description, but the incorrect input handling will lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with input handling, the code does not correctly read the binary string, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
