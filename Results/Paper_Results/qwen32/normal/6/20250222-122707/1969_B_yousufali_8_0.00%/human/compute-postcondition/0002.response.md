To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1()` does. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, so we cannot determine its impact on the variables. Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only state that the function has been called and no other changes have been made to the initial state based on the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `func_1()` has been called.**
