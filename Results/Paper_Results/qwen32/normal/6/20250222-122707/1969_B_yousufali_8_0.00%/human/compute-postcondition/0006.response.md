To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of `func_1()` on the given variables. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables `t` and `_`. 

However, based on the given initial state and the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only assume that `func_1()` might modify `t` and `_` in some way. Without specific details about what `func_1()` does, we cannot provide a more precise output state.

Given the lack of information, the output state can only reflect the unchanged state of the variables unless we assume `func_1()` does not modify them.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 2.**
