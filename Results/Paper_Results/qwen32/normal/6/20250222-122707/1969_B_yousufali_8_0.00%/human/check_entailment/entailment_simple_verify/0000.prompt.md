You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0. The function iterates over the list s to calculate a value based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the original binary list, `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list (or 0 if the last element is 0), and `ans` is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list `s`)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` expects the input to be a list of integers separated by spaces, which is not consistent with the problem description. The problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers separated by spaces.

2. **Logic for Calculating Cost**: The provided code attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. However, the logic is incorrect. The current implementation counts the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and adds `n + 1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of '1's. This does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle several edge cases correctly:
   - Strings that are already sorted in non-descending order should return a cost of 0.
   - Strings with alternating '0's and '1's may require multiple shifts, and the current logic does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
```
2
```
While this example might seem to work, it is not a comprehensive test. Let's consider another example:

**Input:**
```
1
11000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
```
9
```
However, the code works for this specific example due to the way it counts the '1's before each '0', but this is not a general solution.

**Counterexample:**
```
1
1001
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
```
2
```
In this case, the provided code incorrectly calculates the cost as 2, whereas the correct minimum cost is 3.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all possible cases, thus making it incorrect.
