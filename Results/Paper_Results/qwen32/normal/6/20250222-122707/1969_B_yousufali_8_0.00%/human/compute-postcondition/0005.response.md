The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called twice. This implies that the loop has already executed twice (since `_` would have taken the values 0 and 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) and `t` must be at least 3 (so that the loop can execute a third time).

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `func_1()` has been called twice**. 

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the correct state adjustment is:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 2**.
