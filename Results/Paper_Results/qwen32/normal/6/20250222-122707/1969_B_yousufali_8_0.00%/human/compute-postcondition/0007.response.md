To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given initial state and output states after the first few iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This loop will execute `func_1()` a total of `t` times. The variable `_` is a loop variable that takes on the values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `func_1()` has been called once.
- After 2 iterations: `func_1()` has been called twice.
- After 3 iterations: `func_1()` has been called three times, and `_` is 2.

Following this pattern, after `t` iterations, `func_1()` will have been called `t` times, and `_` will have taken on the values 0 through `t-1` during the loop's execution.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body and only serves as a counter for the number of iterations, its final value after the loop ends is not relevant to the output state. The only relevant information is that `func_1()` has been called `t` times.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the function `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the value of `t`, and `t` remains unchanged from its initial value.
