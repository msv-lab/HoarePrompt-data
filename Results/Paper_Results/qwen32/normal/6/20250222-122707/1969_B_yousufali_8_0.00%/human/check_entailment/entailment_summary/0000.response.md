Reasoning: 

The given problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` seems to be responsible for calculating the cost of sorting a single binary string, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string as required by the problem description. Instead, it calculates the total count of substrings of consecutive 1s that end at each 0 in the given binary list `s`. This does not align with the problem's requirement to perform cyclic shifts and calculate the associated cost.

To solve the problem, `func_1` should implement an algorithm that calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts. One possible approach is to count the number of 1s before each 0 and calculate the cost based on these counts, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the implementation of `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
