The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n + 1`.**
