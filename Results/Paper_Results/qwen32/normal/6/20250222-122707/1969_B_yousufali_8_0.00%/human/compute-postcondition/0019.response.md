The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding `n + 1` to its current value. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly changed by this line of code, but their states are implied to be part of the precondition. The precondition states that `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element. It also mentions that `i` is `i + 1` and if `s[i]` was 1, then `n` is `n + 1`. However, these modifications to `i` and `n` are not part of the provided code snippet and should be considered as having already occurred.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element; `i` is `i + 1`; if `s[i]` was 1, then `n` is `n + 1`; `ans` is `ans + n + 1`.**

In simple terms, the output state means that the list `s` remains unchanged, the index `i` has already been incremented by 1, `n` has already been incremented by 1 if the element at the original `i` in `s` was 1, and `ans` has been updated by adding `n + 1` to its previous value.
