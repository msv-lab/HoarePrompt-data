Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set, with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3; `cd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
        cd += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` equals 1, `cd` is 1; otherwise, `cd` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` equals 1, then `cd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
