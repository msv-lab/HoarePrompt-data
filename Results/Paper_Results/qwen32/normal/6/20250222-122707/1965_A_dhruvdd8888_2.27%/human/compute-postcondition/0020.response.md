Postcondition: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` equals 1, then `cd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
