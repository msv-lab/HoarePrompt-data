The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `N`, `nums`, or `i`. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Therefore, the values of `N`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
