Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `N`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement.
