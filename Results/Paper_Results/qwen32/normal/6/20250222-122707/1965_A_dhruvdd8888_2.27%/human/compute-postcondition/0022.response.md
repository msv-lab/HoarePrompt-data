The code snippet `cd += 1` increments the value of the variable `cd` by 1. The other variables `N`, `nums`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cd` is increased by 1.**
