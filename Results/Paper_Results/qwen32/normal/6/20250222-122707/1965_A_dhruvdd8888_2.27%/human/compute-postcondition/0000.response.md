The provided code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected or modified by this single line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `N` (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer.**
