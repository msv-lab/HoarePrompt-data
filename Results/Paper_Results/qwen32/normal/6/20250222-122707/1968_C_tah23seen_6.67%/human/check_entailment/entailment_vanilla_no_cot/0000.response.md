Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the logic used to construct `a` does not guarantee that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. 

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The initial value of `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, which is not necessarily correct. The problem does not specify what `a_1` should be, but it should be chosen such that the subsequent elements of `a` satisfy the modulo conditions.
2. The loop logic for constructing the rest of the array `a` is flawed. The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent while loop are not sufficient to ensure that `ans[i + 1] mod ans[i] = arr[i + 1]`.

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large value (e.g., `x_2 + 1`) and then set each subsequent `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed to be exactly `x_i` more than a multiple of `a_{i-1}`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a_1 can be any value greater than x_2
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This version of `func_1` ensures that the array `a` satisfies the required conditions.
