arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 representing the number of elements in the array a, which is one more than the length of arr. The function is called for each test case, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
