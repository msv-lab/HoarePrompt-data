You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 representing the number of elements in the array a, which is one more than the length of arr. The function is called for each test case, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array `a` from the given array `x` is flawed. Let's examine the code and identify a potential issue.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is fine as long as `arr[0] + 1` is greater than `arr[0]`.

2. **Loop for Constructing `a`**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n - 3` (since `range(n - 2)`).
   - For each iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i]` because `arr[i] + ans[i] % ans[i]` is always `arr[i]`.
   - However, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent `while` loop are unnecessary and do not correctly handle all cases. They attempt to adjust `ans[i + 1]` to be greater than `arr[i + 1]`, but this adjustment might not maintain the required modulo condition for subsequent elements.

3. **Final Element of `a`**:
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This is intended to ensure that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`, but the previous adjustments might have disrupted this condition.

### Potential Issue

The main issue arises from the unnecessary and potentially incorrect adjustments made in the `while` loop. These adjustments might lead to an array `a` that does not satisfy the modulo conditions for all elements.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
1
3
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 4
```

Explanation:
- `a_1 = 2` (can be any number greater than or equal to 2)
- `a_2 = 3` (since `3 % 2 = 1`)
- `a_3 = 4` (since `4 % 3 = 1`)

However, the given program might produce an incorrect output due to the flawed logic in the `while` loop. For instance, it might produce an output like `2 3 3`, which does not satisfy the condition `a_3 % a_2 == 1`.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle all cases correctly, and there are scenarios where it might produce an incorrect array `a`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
