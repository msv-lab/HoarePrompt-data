The provided code snippet modifies the `ans` list by adding the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, we know the first two elements of `ans` have specific values, and the rest are initialized to 0 with the condition that `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's break down the impact of the code snippet on the `ans` list:
- `ans[0]` is initially `arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[1]` is initially `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[i + 1]` for `i >= 1` is initially 0 but will be updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

After executing the code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]`, the value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `ans[i]` (which was 0 before the operation) plus `ans[i]`, so `ans[i + 1]` will now be equal to `ans[i]`.

Therefore, after the code execution:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[1]` remains `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[2]` will be `ans[1]` (which is `2 * arr[0] + 1`).
- The rest of the elements in `ans` (i.e., `ans[3]` to `ans[n-1]`) are still 0 and will remain 0 because the code snippet only modifies `ans[i + 1]` and not the subsequent elements.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are 0.**
