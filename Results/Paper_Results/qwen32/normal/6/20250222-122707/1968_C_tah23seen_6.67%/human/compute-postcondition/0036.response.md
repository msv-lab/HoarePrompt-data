Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
