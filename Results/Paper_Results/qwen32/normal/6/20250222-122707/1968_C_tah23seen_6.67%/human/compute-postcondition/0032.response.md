Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is adjusted to be the smallest value greater than `arr[5]` that follows the pattern `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]` if `ans[5]` was initially less than `arr[5]`; `i` is 4. If `ans[5]` was not less than `arr[5]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans` beyond the initial adjustment of `ans[5]` to `arr[4] + ans[4]`.**
