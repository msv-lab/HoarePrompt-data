Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and the rest are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[1]` and its previous values, and so on until `ans[n-1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[n-2]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[n-2]` and its previous values. Otherwise, the values of `ans` remain as initially defined with `ans[0]` as `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` as `2 * arr[0] + 1` and the rest of the elements in `ans` as 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`, and `ans[k + 1]` is `ans[k]` with `arr[k + 2]` being greater than `ans[k + 2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is adjusted to be the smallest value greater than `arr[5]` that follows the pattern `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]` if `ans[5]` was initially less than `arr[5]`; `i` is 4. If `ans[5]` was not less than `arr[5]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans` beyond the initial adjustment of `ans[5]` to `arr[4] + ans[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
