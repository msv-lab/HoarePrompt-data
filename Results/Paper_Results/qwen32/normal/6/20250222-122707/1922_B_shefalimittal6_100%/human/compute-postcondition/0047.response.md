The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the program state. However, the loop will execute `t` times, so we need to adjust `t` to reflect the remaining iterations.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect that one iteration has been completed.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` should be decremented by 1.

Other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `idx`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**
