The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to be the integer value of the element at the position `idx` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 2, `x` is `int(data[idx])`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is now the integer value of the element at the position `idx` in the `data` list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
