The given Python code snippet is:

```python
ans = 0
```

This line initializes the variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `idx`, `cnt`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an integer from `data` corresponding to the current iteration) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**
