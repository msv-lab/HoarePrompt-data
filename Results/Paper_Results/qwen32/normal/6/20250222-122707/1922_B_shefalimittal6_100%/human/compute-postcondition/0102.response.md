The code snippet provided is simply `idx += 1`, which increments the value of `idx` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now 2.
- `idx` is `idx + 2n + 4`.
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is now 2).
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body.
- `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.
- `x` is `int(data[idx])`.

The only change due to the code snippet `idx += 1` is that `idx` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now 2, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 5`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is now 2), `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
