The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will take on the integer value of the element in the `data` list at the position specified by `idx`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `int(data[idx])`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `results` remain as given**.
