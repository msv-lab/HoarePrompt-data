The code snippet provided is:
```
cnt += v[i]
```

This line of code increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`
- `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`
- `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` is updated by `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

The only variable affected by `cnt += v[i]` is `cnt`, which is incremented by the value of `v[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times, `i` is `i + 1`. If `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `cnt` is now `cnt + 2 * v[i]`, and all other variables remain as described in the initial state.
