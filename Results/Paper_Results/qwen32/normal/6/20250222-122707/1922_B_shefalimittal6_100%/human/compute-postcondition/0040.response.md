The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` based on the current values of `cnt` and `v[i]`. Specifically, it adds `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `v[i]` meets certain conditions that are not directly addressed in the provided code snippet.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` is incremented by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `idx`, `cnt`, `i`) remain as given, except for `ans` which is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**
