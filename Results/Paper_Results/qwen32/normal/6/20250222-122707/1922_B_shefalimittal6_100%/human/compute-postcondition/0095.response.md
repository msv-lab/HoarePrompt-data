Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now 1, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 3`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is now 1), `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**

Explanation: The value at index `x` in the list `v` is incremented by 1, making `v[x]` equal to 1. The sum of all elements in `v`, denoted as `cnt`, is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.
