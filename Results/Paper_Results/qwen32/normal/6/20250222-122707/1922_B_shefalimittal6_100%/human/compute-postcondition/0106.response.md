Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n` (or reflects the count of each unique `x` value), `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `results` now includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous states.
