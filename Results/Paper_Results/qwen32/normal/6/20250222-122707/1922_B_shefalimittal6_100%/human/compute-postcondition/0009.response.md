The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `int(data[idx-1])`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given; `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
