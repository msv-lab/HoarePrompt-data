The given code snippet only reads the input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. It does not process or change any of the initial state variables `t`, `n`, or `a_i`. 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are defined with specific constraints. The code does not modify these values or introduce any new ones that would change the state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `input` holds the entire input read from standard input.**
