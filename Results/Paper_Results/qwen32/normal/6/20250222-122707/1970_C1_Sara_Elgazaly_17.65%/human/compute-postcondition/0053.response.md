The code snippet `s = not s` changes the boolean value of `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is `False`, executing this line will change `s` to `True`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `lst[x]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the starting node `u_1`, `y` is the last node visited before `lst[x]` became empty, `lst[x]` is an empty list, `s` is True.**
