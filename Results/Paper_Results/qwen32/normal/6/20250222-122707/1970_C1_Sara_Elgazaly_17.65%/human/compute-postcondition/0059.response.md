The `break` statement will exit the most inner loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `lst[x]`, `s`, or `lst[y]`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
