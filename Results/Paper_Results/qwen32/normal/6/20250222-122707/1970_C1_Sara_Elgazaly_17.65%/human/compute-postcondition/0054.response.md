The only variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to a non-empty list.

State: **`x` is the starting node `u_1`, `y` is the last node visited before `lst[x]` became empty, `lst[x]` must be a non-empty list, `s` is True**.
