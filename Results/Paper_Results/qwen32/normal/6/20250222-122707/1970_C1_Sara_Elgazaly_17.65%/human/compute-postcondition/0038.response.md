Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node visited before `x` became a leaf (and `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`), `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where the path from the starting node to the leaf node has all intermediate nodes' adjacency lists reduced (and `lst[x]` has one less element), `s` is False, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**
