The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst`. This does not change the values of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, or the starting node `u_1`. The variables `x` and `y` are already assigned specific values from the input, and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
