n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of n-1 tuples where each tuple (u, v) contains integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and start_node is a list of t integers where each integer 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n represents the starting node for each round. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.
