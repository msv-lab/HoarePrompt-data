The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state describes the properties of `n` and `t`, and the structure of the tree, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. Since t=1, there is exactly one starting node. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the values of `x` and `y` are now set to the two integers read from the input, while all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
