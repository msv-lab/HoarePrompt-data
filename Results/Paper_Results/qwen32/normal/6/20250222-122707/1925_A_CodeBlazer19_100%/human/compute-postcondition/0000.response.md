The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was already defined with a specific value in the initial state, executing this code will update `t` to the new value provided by the input. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26.**
