The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 26. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be the integers provided as input, and the other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
