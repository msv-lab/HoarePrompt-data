The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the input, but this line of code will overwrite these values with the new input values.

The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input.**
