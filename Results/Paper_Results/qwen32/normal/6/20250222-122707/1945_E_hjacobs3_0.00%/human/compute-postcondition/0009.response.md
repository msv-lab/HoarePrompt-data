To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop condition holds true.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than or equal to `r` for the loop to execute again.

2. **Understand the Current State**: 
   - `array` is a permutation of length `n`.
   - `find` is an integer that exists in `array`.
   - `n` is the length of `array`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`.
   - Depending on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find`, `l` and `r` are adjusted:
     - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
     - If `array[mid] < find`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `r` is set to `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `l` is greater than `r` after the previous iteration, we need to adjust `l` and/or `r` to make the condition `l <= r` true.
   - Since we are only allowed to adjust `l` and `r`, we can set `l` to any value less than or equal to `r` or `r` to any value greater than or equal to `l`.

Given that the problem does not provide specific values for `l` and `r` after the previous iteration, we can adjust them to ensure the loop condition holds true. For simplicity, we can set `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1` (the initial values before any adjustments), ensuring `l <= r` is always true.

**Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
