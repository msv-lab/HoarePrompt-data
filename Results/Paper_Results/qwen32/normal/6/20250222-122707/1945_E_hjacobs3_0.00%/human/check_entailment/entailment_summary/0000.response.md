Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The goal is to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. However, the program provided does not perform any swaps and instead directly checks if the binary search result matches the index of `x` in the array.

The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array but does not modify the array to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. It only checks if the final index `l` from the binary search matches the index of `x` in the array and prints `1` and the indices if they do not match, or `0` if they do. This approach does not guarantee that a binary search on the modified array will end with `p_l` equal to `x`.

The correct approach would involve strategically swapping elements to ensure that the binary search algorithm will correctly identify `x` at the index `l` after at most two swaps. The provided program does not implement this logic and thus does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
