Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**

Natural language: The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
