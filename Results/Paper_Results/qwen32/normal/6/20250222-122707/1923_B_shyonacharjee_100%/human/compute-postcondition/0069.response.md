The code snippet provided sets the variable `can_survive` to `True`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-2\) such that \(0 \leq t-2 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True.**
