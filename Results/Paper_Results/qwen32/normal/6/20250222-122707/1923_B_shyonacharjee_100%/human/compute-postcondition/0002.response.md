Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an input integer within the specified range. The values of `n` and `k` are newly assigned based on the integers provided in the second input line, split and converted from the input.
