Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, where each tuple is formed by pairing elements from `x` and `a`, and `monsters` must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + H`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains `True`.**
