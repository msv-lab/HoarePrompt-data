The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `x`. This means `x` is now a list of integers that were not previously defined in the initial state.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line.**
