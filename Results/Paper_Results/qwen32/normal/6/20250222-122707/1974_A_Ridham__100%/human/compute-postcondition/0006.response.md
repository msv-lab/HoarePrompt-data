The value of `total_space` is calculated as the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. Given that `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` will be `x + y * 4`. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `result`, `space_x`, and `space_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.**
