The code calculates `extra_screen` by dividing `extra_space` by 15. This affects only the value of `extra_screen`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`. Additionally, `extra_space` is divisible by 15. `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`.**
