To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the `result` list accumulates the results.

### Loop Execution Summary:
- **Input**: `n` test cases, each with `x` and `y` values.
- **Loop Iteration**: For each test case, the loop calculates the space required for `x` and `y`, determines the number of screens needed to accommodate `y` (`screen_require_for_y`), and calculates the remaining cells on those screens.
- **Condition Check**: If `x` fits within the remaining cells, it adds `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for `x` and adds `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list.
- **Loop Termination**: The loop runs `n` times, processing each test case.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: Will be `0` because the loop runs `n` times and decrements `n` with each iteration until it reaches `0`.
- **`result`**: A list containing the number of screens required for each test case, calculated as described above.
- **`x` and `y`**: These variables will hold the values of the last test case processed by the loop.
- **`space_x` and `space_y`**: These variables will hold the values calculated for the last test case.
- **`total_space`**: This will hold the value of `space_x + space_y` for the last test case.
- **`screen_require_for_y`**: This will hold the number of screens required for `y` in the last test case.
- **`remaining_cells`**: This will hold the number of remaining cells on the screens for `y` in the last test case.
- **`extra_space` and `extra_screen`**: These will hold the values calculated for the last test case if `x` did not fit within the remaining cells.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is 0, `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case, `x` and `y` are the values of the last test case, `space_x` is `x` from the last test case, `space_y` is `y * 4` from the last test case, `total_space` is `space_x + space_y` from the last test case, `screen_require_for_y` is the number of screens required for `y` in the last test case, `remaining_cells` is the remaining cells on the screens for `y` in the last test case, `extra_space` and `extra_screen` are the additional space and screens required for `x` in the last test case if `x` did not fit within the remaining cells.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` will be `0`, `result` will contain the number of screens needed for each test case, and the other variables will reflect the values from the last test case processed.
