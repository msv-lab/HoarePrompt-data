Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case.
3. `x` and `y` are the values of the last test case.
4. `space_x` is `x` from the last test case.
5. `space_y` is `y * 4` from the last test case.
6. `total_space` is `space_x + space_y` from the last test case.
7. `screen_require_for_y` is the number of screens required for `y` in the last test case.
8. `remaining_cells` is the remaining cells on the screens for `y` in the last test case.
9. `extra_space` and `extra_screen` are the additional space and screens required for `x` in the last test case if `x` did not fit within the remaining cells.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Analysis:
- The `result` list contains integers representing the number of screens required for each test case.
- The `print` statement will join each integer in the `result` list into a string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

### Output Description:
- Since `n` is 0, it implies that there are no test cases to process (as `n` typically represents the number of test cases).
- Therefore, the `result` list is empty.

### Final Output:
Given that the `result` list is empty, the `'\n'.join(map(str, result))` will produce an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
