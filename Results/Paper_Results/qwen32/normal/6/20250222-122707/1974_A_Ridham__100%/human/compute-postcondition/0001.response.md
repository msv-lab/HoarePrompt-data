The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. No other variables are modified. The initial state of `n` (the number of test cases) and `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^4) remains unchanged, as does the data in the next `t` lines which contain pairs of integers `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`; `result` is an empty list.**
