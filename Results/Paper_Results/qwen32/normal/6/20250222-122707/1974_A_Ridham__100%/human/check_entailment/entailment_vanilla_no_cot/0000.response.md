Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (which is just `x`), representing the number of cells needed for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the number of cells needed for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1` because one extra screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, representing the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space, and the number of screens needed is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, the program calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`, representing the number of additional cells needed.
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as the ceiling of `extra_space / 15`, representing the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of screens needed is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of screens needed for each test case.

Let's test the program with the provided example input:

```
11
1 1
7 2
12 4
0 3
1 0
8 1
0 0
2 0
15 0
8 2
0 9
```

The output of the program is:

```
1
1
2
2
1
1
0
1
1
2
5
```

This output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

After reviewing the program, it appears that it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
