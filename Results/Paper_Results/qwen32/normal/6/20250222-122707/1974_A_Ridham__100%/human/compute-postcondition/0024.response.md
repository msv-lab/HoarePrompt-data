The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since the loop iterates `n` times, and `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

Given that the loop executes `n` times, at the start of each iteration, `n` should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to decrement `n` by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is the number of additional screens required based on the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`), rounded up to the nearest integer.

At the start of the next iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1.
