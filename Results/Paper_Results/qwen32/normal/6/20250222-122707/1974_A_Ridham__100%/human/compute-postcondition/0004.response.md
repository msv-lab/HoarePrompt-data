The code snippet `space_x = x * 1` assigns the value of `x` to `space_x` since multiplying any number by 1 results in the number itself. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**
