The code snippet provided calculates `space_y` by multiplying the value of `y` by 4. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `result`, and `space_x` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `space_y`, which is now equal to `y * 4`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**
