Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32; `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0; `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A' and was initially 0, otherwise `bc` is 2; `s` is a new string input provided by the user and must have at least one character; `q` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next character in `s`.**
