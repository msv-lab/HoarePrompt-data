The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `g` and `h`. This means that the values of `g` and `h` will be updated based on the input, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are integers read from the input.**
