Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to calculate the area of a square given its four corners.
- The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- We are given `t` test cases, each with four lines of coordinates.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
- It reads four pairs of coordinates.
- It calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points.
- It prints the smaller of the two squared distances.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` and between `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`. However, it does not ensure that these points are opposite corners of the square.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the points are not in the expected order or when the points do not form a square.

### Test Case Evaluation
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works correctly:

#### Test Case 1
```
Input:
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2

Expected Output:
9
```
- The distance between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 5)` is `9`.
- The distance between `(1, 5)` and `(4, 2)` is also `9`.
- The program correctly outputs `9`.

#### Test Case 2
```
Input:
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1

Expected Output:
4
```
- The distance between `(-1, 1)` and `(1, -1)` is `8`.
- The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(-1, -1)` is also `8`.
- The program incorrectly outputs `8` instead of `4`.

#### Test Case 3
```
Input:
1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

Expected Output:
784
```
- The distance between `(45, 11)` and `(17, 39)` is `784`.
- The distance between `(45, 39)` and `(17, 11)` is also `784`.
- The program correctly outputs `784`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not ensure that the points are opposite corners of the square, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation
The program fails to correctly identify the opposite corners of the square, which can lead to incorrect distance calculations. For example, in Test Case 2, the program calculates the distance between non-opposite corners, resulting in an incorrect area.
