To determine what will be printed by the `print(x)` statement, we need to follow the given initial state and the calculations provided.

1. **Identify the Variables and Calculations:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`: Integers read from the input.
   - `n`: Calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
   - `x`: Calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
   - It is given that \(x \leq n\).

2. **Determine the Value of `x`:**
   - `x` is explicitly calculated using the formula \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
   - The exact values of `c`, `g`, `d`, and `h` are not provided, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `x`.

3. **Formulate the Output:**
   - The `print(x)` statement will output the value of `x` based on the provided formula.
   - Since the exact values of `c`, `g`, `d`, and `h` are not specified, we can only describe `x` in terms of the formula.

Thus, the output will be the result of the formula \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

Output: **x (where x is calculated as (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h))**
