Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of a square given its corner coordinates. Instead, it calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller squared distance. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To find the area of the square, we need to determine the length of one of its sides. Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, we can find the length of a side by calculating the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners. The area of the square is then the square of this side length.

Here is the correct approach:
1. Read the coordinates of the four corners.
2. Identify two adjacent corners (their x or y coordinates should differ by the side length of the square).
3. Calculate the side length by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the adjacent corners.
4. Compute the area as the square of the side length.

Given the incorrect logic in the program, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
