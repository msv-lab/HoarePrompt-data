The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The number of test cases `t` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a` and `b`, while `t` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
