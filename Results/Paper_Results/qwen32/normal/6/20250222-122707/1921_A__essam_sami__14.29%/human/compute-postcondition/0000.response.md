The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. It does not process any further input or perform any calculations. Therefore, the only change is that the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The coordinates of the corners of the squares and their areas are still to be read.**
