Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. The values of `a` and `b` remain as they were initially read from the input. Additionally, `c` and `d` are now assigned the values read from the next input, split into two integers.
