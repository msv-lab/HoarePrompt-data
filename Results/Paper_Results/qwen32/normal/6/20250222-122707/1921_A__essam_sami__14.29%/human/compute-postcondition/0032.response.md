Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are new integers read from the input; `n` is recalculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is recalculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; `steps` is 5; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input. If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
