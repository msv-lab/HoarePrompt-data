The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line
- `tmp` is `a[0]`
- If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1**
