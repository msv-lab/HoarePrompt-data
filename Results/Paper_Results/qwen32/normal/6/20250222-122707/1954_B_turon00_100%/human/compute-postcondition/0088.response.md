The provided code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement will print the value `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `cnt`.
2. The initial state describes the relationships and values of these variables but does not influence the output of the `print(-1)` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(-1)` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
