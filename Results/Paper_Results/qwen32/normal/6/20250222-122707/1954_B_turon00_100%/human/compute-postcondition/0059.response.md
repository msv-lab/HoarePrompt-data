Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their relationships:

1. `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. This means `ans` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `cnt`.
2. `n` is not equal to 1.
3. `ans` is not equal to `n`.

From the provided initial state, we know that `ans` is updated based on the comparison with `cnt`, but we do not have explicit values for `ans` or `cnt`. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `ans` in terms of the given conditions.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the current value of `ans`, which is the minimum value it has taken so far in comparison with `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between its previous value and cnt)**
