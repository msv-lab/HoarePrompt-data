Postcondition: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` equals `tmp` and `cnt` is either 1 or 2; otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n` before, or `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if `ans` was not `n` before. `t` remains 2, `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
