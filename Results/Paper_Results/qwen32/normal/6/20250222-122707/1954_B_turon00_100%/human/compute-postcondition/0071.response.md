The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `n`, and `cnt` is 0. Since `cnt` (which is 0) is less than `n` (which is a positive integer greater than 0), `ans` will be updated to 0.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
