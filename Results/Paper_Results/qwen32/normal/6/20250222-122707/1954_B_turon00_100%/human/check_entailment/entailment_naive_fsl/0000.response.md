Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of identical elements determines the answer, which is not always true.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation to make all elements the same. However, removing one element (e.g., the middle `2`) will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 1]` which is not beautiful because no operation can make all elements the same.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Actual Output:**
- The code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. The issue arises because the logic in the code does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

The code needs a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. It should consider all possible ways to break the beautiful property by removing elements and find the minimum among them. The current implementation does not achieve this correctly.
