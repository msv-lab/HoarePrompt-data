To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration for Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the loop reads `n` (the length of the list) and `a` (the list of integers).
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of `a` and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check on `ans` and `cnt` to update `ans`.
   - It prints `-1` if `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`; otherwise, it prints `ans`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will change with each iteration, but the final output for each test case is determined by the value of `ans` after processing that test case.
   - The final output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of a single test case.

Given the loop processes `t` test cases, the output state will be a sequence of `t` printed values, each of which is either `-1` or the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal, excluding the case where all elements are the same.

**Output State: **The output state after all iterations is a series of `t` printed values, where each value is either `-1` if `n` is 1 or all elements in `a` are the same, or the minimum length of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal.**

In natural language: After processing all test cases, the output will be a series of `t` results, each indicating either `-1` if the list has only one element or all elements are the same, or the smallest length of a sequence of consecutive identical elements in the list.
