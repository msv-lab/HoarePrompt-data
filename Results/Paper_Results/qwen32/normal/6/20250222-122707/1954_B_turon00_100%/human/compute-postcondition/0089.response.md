Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `t` is 2; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the input list of integers; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0 unless the last elements of `a` are all equal to `tmp`, in which case `cnt` is the count of these elements; `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`**
