Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, no further changes are made to `ans` and `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`. `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
