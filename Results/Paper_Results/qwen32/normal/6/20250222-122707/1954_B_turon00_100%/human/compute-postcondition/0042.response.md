The code snippet provided resets the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `cnt` has been reset, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0.**
