### Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of consecutive equal elements in the array. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

The core issue is that the solution does not account for the structure of the array and the operation allowed (replacing an element with its neighboring equal element). The solution focuses on finding the shortest segment of consecutive equal elements, which is not sufficient to determine whether removing elements will make the array non-beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the longest segments of consecutive equal elements and how removing elements from these segments can affect the array's beauty. Specifically, if the array can be divided into segments where each segment is a palindrome (which it is, given the problem statement), then removing elements from the middle of these segments will help in making the array non-beautiful.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Identifying the longest palindromic segments.
2. Calculating the minimum number of elements to remove from these segments to break the palindromic structure.

Given the current solution's logic, it fails to correctly determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful in all cases. For example, in the case of `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the solution would incorrectly identify `3` as the minimum segment length and return `3`, whereas the correct answer is `3` because removing the middle `3` is sufficient to make the array non-beautiful.
