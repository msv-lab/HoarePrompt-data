To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans`**: This variable holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
2. **`t`**: This is a constant integer with a value of 2.
3. **`n`**: This is an input integer.
4. **`a`**: This is an input list of integers.
5. **`tmp`**: This variable is initialized to the first element of the list `a` (`a[0]`).
6. **`cnt`**: This variable is 0 unless the last elements of `a` are all equal to `tmp`. If they are, `cnt` is the count of these elements.
7. **Additional Conditions**: `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
- **`tmp`**: Since `tmp` is initialized to `a[0]`, its value is the first element of the list `a`.
- **`cnt`**: This variable will be 0 unless the last elements of `a` are all equal to `tmp`. If the last elements are equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be the count of these elements.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Since the exact previous value of `ans` is not provided, we can only say that `ans` will be the minimum of this previous value and `cnt`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state, the value of `ans` will depend on the previous value of `ans` and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or the count of trailing elements equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, the printed value will be influenced by these factors.

However, without the specific values of the list `a` and the previous value of `ans`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these factors.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt, and cnt is the count of trailing elements in a that are equal to a[0] if all are equal, otherwise cnt is 0)**
