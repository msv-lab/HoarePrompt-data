Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, no further changes are made to `ans` and `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`. `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, and `t` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
