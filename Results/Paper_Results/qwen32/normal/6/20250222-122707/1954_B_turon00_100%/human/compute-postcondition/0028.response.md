Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` if the loop ends with such a sequence, otherwise 0; `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
