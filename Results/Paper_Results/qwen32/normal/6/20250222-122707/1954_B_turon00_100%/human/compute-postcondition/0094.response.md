Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same or `n` is 1, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of such consecutive elements.**
