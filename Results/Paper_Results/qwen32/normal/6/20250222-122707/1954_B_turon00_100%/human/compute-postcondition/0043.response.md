Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
