In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given the problem description, `t` is already provided as an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, and there is no need to adjust `t` since it is already within the valid range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment concerning the loop head variables. The state is already valid for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
