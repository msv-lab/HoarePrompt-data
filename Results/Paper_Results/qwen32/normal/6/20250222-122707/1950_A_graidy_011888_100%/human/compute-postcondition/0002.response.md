The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. The value of `n` must be greater than 0, but it is not modified by the given code snippet.

After the execution of the code snippet, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the integers provided by the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input; `n` must be greater than 0.**
