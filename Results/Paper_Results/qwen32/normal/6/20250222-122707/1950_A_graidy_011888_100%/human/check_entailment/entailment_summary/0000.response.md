Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it checks the relationship between the three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine if they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. The conditions `a < b < c` for a stair and `a < b > c` for a peak are accurately checked, and if neither condition is met, it correctly outputs "NONE". The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior, indicating that the program performs as expected.

Correctness: **True**
