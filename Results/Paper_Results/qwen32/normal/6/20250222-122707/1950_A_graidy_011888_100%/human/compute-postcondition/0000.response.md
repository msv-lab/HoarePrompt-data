The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range 0 to 9. These variables are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `n` is an input integer.**
