Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input; `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, then the relationship `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b` and `b > c`, then `a < b` and `b > c` holds true. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds true; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n`.**

In simpler terms: **The integer `t` remains between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The integers `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their input values, and the relationships among them (`a < b < c` or `a < b > c` or neither) are preserved. The integer `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1, staying less than `n`.**
