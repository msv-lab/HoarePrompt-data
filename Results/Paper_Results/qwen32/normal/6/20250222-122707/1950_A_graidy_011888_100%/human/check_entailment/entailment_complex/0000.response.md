### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - For all other cases, it prints "NONE".

The conditions are correctly implemented in the program:
- The condition for a "STAIR" (`a < b < c`) is checked directly.
- The condition for a "PEAK" (`a < b > c`) is checked using `a < b and b > c`.

The program correctly handles the input constraints and provides the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
