You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input in the last iteration; `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed; `i` is equal to `n` after the loop has finished executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints 'PEAK' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints 'NONE' for any other configuration of `a`, `b`, and `c`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description:

- It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
- It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
- If neither of the conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

The program processes the input as specified, iterating through each test case and printing the appropriate result. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all valid inputs.
