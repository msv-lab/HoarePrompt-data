Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description:

- It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
- It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
- If neither of the conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

The program processes the input as specified, iterating through each test case and printing the appropriate result. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all valid inputs.
