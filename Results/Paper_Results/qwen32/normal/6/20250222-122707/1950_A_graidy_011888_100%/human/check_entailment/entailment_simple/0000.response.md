Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions described in the problem statement.

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`t`), which is a valid integer between 1 and 1000.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits (`a`, `b`, and `c`), which are integers between 0 and 9.
3. It then checks if the digits form a "STAIR" by verifying if `a < b < c`.
4. If the digits do not form a "STAIR", it checks if they form a "PEAK" by verifying if `a < b` and `b > c`.
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

The logic in the program matches the conditions given in the problem description, and the output states in the comments align with the expected results based on the sample input provided.

Correctness: **True**
