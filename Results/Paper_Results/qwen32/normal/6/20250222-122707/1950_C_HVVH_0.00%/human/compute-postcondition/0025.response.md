The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `day`. The variables `t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. The variable `n` is mentioned to be decremented by 1, but the code provided does not reflect this decrement. Therefore, we will assume the decrement operation was intended to be included in the code snippet but was not provided.

Given the provided code, the output state will only reflect the assignment to `day` and the unchanged state of other variables. If we were to include the intended decrement of `n`, it would be reflected in the output state as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. `n` is greater than 0. `day` is `'PM'`.**
