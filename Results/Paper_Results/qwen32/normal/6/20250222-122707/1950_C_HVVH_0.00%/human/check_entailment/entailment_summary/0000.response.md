Reasoning:

Let's break down the code to understand its logic and verify if it correctly converts the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation.

1. The function `func()` starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string in the format `hh:mm`, splits it by the colon `:` into hours `h` and minutes `m`, and converts them to integers.
3. The conversion logic is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles midnight (00:00) as 12:00 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly converts hours from 13 to 23 to their 12-hour format equivalents.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 12, it sets `day` to 'PM' by default. However, if `h` is 12, it specifically sets `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles noon (12:00) as 12:00 PM and ensures that hours from 1 to 11 are correctly marked as AM.
4. Finally, it prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`, ensuring that the hours and minutes are printed with leading zeros if necessary.

The code appears to handle all edge cases, such as midnight (00:00), noon (12:00), and times in the morning and afternoon correctly. The execution summary also indicates that the function performs as expected for the given test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
