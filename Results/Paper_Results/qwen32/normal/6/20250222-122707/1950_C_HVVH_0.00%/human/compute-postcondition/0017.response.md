Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. If `h` was originally 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` was originally 12, `h` remains 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is greater than 0. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively.**
