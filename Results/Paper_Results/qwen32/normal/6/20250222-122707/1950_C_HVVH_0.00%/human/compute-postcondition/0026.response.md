Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. `n` is greater than 0. `day` is `'AM'`.**

Explanation: The variable `day` has been changed from `'PM'` to `'AM'`. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged.
