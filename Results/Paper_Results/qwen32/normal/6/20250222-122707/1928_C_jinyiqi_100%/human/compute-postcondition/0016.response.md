The code snippet provided reverses the list `output1` which contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x)`. This operation does not change the contents of the list, but it does change the order of the elements in the list.

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` â‰¤ `int(x)` in reverse order.**
