Postcondition: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the value of `i` and `output2` contains the previous values plus `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, there is no change to `output1` and `output2`.**
