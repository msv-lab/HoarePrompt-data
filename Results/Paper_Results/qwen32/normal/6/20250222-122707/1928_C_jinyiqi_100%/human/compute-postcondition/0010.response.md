Postcondition: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, and `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
