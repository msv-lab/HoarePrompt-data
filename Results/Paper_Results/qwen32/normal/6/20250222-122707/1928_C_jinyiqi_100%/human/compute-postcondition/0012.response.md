Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, and `output1` contains the value of `i`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` is appended to the list `output1`. The conditions on `x` and `n` remain the same, and the new value of `i` is added to `output1`.
