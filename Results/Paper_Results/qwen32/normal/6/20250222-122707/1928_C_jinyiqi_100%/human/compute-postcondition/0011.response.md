The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters, which are derived from `x`. According to the loop, `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the loop. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Let's adjust the state:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, and `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we adjust `i` to the next value it should take:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is the next integer after its current value, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, and `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

To make it clear, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 4, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, and `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `i_initial` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `i_initial + 1` at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `i_initial + 1`, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, and `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

Final State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**
