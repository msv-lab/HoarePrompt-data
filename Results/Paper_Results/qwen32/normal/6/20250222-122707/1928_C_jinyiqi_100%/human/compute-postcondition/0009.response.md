The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x`, `n`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `output1` is updated to contain this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`, `output2` contains the new value `int(x / i)`.**
