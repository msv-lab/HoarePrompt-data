The code snippet provided is:

```python
i += 1
output1.append(i)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9
- `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`

The code performs two actions:
1. Increments `i` by 1.
2. Appends the new value of `i` to the list `output1`.

Assuming `i` was initially some value `i_initial`, after `i += 1`, `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`. The list `output1` now contains this new value of `i`.

Since the initial values of `x` and `n` are not affected by the code, and the condition `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)` is still relevant, we keep these constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `output1` contains the new value of `i` which is `i_initial + 1`.**
