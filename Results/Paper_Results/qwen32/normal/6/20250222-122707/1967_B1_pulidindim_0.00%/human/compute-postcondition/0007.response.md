Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`.**

In this output state, the variable `g` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `count`, which is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
