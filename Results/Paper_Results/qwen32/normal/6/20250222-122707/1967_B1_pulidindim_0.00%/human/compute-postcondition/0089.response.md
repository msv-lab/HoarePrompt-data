The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given that `g` is `n / 4` and `countmins` is 3, `g` becomes `n / 4 - 3`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `11n/18 + 2/3`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4 - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
