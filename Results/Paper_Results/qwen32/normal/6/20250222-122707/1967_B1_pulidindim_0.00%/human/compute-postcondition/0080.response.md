Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is the first input integer plus `(n / 2 - countmins) / count + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3`. The condition `g < countmins` does not affect the variable values as there is no else part to modify them.**
