Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `(n / 3) - countmins`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count) + 2`**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to be `count - 1`, which means `countmins` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
