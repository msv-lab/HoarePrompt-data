Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (g / count) + 1`, and `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
