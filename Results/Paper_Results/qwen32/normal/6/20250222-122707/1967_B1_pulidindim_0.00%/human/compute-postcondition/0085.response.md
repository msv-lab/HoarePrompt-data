The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`. Given that `count` is 4, the new value of `countmins` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `11n/18 + 2/3`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n/3 - 2`**.
