Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input and `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is the first integer from the input; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2` and `g` is less than `countmins` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of all variables remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
