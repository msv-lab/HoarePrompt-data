Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + 2 * n / 9`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
