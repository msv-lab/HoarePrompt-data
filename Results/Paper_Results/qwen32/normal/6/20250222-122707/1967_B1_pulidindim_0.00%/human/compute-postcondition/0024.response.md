The variable `g` is reassigned the value of `n / count`. The previous value of `g` was `(n / 3) - countmins`, but this is now updated. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count) + 2`**.
