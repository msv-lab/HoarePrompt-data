To determine the output, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- The loop will continue to execute until `count > m` or `g < countmins`.
- The final value of `count` will be `m + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial `n` and the contributions from each iteration.
- `t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `count` will be `m + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `ans` will be the sum of the initial `n` and the contributions from each iteration.

### Key Points:
- The loop's continuation condition is `count > m` or `g < countmins`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `count` will be `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of the initial `n` and the contributions from each iteration.

### Contributions to `ans`:
- Since the exact contributions from each iteration are not detailed in the initial state, we can only describe `ans` in terms of `n` and the contributions from each iteration.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the final value of `count` will be `m + 1`, and `ans` will be `n` plus the sum of contributions from each of the `m` iterations.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the final output of the `print(int(ans))` statement will be the integer value of `ans`, which is the initial `n` plus the contributions from each iteration.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the initial n and the contributions from each iteration)**
