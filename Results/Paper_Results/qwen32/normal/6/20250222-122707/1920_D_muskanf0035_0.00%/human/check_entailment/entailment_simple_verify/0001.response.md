### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, provided code, and annotations.

#### Problem Breakdown
1. **Array Operations:**
   - **Type 1:** Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
   - **Type 2:** Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. This means the array size will increase exponentially.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each query `k`, determine the `k`-th element of the final array, where elements are 1-indexed.

#### Key Points
- The array size can grow exponentially due to Type 2 operations, making it impractical to store the entire array explicitly.
- The problem requires handling up to `10^5` operations and queries across multiple test cases, implying that the solution must be efficient.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program

##### Function `func_1`:
- **Appending Values:**
  - When `op_type == 1`, the program correctly appends `value` to the array.
- **Extending the Array:**
  - When `op_type == 2`, the program attempts to extend the array by appending `x` copies of itself using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. However, this is incorrect because it only appends the array once, not `x` times. The correct approach would be to extend the array `x` times, which would result in the array being repeated `x` times.
- **Query Handling:**
  - The program calculates the `k`-th element using `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This works correctly if the array is built correctly, but due to the incorrect handling of Type 2 operations, the array size and content are incorrect.

##### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - Correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries.
- **Result Calculation:**
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `n`, `operations`, and `queries` are correctly defined.
- After processing operations, the final `array` is supposed to be the result of all operations, but it is incorrect due to the flawed handling of Type 2 operations.
- The `result` list is correctly computed based on the incorrect `array`.

#### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not handle Type 2 operations correctly. Specifically, when `op_type == 2`, the program should append `x` copies of the array to itself, but it only appends the array once. This results in an incorrect array size and content, leading to incorrect query results.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for handling Type 2 operations, resulting in incorrect array construction and, consequently, incorrect query results.
