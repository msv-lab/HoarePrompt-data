The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. This means the initial values of `n` and `q` (which were positive integers read from the input) are updated to the new values read by this line. The variables `operations`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer read from the input, `q` is the second positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
