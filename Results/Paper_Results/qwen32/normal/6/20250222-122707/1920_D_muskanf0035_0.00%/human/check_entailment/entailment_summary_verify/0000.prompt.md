You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:

        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of operations and queries. For each test case, it processes a series of operations and then answers a series of queries, outputting the results for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function incorrectly implements the second type of operation (appending `x` copies of the array to itself).

#### Problem in the Second Operation:
The second type of operation is described as appending `x` copies of the current array to itself. For example, if the current array is `[1, 2]` and the operation is `2 3`, the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (3 copies of `[1, 2]` appended to itself).

However, the current implementation of the second operation in `func_1` appends only one copy of the array to itself:
```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This line appends only one copy of the array to itself, not `x` copies.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the second type of operation, we need to append `x` copies of the array to itself. This can be done using a loop or by multiplying the list:
```python
else:
    array *= x
```
or
```python
else:
    array.extend(array * (x - 1))
```

#### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
1 1
2 3
1 2
1
```
The expected output is `1` because after the first operation, the array is `[1]`. After the second operation, it should be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (3 copies of `[1]`), but the current implementation makes it `[1, 1]`. After the third operation, the array becomes `[1, 1, 2]`. The query asks for the 1st element, which should be `1`.

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `2` because it only appends one copy of the array, resulting in `[1, 1, 2]` after the second operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the second type of operation, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
