Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, a list of integers representing indices. The function performs a series of operations on an array and returns a list of elements from the array selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around the array if necessary.**
