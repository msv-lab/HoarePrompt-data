t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. operations is a list of n tuples, where each tuple (b, x) represents an operation with b being either 1 or 2, and x being an integer such that if b=1 then 1 <= x <= n, and if b=2 then 1 <= x <= 10^9. queries is a list of q integers, each k_i satisfying 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the length of the array after all n operations. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.
