To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`, and assigns the return value of this function to the variable `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first positive integer read from the input.
- `q` is the second positive integer read from the input.
- `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input.
- `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `t` is 1.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The variable `result` is the only one that will be affected by this line of code, as it is assigned the return value of `func_1`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Since we do not have the definition or behavior of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value returned by it. However, we can state that `result` is now assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer read from the input, `q` is the second positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
