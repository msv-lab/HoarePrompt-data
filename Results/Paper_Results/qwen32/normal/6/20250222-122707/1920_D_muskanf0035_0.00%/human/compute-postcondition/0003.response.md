The given code snippet reads `n` operations from the input and stores them in the `operations` list. The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are positive integers read from the input, and `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` (either 1 or 2) and `x` (with specific constraints based on the value of `b`). The `queries` list and `t` variable are not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the `operations` list will be populated with the `n` operations read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, `t` must be greater than 0.**
