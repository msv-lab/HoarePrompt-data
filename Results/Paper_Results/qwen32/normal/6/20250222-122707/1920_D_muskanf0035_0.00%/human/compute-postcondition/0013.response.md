The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, so at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 (since it gets decremented by 1 at the end of the iteration).

State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
