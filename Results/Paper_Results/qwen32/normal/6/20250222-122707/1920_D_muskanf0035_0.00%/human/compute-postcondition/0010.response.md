The code snippet provided updates the `queries` list by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

In natural language: The `queries` list has been updated to a new list of integers read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
