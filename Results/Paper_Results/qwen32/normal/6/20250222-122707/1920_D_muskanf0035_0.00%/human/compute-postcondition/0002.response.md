The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q`. This means the initial values of `n` and `q` are overwritten with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, x ≥ 1 for b=2), `queries` is a list of q positive integers, `t` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state means that `n` and `q` have been updated to the values provided in the input, while the other variables (`operations`, `queries`, and `t`) remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
