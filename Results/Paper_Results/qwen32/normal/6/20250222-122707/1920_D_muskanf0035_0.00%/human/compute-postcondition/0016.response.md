The code snippet updates the `queries` list by reading a new list of integers from the input. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged. The new `queries` list will contain the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer read from the input, `q` is the second positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
