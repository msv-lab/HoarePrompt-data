The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not hold any state that needs to be preserved or adjusted, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0 and will be `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
