Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, and `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`.**

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, representing the sizes of the slimes. The integer `n` remains the same, representing the number of slimes. The new variable `left` is initialized as a list containing a single element, `0`.
