### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and how they fit the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function is supposed to find the position of a value `x` in a list `a` using binary search (`bisect_left`), and return the index + 1 if the exact value is found, or just the index if it's not found.
- However, the function has a logical flaw. The value `x` should be compared with the elements of `a` directly, not as an index. The current implementation will not correctly return the position of `x` in `a` when `x` is not an index but a value from `a`.
- For example, if `a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and `x = 5`, the function should return `3` (since 5 is at index 2, and we add 1). However, the function will treat `x` as an index and return the result of `bisect_left` on `a` with `x` as the index, which is incorrect.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
- It first constructs a `left` array, which is a prefix sum array of `a`.
- It also constructs a `last` array, which keeps track of the last index where the value changed.
- The main loop checks if the current slime can eat the previous slime directly (if `a[i] < a[i-1]`), otherwise, it calculates the index `inx` using `func_1`.
- The logic for calculating `inx` seems flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.
- The final answer `ans[i]` is calculated based on the index `inx` and the current index `i`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, which affects the correctness of `func_2`. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
