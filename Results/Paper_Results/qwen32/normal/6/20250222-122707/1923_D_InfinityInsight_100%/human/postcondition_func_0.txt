The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It returns -1 if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is a valid index in the list `a` and the element at index `x` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1`, where `inx` is the index of `x` in `a`. Otherwise, it returns `inx`, which is the value returned by `bl(a, x)`.
