The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `last`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 3`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. `i` is 3. `last` is a list containing the elements `[0, 3]`.**
