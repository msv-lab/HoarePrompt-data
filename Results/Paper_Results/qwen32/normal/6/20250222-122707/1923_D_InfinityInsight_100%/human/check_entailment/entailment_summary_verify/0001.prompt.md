You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that `n` equals the length of `a` and is at least 1. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is `1` if the size of the current slime is less than the size of the previous slime, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions within the loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program in the context of the problem description.

The task is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime or determine if it is impossible. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each with a list of slime sizes, and output the required results.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses `bisect_left` to find the position where `x` would be inserted in the sorted list `a` to maintain its order.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the 1-based index of `x`.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the 0-based index where `x` would be inserted.
   - If `x` is negative, it returns `-1`.

2. **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - `left` is a prefix sum array where `left[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - `last` is an array where `last[i]` holds the index of the last occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an array of `-1`s, which will store the results for each slime.
   - For each slime at index `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is smaller than `a[i-1]`, it can be eaten immediately, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the sum of elements up to index `i-1` minus `a[i]` and `1`.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the position where `x` would be inserted in the prefix sum array `left`.
     - It also considers the last occurrence of `a[i-1]` in `last`.
     - If `last[i-1]` is a valid index and smaller than the index found by `func_1`, it uses `last[i-1]`.
     - If a valid index is found, it calculates the number of seconds it takes to eat the slime and stores it in `ans[i]`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and their sizes `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2(a, n)` to compute the results for each slime in the test case.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the condition where a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly bigger.
- The use of prefix sums and binary search (via `bisect_left`) helps in efficiently determining the position where a slime can be eaten.
- However, there seems to be a logical flaw in the approach. The program does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where a slime might be eaten. For example, it does not consider the possibility of a slime being eaten by a neighbor that is not immediately adjacent but can eat it after some other slimes have been eaten.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly and may not provide accurate results for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
