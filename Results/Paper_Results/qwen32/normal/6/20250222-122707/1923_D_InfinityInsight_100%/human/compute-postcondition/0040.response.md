To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`, so the only variable we can adjust is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1.
- `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`.
- `last` is unchanged.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`.
- `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`.
- `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` is incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it clear:
State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was the loop variable at the end of the last iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more concrete, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
