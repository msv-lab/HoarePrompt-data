Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then the `i`-th element of `ans` is set to `1`.**
