Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is not equal to `a[1]`, then `last` is `[-1, 2, 2]`. Otherwise, `a[2]` is equal to `a[1]` and `last` is `[-1, -1, -1]`.**
