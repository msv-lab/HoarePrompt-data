### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given solution to determine its correctness.

1. **Cases Handled by the Solution:**
   - **k = n**: The solution outputs an array of `n` ones (`[1] * n`). This is correct because any array with identical elements will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
   - **k = 1**: The solution outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is correct because the array is sorted, and its cyclic shifts will not be sorted unless the shift is the original array.
   - **1 < k < n**: The solution outputs `[-1]`, indicating that no valid array exists. However, this is incorrect. There are valid arrays for some values of `k` in this range.

2. **Verification of the Cases:**
   - **k = n**: The array `[1] * n` will indeed have all its cyclic shifts sorted, so this is correct.
   - **k = 1**: The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and none of its cyclic shifts (other than itself) will be sorted, so this is correct.
   - **1 < k < n**: The solution incorrectly returns `[-1]`. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are:
     - `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted)
     - `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted)
     - `[1, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
     Here, exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts are sorted, which matches the requirement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly handles the cases where `k = n` and `k = 1`.
   - The solution incorrectly handles the cases where `1 < k < n` by returning `[-1]` when valid arrays do exist.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the solution is incorrect for the cases where `1 < k < n`.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**
