Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if its elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of an array involves moving some elements from the beginning of the array to the end.
3. **Objective**: For given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000`
   - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `1000`.

### Solution Analysis:
Let's break down the solution provided:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)
```

#### Cases Handled:
1. **k = n**: 
   - **Description**: All cyclic shifts need to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides an array of `n` ones (`[1] * n`).
   - **Reasoning**: Any array with identical elements (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`) will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
   - **Correctness**: True.

2. **k = 1**:
   - **Description**: Exactly one cyclic shift needs to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - **Reasoning**: The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is already sorted, and its cyclic shifts will not be sorted unless the shift is the original array.
   - **Correctness**: True.

3. **1 < k < n**:
   - **Description**: Between one and all cyclic shifts need to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides `[-1]`, indicating no valid array exists.
   - **Reasoning**: For `1 < k < n`, creating an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted is more complex and cannot be achieved with the simple patterns used for `k = 1` and `k = n`.
   - **Correctness**: False. The solution incorrectly returns `[-1]` for these cases. There are valid arrays for some values of `k` in this range.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly handles the cases where `k = n` and `k = 1` but incorrectly handles the cases where `1 < k < n`. Therefore, the overall correctness of the solution is False.

**Correctness: False**
