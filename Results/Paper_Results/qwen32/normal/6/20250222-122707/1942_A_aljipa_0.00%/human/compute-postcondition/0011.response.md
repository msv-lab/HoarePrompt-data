Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are the new integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer read from input. The values of `n` and `k` also remain the same as they are new integers read from the input. The variable `res` is updated based on the conditions provided:
- If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of 1s with length `n`.
- If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
- If neither condition is met, `res` becomes a list containing -1.
