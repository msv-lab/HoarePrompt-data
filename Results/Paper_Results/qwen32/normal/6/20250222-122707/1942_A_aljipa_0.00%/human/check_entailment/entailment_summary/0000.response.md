Reasoning:  
The provided program is supposed to generate an array based on the values of `n` and `k` according to the problem description. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the requirements:

1. **When `k == n`:** The program outputs an array of `n` ones. This is correct because if `k == n`, all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. An array of identical elements (like all ones) will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.

2. **When `k == 1`:** The program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is correct because if `k == 1`, only one cyclic shift should be sorted. The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is itself sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because they will start with a larger number than the end number of the previous shift.

3. **When `k` is neither `n` nor `1`:** The program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is neither `n` nor `1`. If there's more than one sorted cyclic shift but not all, there's no straightforward way to construct such an array with the given constraints.

Given these points, the program correctly handles all specified cases according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
