The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `numbers`. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, is not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `numbers` is now an empty list, while `t` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is an empty list.**
