The code assigns the value of `i` to `values[i]`. Given that `i` is initialized to 1, `values[1]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with `values[1]` set to 1 and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 1**
