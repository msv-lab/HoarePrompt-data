Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 45.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[12]` which is `3`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[i]` which is 69, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the integer value of the last digit of `word`, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with the last digit removed, `sum_total` is 69

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `values[11]` is 2, and `values[12]` is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[11]` which is 47 and `sum_values[i]` which is 69, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 47, `i` is 11.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `values[11]` is 2, and `values[12]` is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`, `sum_values[11]` is 47, and `sum_values[12]` is 50, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 12, `word` is the string "12", `last` is 2, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 50, `i` is 12`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
