Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), numbers is a list containing t elements, each element being an input integer, values is a list of length max(numbers) + 1 with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and all other elements initialized to 0 except values[10] which is 1, values[11] which is 2, and values[12] which is 3, sum_values is a list of length max(numbers) + 1 with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and all other elements initialized to 0, except sum_values[10] which is 46, sum_values[11] which is 48, and sum_values[12] which is 51, total is 45.
Code of the loop:
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be at least 1, `numbers` is a list containing at least one element, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[10]` which is 1, `values[11]` which is 2, and `values[12]` which is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[10]` which is 46, `sum_values[11]` which is 48, and `sum_values[12]` which is 51, `total` is 45

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `numbers` is a list containing at least one element, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[10]` which is 1, `values[11]` which is 2, and `values[12]` which is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[10]` which is 46, `sum_values[11]` which is 48, and `sum_values[12]` which is 51, `total` is 45, `n` is the next element in `numbers`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `numbers` is a list containing at least one element, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[10]` which is 1, `values[11]` which is 2, and `values[12]` which is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[10]` which is 46, `sum_values[11]` which is 48, and `sum_values[12]` which is 51, `total` is 45, `n` is the next element in `numbers`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
