The code snippet provided updates the value of `last` by extracting the last digit of the string `word`. Given `word` is "11", the last digit is '1'. Therefore, `last` is updated to 1.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[12]` which is `3`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[i]` which is 69, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with the last digit removed, `sum_total` is 69, `i` is 11.**
