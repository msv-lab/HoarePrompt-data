The code snippet provided initializes a variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0.**
