Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with `values[1]` set to 1, `values[2]` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0, `sum_values[1]` set to 1, and `sum_values[2]` set to 3, `total` is 3, `i` is 2.**

The value of `sum_values[i]` (which is `sum_values[2]`) is updated to the value of `total`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
