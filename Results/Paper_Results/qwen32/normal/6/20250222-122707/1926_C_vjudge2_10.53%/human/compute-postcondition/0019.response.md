The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop runs for `i` from 0 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than 10.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element initialized to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 1**
