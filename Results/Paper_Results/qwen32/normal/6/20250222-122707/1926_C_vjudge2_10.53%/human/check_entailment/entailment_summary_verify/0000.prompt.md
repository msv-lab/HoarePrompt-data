You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` and prints the sum of the values of all digits from 1 to `n`, where the value of a number is defined as the sum of the values of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. Specifically, the loop that calculates `values` and `sum_values` is only run up to `n`, which is the maximum value from the input test cases. This means that if a test case has a value of `n` that is smaller than the maximum `n` from the previous test cases, the program will not correctly compute the sum of digits for that `n` because the corresponding `values` and `sum_values` have not been updated for that particular `n`.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
12
15
```
The program will correctly compute the sum of digits for `n=12` but will incorrectly compute it for `n=15` because it only computes up to the maximum `n` from the input test cases (which is 15 in this case), but it does not recompute `values` and `sum_values` for each individual test case.

The loop should be inside the test case processing loop to ensure that `values` and `sum_values` are computed correctly for each `n` in each test case. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        values = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        sum_values = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        total = 0
        for i in range(10):
            values[i] = i
            total += i
            sum_values[i] = total
        for i in range(10, n + 1):
            word = str(i)
            last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
            remainder = int(word[:-1])
            values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
            sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
            sum_values[i] = sum_total
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that `values` and `sum_values` are computed for each `n` in each test case, thus handling all potential cases correctly.
