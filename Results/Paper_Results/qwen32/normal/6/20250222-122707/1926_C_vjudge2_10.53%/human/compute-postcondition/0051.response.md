To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum_values[n])` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `n` is used. However, the initial state does not explicitly define the value of `n`. Therefore, we need to infer what `n` could be based on the information provided.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list containing at least one element.
- `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1`, with specific values for the first 14 elements.
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1`, with specific cumulative sums for the first 14 elements.
- `total` is 45.

Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, let's consider a plausible scenario. Typically, `n` would be an element from the `numbers` list or could be derived from some operation on `numbers`. However, without a specific definition, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

The `sum_values` list is defined as follows:
- `sum_values[0]` to `sum_values[9]` are cumulative sums of integers from 0 to 9.
- `sum_values[10]` is 46.
- `sum_values[11]` is 48.
- `sum_values[12]` is 51.

Given the structure of `sum_values`, the printed value will depend on the value of `n`. If `n` is an element from `numbers` and `numbers` contains values between 0 and 12, then `sum_values[n]` will be one of the predefined values in `sum_values`.

Let's assume `n` is an element from the `numbers` list and `numbers` contains values that are valid indices for `sum_values`. For example, if `n` is 5, then `sum_values[5]` will be 15.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is an element from the numbers list and sum_values[n] is the cumulative sum up to n as defined in the initial state)**

If we assume `n` to be a specific value for demonstration, let's say `n` is 10:
Output: **46**

However, without the exact value of `n`, the most precise description is:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is an element from the numbers list and sum_values[n] is the cumulative sum up to n as defined in the initial state)**
