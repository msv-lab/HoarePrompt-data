Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if the length of `win` was less than `k` before the if statement, otherwise `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` is 0; `i` is an element of `us`.**
