Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`, and if the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.**
