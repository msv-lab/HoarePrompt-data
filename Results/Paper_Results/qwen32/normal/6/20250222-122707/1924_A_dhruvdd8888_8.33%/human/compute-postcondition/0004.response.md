The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `ans`. The initial values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, and `win`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
