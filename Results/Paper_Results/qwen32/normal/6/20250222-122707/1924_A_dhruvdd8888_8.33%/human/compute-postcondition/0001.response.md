Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6; `s` is updated to the string read from the input.**

Natural Language: The variable `s` is updated to the string read from the input, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
