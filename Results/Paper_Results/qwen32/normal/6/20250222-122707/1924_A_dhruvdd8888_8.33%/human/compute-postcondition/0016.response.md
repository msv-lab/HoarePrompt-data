The code snippet `win.add(i)` adds the current character `i` to the set `win`. Given the initial state, `win` can either be empty or contain some elements (up to `k-1` elements). After adding `i`, if the length of `win` becomes `k`, `ans` will be updated to contain the character `i`, and `ps` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` and `ps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` is 0; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
