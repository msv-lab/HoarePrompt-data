Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
2. `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000.
3. `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
4. `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element.
5. `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`. If the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`.
6. `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
7. `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
8. `i` is the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. `''.join(ans)`: This concatenates all the characters in the list `ans` into a single string. The list `ans` contains characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
2. `i`: This is the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`. Since `us` contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` will be one of these characters.
3. `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`: This creates a string of 'a's with a length of `n - len(ans) - 1`. This ensures that the total length of the final string is `n`.

### Output Explanation:
The output will be a string formed by:
- The characters in `ans` concatenated together.
- Followed by the character `i`.
- Followed by a number of 'a's such that the total length of the string is `n`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a string of length `n` where the first part is the characters in `ans`, the next character is `i`, and the rest are 'a's.

Output: **the concatenated characters in `ans` followed by `i` and then 'a's to make the total length `n`**
