Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[1, 0]` with `cnt[0]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0 if `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, and the current value of `c` is 0.**

In simple terms: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, it remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
