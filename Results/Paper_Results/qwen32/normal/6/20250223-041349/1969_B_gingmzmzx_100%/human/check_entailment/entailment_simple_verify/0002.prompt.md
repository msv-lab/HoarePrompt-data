You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substrings. The cost of shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads a binary string `s`.
2. It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
3. It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
4. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
5. It iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is a zero, it adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one one encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the character is a one, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.
6. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:
Let's consider the logic behind the program:
- The cost calculation seems to be based on the idea that each zero that comes after a one needs to be moved past that one to sort the string.
- When a zero is encountered after a one (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to the cost because this zero needs to be moved to the left of the ones encountered so far.
- When a one is encountered, the cost is increased by the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) because each of these zeroes needs to be moved past this one.

This logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost should be the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of elements being moved past each other. The provided program does not calculate the cost of cyclic shifts correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
