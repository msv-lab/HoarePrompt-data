The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not influence the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed some number of times, and `n` was the original number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred. Since the loop variable `_` is not affecting the state, we don't need to modify it.

State: **`cnt` reflects the total count of `0`s and `1`s, `ans` is the sum of specific counts as described, and `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.**
