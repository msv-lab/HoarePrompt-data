Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operation.

The logic in the program seems incorrect because it does not properly account for the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The program simply counts the number of transitions from 1 to 0 and adds the cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.

Let's consider an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We can choose the substring [1, 3] (i.e., the entire string) and perform a cyclic shift: `101 -> 110`. The cost of this operation is 3.
- Then, we can choose the substring [1, 2] (i.e., the first two characters) and perform a cyclic shift: `110 -> 011`. The cost of this operation is 2.
- The total cost is 3 + 2 - 3 = 2 (we can do it in a single operation by shifting the entire string `101 -> 011`).

However, the provided code will output `1` for this input, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least this case, and the Correctness is **False**.
