Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 1 based on the value of `c`, `ans` is `0`, `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element, `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`, and `c` is not equal to 0**
