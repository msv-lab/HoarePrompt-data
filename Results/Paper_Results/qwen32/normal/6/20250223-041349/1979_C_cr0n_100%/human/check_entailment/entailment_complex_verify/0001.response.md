### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its annotations to verify if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across multiple outcomes such that if any one of the outcomes wins, the total amount received back is strictly greater than the total amount bet. Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i` which indicates how many times the bet on that outcome will be returned if it wins.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that the function returns the least common multiple (LCM) of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - **Calculating LCM**:
     - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_1`.
     - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence.
   - **Calculating `vprod`**:
     - It then calculates `vprod`, which is essentially the LCM divided by each multiplier. This gives a set of numbers that, when multiplied by their respective multipliers, will sum up to the LCM.
     - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - **Checking Validity**:
     - It checks if the LCM minus the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
     - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that if `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program prints `-1`.
     - **Logic**: The logic here is flawed. The condition `den = den - sum(vprod)` is intended to check if there's a surplus after distributing the bets according to `vprod`. However, `den` is the LCM, and `sum(vprod)` is the sum of the LCM divided by each multiplier, which should equal the LCM itself. Therefore, `den - sum(vprod)` will always be zero, not a surplus. This means the condition `den <= 0` will always be true, and the program will incorrectly print `-1` for all cases.

### Correctness Check

- The logic of the program is flawed because the condition `den <= 0` will always be true due to the way `den` and `vprod` are calculated.
- The program does not correctly identify when a valid distribution is possible.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
