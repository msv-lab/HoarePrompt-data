### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by determining a set of bets (`x_i`) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers (`vals`).

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers in `vals` using the `func_1` function. This LCM (`den`) is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is less than the amount received for each outcome.

3. **Betting Distribution**:
   - The program calculates a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`. This essentially distributes the total amount (`den`) across the outcomes in a way that is proportional to the multipliers.
   - It then adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`. If `den` becomes less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.
   - If `den` is greater than 0, it prints the list `vprod` as the bets.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each outcome because `den` is initially the LCM of all multipliers, and `vprod` distributes this amount in a way that respects the multipliers.
   - If the sum of `vprod` exceeds or equals `den`, it correctly identifies that a valid distribution is not possible and outputs `-1`.
   - The constraints (`1 <= n <= 50` and `2 <= k_i <= 20`) ensure that the calculations remain feasible within the limits of integer operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets based on the given problem statement and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
