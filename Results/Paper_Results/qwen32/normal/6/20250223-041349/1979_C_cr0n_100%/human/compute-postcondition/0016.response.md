To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the problem and understand the values of the variables involved based on the initial state.

1. **N**: This is an integer value provided by the input, and it is in the range 1 to 50 inclusive.
2. **vals**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input, and each integer in the list is between 2 and 20 inclusive.
3. **den**: This is calculated by applying the function `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence and then subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
4. **vprod**: This is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. Since `den` is divided by each element in `vals`, each element in `vprod` is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

This statement converts each element in the list `vprod` to a string and then joins them with a space. The final output is a single string containing the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

Given the precondition, let's denote the elements of `vals` as `vals[0], vals[1], ..., vals[N-1]`. The value of `den` is determined by the function `func_1` and the sum of `vprod`, but the exact value of `den` is not specified. However, we know that `den` is greater than 0.

The elements of `vprod` are calculated as:
\[ vprod[i] = \frac{den}{vals[i]} \]
for each \( i \) from 0 to \( N-1 \).

Since `den` is greater than 0 and each element in `vals` is between 2 and 20, each element in `vprod` will be an integer (resulting from integer division).

The output will be a space-separated string of these integers.

Given the lack of specific values for `N`, `vals`, and `den`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[N-1]] (where vprod[i] is the integer division of den by vals[i])**
