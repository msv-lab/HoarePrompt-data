Postcondition: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence, minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
