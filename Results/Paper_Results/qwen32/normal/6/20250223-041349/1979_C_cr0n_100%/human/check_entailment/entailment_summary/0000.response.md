### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome.
- Each outcome `i` has a multiplier `k_i`.
- The total amount of coins bet must be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - This is a standard and correct way to compute the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Reading**: It reads `N` and a list of multipliers `vals`.
   - **Denominator Calculation**: It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
   - **vprod Calculation**: It creates a list `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This essentially computes the contribution of each multiplier to the total denominator.
   - **Final Denominator Adjustment**: It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den` to get the remaining coins to bet.
   - **Output**: If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, it means there's no way to distribute the coins as required, so it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

#### Verification:
- The approach leverages the LCM to ensure that the total bet is less than the coins received for any winning outcome.
- The key idea is that if `den` is the LCM of all multipliers, then `den // k_i` gives a value such that `k_i * (den // k_i)` is exactly `den` for each `k_i`. By distributing `den // k_i` coins on each outcome, the total bet is `den`, and the coins received for any winning outcome `i` would be `k_i * (den // k_i) = den`, which is exactly equal to the total bet, not strictly greater.
- The adjustment by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem. The use of LCM and the subsequent adjustments ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome.

### Correctness: **True**
