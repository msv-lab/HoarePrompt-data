Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across multiple outcomes in such a way that if any one of the outcomes wins, the total amount received back is strictly greater than the total amount bet. Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i` which indicates how many times the bet on that outcome will be returned if it wins.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`. 
   - This is used to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the bets in such a way that the conditions of the problem are met.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates `vprod`, which is essentially the LCM divided by each multiplier. This gives a set of numbers that, when multiplied by their respective multipliers, will sum up to the LCM.
   - It checks if the LCM minus the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If a valid distribution is possible, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets.

### Key Points to Consider

- The program aims to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- The LCM of the multipliers is used to ensure that the distribution is valid across all outcomes.
- The condition `den = den - sum(vprod)` checks if there is a surplus after distributing the bets according to `vprod`. If there isn't, it means the distribution isn't valid.

### Correctness Check

The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description. By using the LCM of the multipliers, the program ensures that for any winning outcome, the amount received will be strictly greater than the total amount bet. The check `den <= 0` correctly identifies when a valid distribution is not possible.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
