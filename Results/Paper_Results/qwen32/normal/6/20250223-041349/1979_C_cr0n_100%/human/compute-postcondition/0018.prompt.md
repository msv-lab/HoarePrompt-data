You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes (1 <= N <= 50), vals is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals).
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); vals is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; den is the result of applying func_1 successively to all elements of vals in sequence.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence, minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`; `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[N-1]] (where vprod[i] is the integer division of den by vals[i])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `N`, an integer representing the number of outcomes (where 1 <= N <= 50), and `vals`, a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (where each multiplier k_i in `vals` satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20). The function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
