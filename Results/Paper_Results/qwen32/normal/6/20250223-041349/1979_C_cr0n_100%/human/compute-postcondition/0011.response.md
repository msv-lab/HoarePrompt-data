The code snippet modifies the value of `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from it. The values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, and `vprod` are provided in the initial state, and only `den` is affected by the execution of the code.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence, minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**
