The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `vals`.

Initial State: `N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals).

The code:
```
vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
```
This line of code will update the `vals` list with integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `N` remains unchanged. The `vals` list is now populated with integers parsed from the input, where each integer is guaranteed to be between 2 and 20 inclusive.
