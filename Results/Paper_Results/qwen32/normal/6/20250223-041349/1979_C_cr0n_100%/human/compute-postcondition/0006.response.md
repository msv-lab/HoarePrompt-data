To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the line `den = func_1(den, x)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided initial state or examples, we cannot compute the exact new value of `den`. However, we can describe the state after the function is called.

Given:
- `N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50).
- `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive and must have at least one more element.
- `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`.
- `x` is the next element in `vals`.

The line `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` based on the function `func_1` with the current `den` and `x` as arguments.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we can only say that `den` will be updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive and must have at least one more element; `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`; `x` is the next element in `vals`.**
