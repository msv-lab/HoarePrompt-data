Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`; If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. If `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` was originally 1 and is now 2. If `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie', `ans` was originally 0 and is now 1. The values of `num_iterations`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`.
