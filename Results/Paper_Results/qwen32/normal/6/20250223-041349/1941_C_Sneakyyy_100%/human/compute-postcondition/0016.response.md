The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` could either be 0 or 1. After the increment, `ans` will be either 1 or 2, respectively.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 5; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`; If `s` was originally 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4.**
