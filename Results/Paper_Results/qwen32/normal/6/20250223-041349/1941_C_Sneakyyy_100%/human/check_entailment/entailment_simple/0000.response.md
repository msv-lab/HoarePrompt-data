### Reasoning:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful, where a string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided program iterates through each test case, and for each string, it scans through the string looking for occurrences of "pie" or "map". If such a substring is found, it increments the answer by 1 and skips the next two characters (as they are part of the substring that needs to be removed). If no such substring is found, it simply moves to the next character.

However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made. For example, consider the string "mapie". The current approach would count this as two deletions (one for "map" and one for "pie"), but it can actually be made beautiful with just one deletion (removing the 'a' in "map" or the 'm' in "pie").

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method to ensure that the minimum deletions are counted, possibly using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that keeps track of overlapping substrings.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not always compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
