The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Therefore, if `ans` was originally 2, it will now be 3. If `ans` was originally 0, it will now be 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than or equal to 8; if `i` was originally 6, `s` is now `a[6:9]` and `ans` is 3, `i` is now 9; if `i` was originally 2, `s` is now `a[2:5]` and `ans` is 1, `i` is now 5.**
