The code snippet `p = [0] * n` changes the list `p` to a new list containing `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is the original `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
