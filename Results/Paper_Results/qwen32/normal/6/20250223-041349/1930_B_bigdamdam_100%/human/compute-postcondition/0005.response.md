The code snippet provided is `p[i] = ind`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, we can't determine which element of the list `p` will be updated. Therefore, we assume `i` is a valid index for the list `p` (i.e., `0 <= i < n`).

Given that `ind` is equal to `n` and `p` is a list of `n` zeros, after the execution of the code, the `i`-th element of `p` will be set to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with the `i`-th element set to `n`, `ind` is equal to `n`.**
