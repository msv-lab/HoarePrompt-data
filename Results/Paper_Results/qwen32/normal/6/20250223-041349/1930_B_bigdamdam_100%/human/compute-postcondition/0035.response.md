The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than `i + 2` as this condition is not affected by the operation on `ind`. The value of `p[i]` is now `ind - 2` since `ind` has been decremented by 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `p[i]` is `ind - 2`**.
