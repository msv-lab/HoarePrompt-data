Let's break down the given code step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The input file must contain at least three lines.
   - The third line (index 2) is a valid line containing integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```
   - `line` is expected to be the third line of the input file, which contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - `tokens := line.split()` is an assignment expression (walrus operator) where `tokens` is assigned the result of `line.split()`. This splits the line into a list of substrings based on whitespace.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of elements in the list `tokens`.
   - `{*tokens}` converts the list `tokens` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique elements in the list `tokens`.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate elements in the list `tokens`.

3. **Output Explanation**:
   - The print statement will output the number of duplicate elements in the third line of the input file.

Given the initial state, the output will be the count of duplicate integers in the third line of the input file.

Output: **number of duplicate integers in the third line of the input file**
