To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the code and analyze it step by step based on the provided initial state.

### Code Breakdown:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable Assignment and Tokenization**:
   - `line.split()` splits the string contained in `line` into a list of words (tokens) based on whitespace.
   - The `:=` operator (walrus operator) assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens`.

2. **Length Calculation**:
   - `len(tokens)` calculates the number of tokens in the list `tokens`.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list `tokens`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate tokens are removed.
   - `len({*tokens})` calculates the number of unique tokens in the set.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

### Final Print Statement:
- The `print` statement outputs the result of the subtraction, which is the count of duplicate tokens in the `line`.

### Given Information:
- The initial state specifies that the seventh line of the input file (index 6) is a valid line. This means `line` contains the string from the seventh line of the input file.

### Output Description:
- Since the exact content of the seventh line is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the structure of the problem.

### Final Answer:
The `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the seventh line of the input file.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the seventh line of the input file**
