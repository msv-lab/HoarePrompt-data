### Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the total number of card integers and the number of unique card integers for each test case. This calculation does not provide the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally.

The problem requires an optimal strategy to maximize your points, taking into account Nene's optimal play. Here's a breakdown of what the program should do:

1. **Understand the Game Dynamics:**
   - You and Nene take turns.
   - You get a point if the card number you play is already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - You should play a card that has a pair already on the table if possible, to maximize your points.
   - If no pair is available on the table, you should play a card that minimizes Nene's future opportunities to score points.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - Track the cards on the table.
   - Simulate the game turns, ensuring you play optimally and Nene plays optimally against you.

The given program does not simulate the game or account for the strategic decisions required by both players. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards, which does not reflect the game's rules or the required optimal play.
