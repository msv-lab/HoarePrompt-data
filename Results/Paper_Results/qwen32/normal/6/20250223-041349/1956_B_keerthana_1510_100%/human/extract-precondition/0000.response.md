Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
