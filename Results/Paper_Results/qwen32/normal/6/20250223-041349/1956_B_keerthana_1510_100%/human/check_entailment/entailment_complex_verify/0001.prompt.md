You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards and a list of integers on those cards. It calculates and prints the difference between the total number of card integers and the number of unique card integers for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem involves a card game where each player has `n` cards, each card has a number from 1 to `n`, and each number appears exactly twice in the deck. Players take turns playing cards, and a player scores a point if the card they play has already been played by either player. The goal is to maximize your score, assuming Nene (the opponent) plays optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Optimal Play by Nene:** Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple optimal moves, she minimizes your score.
2. **Objective:** Determine the maximum score you can achieve if you play optimally.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. Instead, it performs a simple operation on the input:

```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

Here's what the program does:

1. It reads the input lines starting from the third line (skipping the first two lines, which are the number of test cases and the value of `n` for the first test case).
2. For each line (which represents the cards in your hand for each test case), it calculates the difference between the number of cards (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique cards (`len({*tokens})`).
3. It prints this difference for each test case.

### Why the Program is Incorrect

The difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards does not provide the maximum score you can achieve. It simply counts how many duplicate cards you have. This does not account for the strategic play required to maximize your score against Nene's optimal play.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Count the Occurrences:** Count how many times each card number appears in your hand.
2. **Simulate the Game:** Simulate the game turns, taking into account that Nene plays optimally.
3. **Maximize Your Score:** Determine the best moves for you to maximize your score, considering Nene's optimal responses.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. It only calculates a simple difference that does not relate to the game's outcome.
