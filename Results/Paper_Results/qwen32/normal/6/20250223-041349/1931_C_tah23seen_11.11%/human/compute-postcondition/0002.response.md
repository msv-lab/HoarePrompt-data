To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= j`. Given the initial states:

- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i <= j` must be true. This means that `0 <= len(arr) - 1` must hold true. 

Let's break this down:

- If `arr` is an empty list, `len(arr)` would be 0, making `j` equal to `-1`. In this case, `0 <= -1` would be false, and the loop would not execute.
- To ensure the loop executes, `len(arr)` must be at least 1, making `j` equal to `0`. In this case, `0 <= 0` would be true, and the loop would execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
