Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array is a palindrome and handling specific cases where the array is not a palindrome. However, the logic in the function is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly for all cases.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function first tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal (i.e., the longest palindrome from both ends). If the entire array is a palindrome, it returns 0, which is correct.

2. If the array is not a palindrome, the function then checks if the mismatch is at the end of the array. If so, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the length of the segment that needs to be changed. However, this logic is flawed because it assumes that the mismatch is only at the end, which is not always the case.

3. If the mismatch is not at the end, the function returns `j - i`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal using the given operation.

The function does not correctly handle cases where the mismatch is in the middle of the array or where multiple segments need to be changed to make the array uniform. The optimal solution involves finding the most frequent element in the array and calculating the minimum cost to change all elements to that most frequent element.

Given the provided test cases and the logic in `func_1`, it is clear that the function does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
