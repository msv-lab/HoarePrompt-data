The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` still holds true but now it refers to the new value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `i` is increased by 1**.
