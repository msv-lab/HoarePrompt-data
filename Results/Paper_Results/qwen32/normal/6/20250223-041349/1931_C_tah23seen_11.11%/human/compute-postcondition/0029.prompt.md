Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is equal to `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
Code of the loop:
while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `i` is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `i` is increased by 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `arr[i + 2]` is equal to `arr[i + 3]`; `i` is increased by 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
