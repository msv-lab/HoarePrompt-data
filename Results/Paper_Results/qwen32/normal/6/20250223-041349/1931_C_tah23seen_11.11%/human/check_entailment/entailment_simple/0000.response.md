### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation where a subarray is set to a single value `x`. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

Let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` at the beginning of the array and `j` at the end of the array.
2. **Symmetric Comparison**: It then enters a loop where it checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves `i` forward and `j` backward. This loop continues until `i` and `j` either meet or cross each other.
3. **Early Termination**: If `i` crosses `j`, it means the entire array is symmetric, and all elements are the same. In this case, it returns 0 because no operation is needed.
4. **Finding the First Mismatch**: If the loop breaks because `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` are not equal, it then checks if the elements starting from `i` are all the same until the first mismatch.
5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `j` is not at the end of the array, it calculates the cost as `j - i + 1` because it can make all elements from `i` to `j` equal in one operation.
   - If `j` is at the end of the array, it calculates the cost as `j - i`, which is the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

However, the logic in the function is flawed. Specifically, the cost calculation part is incorrect. Here are the issues:

- After the first loop, `i` and `j` point to the first mismatch from the ends. The function then checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and increments `i` until a mismatch is found. This part is fine.
- The cost calculation should consider the minimum cost to make the entire array equal by either:
  - Changing the elements from `0` to `j` (cost `j + 1`).
  - Changing the elements from `i` to `n-1` (cost `n - i`).
  - Changing the elements from `i` to `j` (cost `j - i + 1`).

The current implementation does not consider these cases correctly and can return incorrect results.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`:

- The first loop will stop at `i = 0` and `j = 5` because `arr[0] != arr[5]`.
- The second loop will stop at `i = 0` because `arr[0] == arr[1]` is false.
- The function will then return `j - i + 1 = 5 - 0 + 1 = 6`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4 (changing elements from index 1 to 4 to 1).

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
