To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is satisfied. The only variables in the loop head are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, so we can only adjust those.

Given the state right before the loop:
- The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is equal to `j`.
- If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even.
- If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ.
- Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- Ensure that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
