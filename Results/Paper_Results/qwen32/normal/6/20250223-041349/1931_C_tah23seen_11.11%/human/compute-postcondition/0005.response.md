Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 1; `j` is `len(arr) - 2`. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the current value of `arr[j]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, so `j` now points to the second last element in the list `arr`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and the condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]` remain unchanged except for the new position of `j`.
