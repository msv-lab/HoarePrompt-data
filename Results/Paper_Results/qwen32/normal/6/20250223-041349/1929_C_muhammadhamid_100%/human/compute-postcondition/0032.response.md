The given initial state does not provide the value of the variable `a`. However, the `print` statement contains a conditional expression that evaluates whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is explicitly given as 63, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `a`.

Given:
- `input` is 12 (though this variable is not used in the provided print statement)
- `s` is 63

The `print` statement is:
```
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

Since the value of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine whether `a` is greater than or equal to 63. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If `a` is greater than or equal to 63, the output will be 'Yes'.
- If `a` is less than 63, the output will be 'No'.

Without the specific value of `a`, the output can be either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether `a` meets the condition `a >= 63`.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= 63 else 'No' (where a is the value of variable a)**
