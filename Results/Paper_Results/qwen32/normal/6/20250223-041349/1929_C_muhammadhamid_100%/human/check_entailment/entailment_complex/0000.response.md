### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any `n` by placing bets according to the rules of the casino. The key aspect of the problem is whether Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` consecutive bets and still be able to increase his coin count indefinitely.

The logic in the program calculates a minimum required starting amount `s` of coins that Sasha needs to ensure he can keep increasing his coins even after losing up to `x` consecutive bets. The calculation for `s` is based on the idea that after each loss, Sasha needs to be able to place a bet that can recover his losses and still allow him to increase his coins on subsequent wins.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to 1. This represents the smallest possible bet Sasha can make.
2. **Loop through possible losses**: For each of the `x` consecutive losses, the program updates `s` to account for the loss and the need to recover. The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the new `s` value. This formula ensures that after losing `i` times in a row, Sasha still has enough coins to place a bet that can recover his losses and increase his coins on the next win.
3. **Comparison**: After calculating the required `s`, the program checks if Sasha's initial amount `a` is at least `s`. If it is, Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any `n`; otherwise, he cannot.

The program correctly implements this logic for each test case and prints "Yes" or "No" based on whether Sasha's initial amount `a` meets the calculated requirement `s`.

### Correctness:
Based on the provided reasoning and the logic of the program, the program is correct for the problem statement.
