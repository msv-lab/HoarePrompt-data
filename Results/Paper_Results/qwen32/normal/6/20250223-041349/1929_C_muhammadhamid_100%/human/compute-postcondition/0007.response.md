The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

Given the constraints, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is currently 2 and will be incremented to 3).

State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input with the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `s` is 4 + (3 / (k - 1)); `i` is 3**
