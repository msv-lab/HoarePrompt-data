Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function returns "Alice" if `a` is greater than `b`, "Bob" if `b` is greater than `a`, and "Tie" if `a` is equal to `b`.**
