The given initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`) but these variables are not utilized in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States:**
   - `T`: The number of test cases (integer between 1 and 1000).
   - `i`: Set to 1 (integer).
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.

2. **Analyze the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('Bob')`.
   - This statement does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a literal string `'Bob'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Bob**
