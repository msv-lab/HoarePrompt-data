Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` and `b` retain their original values unless `a` is not equal to 1 and `b` is not equal to 1, in which case the parity of `a` remains unchanged, and if `a` was greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is not greater than `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `a` == `b`, the behavior is as described in the if part. If `a` == 1, or if `b` == 1, or if `b` != 1 and `a` is odd, or if `b` != 1 and `a` is even and `b` is odd, the behavior is also as described in the if part. In all other cases, the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `a` equals `b`, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` does not equal `b`, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b` if `a` equals 1 or if `b` equals 1. If `a` does not equal `b` and `a` is odd, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` does not equal `b`, `a` is even, and `b` is odd, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a > b` is true if `a` is greater than `b`, and false otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
