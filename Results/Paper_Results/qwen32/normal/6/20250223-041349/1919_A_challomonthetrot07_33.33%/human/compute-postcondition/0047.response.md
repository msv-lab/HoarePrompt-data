The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Information**:
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 to 1000.
   - `i` is set to the integer value 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integers that are read from the input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('Bob')` statement is executed.
   - This statement directly prints the string `'Bob'` to the output.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, the output is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
