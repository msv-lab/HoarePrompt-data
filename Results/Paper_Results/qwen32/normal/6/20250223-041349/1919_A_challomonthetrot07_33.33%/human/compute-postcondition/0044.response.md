The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, and `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers provided in the input, while `T` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 1000; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
