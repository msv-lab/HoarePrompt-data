The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bob'. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `T` represents the number of test cases and is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and they are equal to each other.

Despite the described initial state, the `print` statement only outputs the string 'Bob' and does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Bob**
