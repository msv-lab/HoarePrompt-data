The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will output the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Bob**
