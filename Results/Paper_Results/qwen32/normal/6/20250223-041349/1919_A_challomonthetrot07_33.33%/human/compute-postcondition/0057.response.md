Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 1000; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `a` equals `b`, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` does not equal `b`, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b` if `a` equals 1 or if `b` equals 1. If `a` does not equal `b` and `a` is odd, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` does not equal `b`, `a` is even, and `b` is odd, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a > b` is true if `a` is greater than `b`, and false otherwise.**
