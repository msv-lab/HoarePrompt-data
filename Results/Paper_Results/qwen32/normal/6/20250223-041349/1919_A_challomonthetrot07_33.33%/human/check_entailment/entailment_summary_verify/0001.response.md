Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap

- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
- Each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- The player then removes 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Equal Coins (a == b):**
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to make the last move when both wallets are empty.

2. **One Coin (a == 1 or b == 1):**
   - If `a == 1`, Alice loses because Bob can always take his coin, leaving Alice with no coins.
   - If `b == 1`, Alice wins because she can swap wallets and take her coin, leaving Bob with no coins.

3. **Odd vs Even Coins:**
   - If `a` is odd, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to make the last move when both wallets are empty.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins because Bob will be forced into a position where he has to make the last move.

4. **General Case (a > b or a < b):**
   - If `a > b` and `a` is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
   - If `a < b` and `a` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the logic in the provided program:

1. **Equal Coins (a == b):**
   - The program correctly returns 'Bob' when `a == b`.

2. **One Coin (a == 1 or b == 1):**
   - The program correctly returns 'Alice' when `a == 1` and 'Bob' when `b == 1`.

3. **Odd vs Even Coins:**
   - The program correctly returns 'Bob' when `a % 2 == 1` (Alice has an odd number of coins).
   - The program correctly returns 'Alice' when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` (Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number).

4. **General Case (a > b or a < b):**
   - The program incorrectly returns 'Bob' when `a > b`. This is not always correct. If `a` is even, Alice should win.
   - The program incorrectly returns 'Alice' when `a < b`. This is not always correct. If `a` is even, Bob should win.

### Conclusion

The program contains logical errors in handling the general cases where `a > b` and `a < b`. Specifically:

- When `a > b` and `a` is even, the program should return 'Alice' instead of 'Bob'.
- When `a < b` and `a` is even, the program should return 'Bob' instead of 'Alice'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
