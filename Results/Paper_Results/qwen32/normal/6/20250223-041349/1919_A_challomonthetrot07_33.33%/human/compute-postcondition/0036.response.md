Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
