The provided initial state includes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'Bob'.

Let's break it down:

- **Variables and Conditions:**
  - `T`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
  - `i`: An integer initialized to 0.
  - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input, with the conditions \(a \neq b\), \(a \neq 1\), \(b \neq 1\), and \(a\) being an odd integer.

- **Print Statement:**
  - `print('Bob')`: This statement will print the string 'Bob' regardless of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.

Since the print statement is independent of the initial state variables, the output will simply be 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
