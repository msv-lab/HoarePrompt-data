The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `T`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `i` is the loop counter and `T` is the total number of iterations, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's continuation since they are not part of the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` and `b` retain their original values unless `a` is not equal to 1 and `b` is not equal to 1, in which case the parity of `a` remains unchanged, and if `a` was greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is not greater than `b`.**
