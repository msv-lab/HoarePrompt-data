To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and the condition provided in the initial state.

1. **Variables:**
   - `neg`: This is the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.
   - `n`: This is the length of the string `s`.
   - `s`: This is the initial string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`.
   - This is a conditional expression that evaluates to `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it evaluates to `n`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** `n != neg`
  - In this case, the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
  - This means the output will be the length of the string `s` minus twice the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.

- **Scenario 2:** `n == neg`
  - In this case, the expression evaluates to `n`.
  - This means the output will be the length of the string `s` if all characters in the string are `'-'`.

**Output Description:**
- If the length of the string `s` is not equal to the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`, the output will be the length of the string `s` minus twice the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.
- If the length of the string `s` is equal to the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`, the output will be the length of the string `s`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
