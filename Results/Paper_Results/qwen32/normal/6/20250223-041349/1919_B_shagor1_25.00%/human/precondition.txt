The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), representing the length of the string s. The next line contains the string s, which consists of n characters, each of which is either '+' or '-'. The number of test cases, t, is given at the very beginning (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.
