The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", the current character `i` is '-', and `neg` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", the current character `i` is '-', `neg` is incremented by 1.**
