The code snippet increments the variable `neg` by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `neg` is incremented by 1.**
