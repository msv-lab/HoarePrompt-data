Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be attempting to count the number of '-' characters and using that to calculate a penalty, but this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to consider how to optimally split the array so that the sum of penalties for each subarray is minimized. This likely involves a more complex algorithm than simply counting the '-' characters.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Traverse the string `s` and compute the running sum.
2. Whenever the running sum returns to zero, it indicates that the subarray from the last zero-sum point to the current point can be split off with zero penalty.
3. Keep track of the total penalty by considering the absolute value of the running sum and the length of the subarray when the running sum does not return to zero.

The provided program does not implement this logic, hence it is incorrect.
