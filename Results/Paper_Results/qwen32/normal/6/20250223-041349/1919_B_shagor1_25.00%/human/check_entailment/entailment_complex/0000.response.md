Reasoning:
The provided code snippet does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays, calculating the penalty for each subarray, and summing these penalties.

The current implementation of `func_1` only counts the number of '-' characters in the string and then computes `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it computes `n`. This formula does not correspond to the penalty calculation described in the problem statement. The formula `n - 2 * neg` seems to be an incorrect attempt to compute the penalty, and it does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement an algorithm that finds an optimal way to split the array into subarrays and calculates the penalties accordingly. One possible approach is dynamic programming, where we keep track of the minimum penalty for each prefix of the array.

Given the incorrect implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **False**
