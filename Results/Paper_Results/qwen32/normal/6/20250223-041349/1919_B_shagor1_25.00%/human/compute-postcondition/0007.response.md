The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the string `s`. Since `s` is a constant string that does not change during the loop iterations, we only need to adjust the variable `i` to point to the next character in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was pointing to a character in the string `s` (either '+' or '-'). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must point to the next character in the string `s`. If `i` was pointing to the last character in the string `s`, the loop would terminate.

Let's denote the current position of `i` as the index `j` in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `s[j]`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `s[j+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the string `s` relative to the current character `i`.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`**. 

However, to be more precise, if we assume `i` was at index `j` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration `i` will be at index `j+1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `j`, we can say that `i` is the next character in the sequence.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
