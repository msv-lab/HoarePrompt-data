Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "+" and "-". For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the length of the string and the count of "-" characters in it. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of "-" characters), otherwise it prints `n`.**
