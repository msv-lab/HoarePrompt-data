The code snippet `neg += 1` increments the value of the variable `neg` by 1. None of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `neg` is incremented by 1.**
