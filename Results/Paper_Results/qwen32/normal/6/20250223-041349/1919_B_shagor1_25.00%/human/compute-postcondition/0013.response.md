To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variable `neg` is updated. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and increments `neg` by 1 whenever it encounters a '-' character.

Given this understanding, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `neg` will be equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`. The variable `n` and the string `s` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

Here's how we can describe the final output state:

- `n` remains the same as the initial length of the string `s`.
- `s` remains the same as the initial string.
- `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` is the initial string.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `neg` will hold the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, while `n` and `s` will be the same as they were at the start.
