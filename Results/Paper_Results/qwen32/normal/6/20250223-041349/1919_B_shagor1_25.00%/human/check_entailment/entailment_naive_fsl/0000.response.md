Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be trying to count the number of '+' and '-' characters and then calculating a penalty based on that, but it does not implement the logic for optimally splitting the array to minimize the penalty.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array. The provided code does not follow this approach and instead uses a simple formula that does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
5
++--+
```
The correct output should be `4` because the optimal split is `([1,1,-1,-1],[1])` which gives a penalty of `|1+1-1-1|*4 + |1|*1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, the provided code will output `5 - 2 * 2 = 1` (since there are 3 '+' and 2 '-'), which is incorrect for this case.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum penalty for splitting the array.
