Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the incorrect calculation of the cost based on the logic used. Specifically, the way the tickets are bought and the cost is calculated does not align with the problem description. 

Let's break down the issues with the given code:

1. **Incorrect Ticket Buying Strategy**:
   - The code sorts the prices and then tries to buy tickets in a way that does not minimize the total cost. It buys tickets in chunks of `m` or less from the cheapest days, but it does not consider the increasing prices correctly.
   - The code does not dynamically adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase, which is a critical part of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation formula used in the code is incorrect. The cost should be calculated based on the adjusted prices after each purchase, but the code does not do this properly.
   - The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and the additional terms do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is very large or where the number of days (`n`) is very large.
   - It also does not handle cases where the prices are very high or where the maximum tickets per day (`m`) is very large.

To correctly solve the problem, a more dynamic and greedy approach is needed. The code should:
- Sort the days by price.
- Buy tickets in such a way that the cost is minimized, considering the increasing prices after each purchase.
- Dynamically adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase.

Here is a corrected version of the code that follows the problem description:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        M.sort()
        cost = 0
        bought = 0
        for price in M:
            if bought >= k:
                break
            to_buy = min(m, k - bought)
            cost += to_buy * (price + bought)
            bought += to_buy
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the prices and buys tickets in a greedy manner, dynamically adjusting the prices after each purchase. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.
