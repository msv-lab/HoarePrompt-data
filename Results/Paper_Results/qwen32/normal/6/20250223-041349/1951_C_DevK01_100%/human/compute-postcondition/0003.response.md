The code assigns a new list `M` which is created by converting the space-separated input values into integers. The initial state of `t` and `L` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
