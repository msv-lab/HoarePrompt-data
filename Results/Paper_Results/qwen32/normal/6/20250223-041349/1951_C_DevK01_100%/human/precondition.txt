Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of tickets that can be purchased each day, and k is the total number of tickets to be bought. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
