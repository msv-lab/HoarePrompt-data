Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been recalculated to be `mu * w`, where `mu` and `w` are previously defined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `N`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
