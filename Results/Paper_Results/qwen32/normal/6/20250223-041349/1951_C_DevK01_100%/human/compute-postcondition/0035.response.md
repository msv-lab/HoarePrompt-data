Let's analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the variables and their values.

The code snippet is:
```python
cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
```

Here are the variables and their current values based on the initial state:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 0
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order
- `n` is `q - 1`
- `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`
- `k` is `L[2]`
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`
- `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed
- `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`
- `cost` is `mu * w`

Now, let's calculate the new value of `cost` using the given formula.

The formula to update `cost` is:
```python
cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
```

Breaking it down:
- `m * sum(N)`: This is `m` multiplied by the sum of all elements in `N`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: This is `m` squared multiplied by the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.
- `n * m * mu`: This is `n` multiplied by `m` and then by `mu`.

The new `cost` will be the sum of the current `cost` and the result of the above expression.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `q - 1`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
