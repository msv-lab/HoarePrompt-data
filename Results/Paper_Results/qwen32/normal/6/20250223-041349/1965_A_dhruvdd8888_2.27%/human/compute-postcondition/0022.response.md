The code snippet provided increments the variable `cd` by 1. The values of other variables such as `N`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `cd` is incremented by 1.**
