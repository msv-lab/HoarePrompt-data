Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `cd` is `cd + 1`.**

The value of `cd` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
