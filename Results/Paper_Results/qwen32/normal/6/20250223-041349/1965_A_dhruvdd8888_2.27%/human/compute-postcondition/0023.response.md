Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `N`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
