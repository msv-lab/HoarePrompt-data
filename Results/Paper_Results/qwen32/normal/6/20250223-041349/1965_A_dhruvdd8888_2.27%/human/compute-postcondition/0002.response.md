The code snippet provided attempts to sort a set of unique strings (`nums`) after converting them to integers. However, there is a logical inconsistency in the code since `nums` is described as a set of unique strings, and converting a set of strings to integers and sorting them would imply that `nums` initially contains string representations of integers.

Assuming the intention is to convert and sort a list of string representations of integers, here's the output state:

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The set `nums`, which contains unique strings, is converted to a list of integers and then sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
