Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2; `cd` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `cd` has been initialized to 0. All other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged.
