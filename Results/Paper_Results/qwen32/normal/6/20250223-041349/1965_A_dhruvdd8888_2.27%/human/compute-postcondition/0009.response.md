Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.**

Natural Language: The list `nums` has been modified by inserting the integer `0` at the beginning of the list, while all other variables (`N`, `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged. The list `nums` is still sorted in ascending order, but now includes an additional element at the start.
