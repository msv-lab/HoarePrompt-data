Output State: **The program returns 'Bob'**. The code snippet calls the `print` function with the string 'Bob', which means 'Bob' is outputted. However, since the task specifies to describe what is returned, and `print` does not return a value in the traditional sense (it returns `None`), the output state focuses on what is printed.
