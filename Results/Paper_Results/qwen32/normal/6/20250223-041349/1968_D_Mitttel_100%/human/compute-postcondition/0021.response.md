Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[p[P_S]]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)` and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is `3 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.
