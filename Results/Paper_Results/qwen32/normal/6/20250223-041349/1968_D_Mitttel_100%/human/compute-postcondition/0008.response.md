Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `k` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`; `cur` is `a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
