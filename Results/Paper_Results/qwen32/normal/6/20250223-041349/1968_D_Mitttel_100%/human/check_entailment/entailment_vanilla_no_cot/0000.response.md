Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes that once a cycle is detected, the player can continue to stay in the cycle and add `k * a[s]` to their score, which is not the case. The player can only stay in the cycle for the remaining turns, not `k` turns.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cycle_length = 0
    cycle_sum = 0
    in_cycle = False
    
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
        if vis[s]:
            in_cycle = True
            cycle_start = s
            cycle_length = 1
            cycle_sum = a[s]
            s = p[s]
            while s != cycle_start:
                cycle_length += 1
                cycle_sum += a[s]
                s = p[s]
            break
    
    if in_cycle:
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        full_cycles = k // cycle_length
        cur += full_cycles * cycle_sum
        mx = max(mx, cur)
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            cur += a[s]
            mx = max(mx, cur)
            s = p[s]
    
    return mx
```

This corrected function properly handles the case where the player enters a cycle and calculates the score based on the number of full cycles they can complete and the remaining turns.
