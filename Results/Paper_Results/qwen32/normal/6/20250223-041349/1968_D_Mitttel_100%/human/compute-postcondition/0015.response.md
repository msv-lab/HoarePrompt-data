The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to be the value of `p` at the index `s`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`. After the code executes, `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[p[P_S]]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 0, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
