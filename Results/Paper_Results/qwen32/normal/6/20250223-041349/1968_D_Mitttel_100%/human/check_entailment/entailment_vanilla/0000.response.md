Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to make them zero-based (Python uses zero-based indexing).

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position.
   - `func_1` takes the array `a`, the permutation `p`, the starting position `s`, and the number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions.
   - It then iterates while the current position has not been visited and there are turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration:
     - It marks the current position as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to be the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays in the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score of the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position as defined by the permutation `p`.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It compares the scores and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Index Adjustment:** The program incorrectly adjusts the indices of `a` and `p` by subtracting 1. While `p` should be adjusted to zero-based indexing, `a` should remain as is since its values represent scores and not positions.
- **Score Calculation:** The logic in `func_1` to calculate the score is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect. It assumes that staying in the current position for the remaining turns will yield the maximum score, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve considering the best possible moves at each step, which can be more complex than the current implementation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
