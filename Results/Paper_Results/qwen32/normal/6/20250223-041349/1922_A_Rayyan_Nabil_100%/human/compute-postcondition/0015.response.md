The code snippet provided is `n = int(input().strip())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the input to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 20`, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever positive integer value the user inputs, provided it is within the specified range. The other variables will retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
