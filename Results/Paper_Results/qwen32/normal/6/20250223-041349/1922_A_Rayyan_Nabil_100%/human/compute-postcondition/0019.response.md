The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. The initial state has `results` containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. After the code execution, `results` will have three elements, with the third element being the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
