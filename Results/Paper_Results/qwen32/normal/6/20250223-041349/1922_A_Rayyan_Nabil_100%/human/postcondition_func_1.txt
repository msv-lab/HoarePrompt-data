The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It then processes these strings using the function `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
