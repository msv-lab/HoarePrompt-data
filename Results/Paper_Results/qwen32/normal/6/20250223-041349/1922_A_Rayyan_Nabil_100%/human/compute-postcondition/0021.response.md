The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

Given that `t` is the number of elements in the `results` list and `t` is defined as `t` >= 0, the loop will only execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0, the `results` list will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The initial state of `result` does not need to be specified because `result` will take on the values of the elements in the `results` list one by one during the loop iterations.

State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.**
