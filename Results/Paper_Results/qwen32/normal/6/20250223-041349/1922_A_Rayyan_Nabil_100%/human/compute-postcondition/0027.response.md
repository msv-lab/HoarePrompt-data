To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop progresses and what changes occur in the variables.

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints each element. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list, which is `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until all `t` elements in the `results` list have been printed.

The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified in the loop body. The only variable that changes is `result`, which takes on the value of each element in the `results` list in sequence.

After all iterations are complete, the loop will have printed all `t` elements from the `results` list. The final state of the variables will be the same as the initial state, except that the loop will have completed its execution.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.**

In simple terms, all the variables remain in their initial state, and the loop has completed printing all elements in the `results` list.
