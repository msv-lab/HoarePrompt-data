To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variables that we can adjust are `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted explicitly).

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is an empty list**.
