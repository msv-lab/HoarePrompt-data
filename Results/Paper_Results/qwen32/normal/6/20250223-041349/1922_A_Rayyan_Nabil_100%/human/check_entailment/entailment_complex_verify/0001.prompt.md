You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of strings a, b, and c, and a, b, and c are strings of lowercase Latin letters each of length n.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without returning 'YES'.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It checks each corresponding character in the strings `a` and `b` against the character in `c`. If there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` have characters different from the character in `c`, the function returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all characters, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It then processes these strings using the function `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if there exists a template string `t` that matches two strings `a` and `b` while not matching string `c`. The matching rules are:
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of the matching string must be the same.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of the matching string must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.

### Template Creation
For each position `i` in the strings, we need to create a character in the template `t`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). So, the template character can be the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]` but not both. So, we can choose the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `c[i] != a[i]` or the uppercase version of `b[i]` if `c[i] != b[i]`.

### Program Analysis
The given program uses a simple approach:
- For each position `i` in the strings, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it returns "YES".
- Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness Check
The given program does not correctly implement the template matching logic. The program only checks if there is any position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is not sufficient to ensure that the template can be constructed as described above:
- It does not ensure that for positions where `a[i] == b[i]`, `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`.
- It does not ensure that the template can be constructed to match `a` and `b` while not matching `c` for all positions.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
