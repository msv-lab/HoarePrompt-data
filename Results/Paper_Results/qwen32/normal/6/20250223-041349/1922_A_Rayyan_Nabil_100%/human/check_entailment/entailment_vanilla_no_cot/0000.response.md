Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which is not sufficient to determine if there exists a valid template `t` as per the problem's requirements.

The correct approach should involve checking if for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, we can assign a character to the template `t` such that:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be uppercase and different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring `c[i]` does not match.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be set to `a[i]` in uppercase or `b[i]` in uppercase, ensuring `c[i]` does not match if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

The provided program only checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which is not sufficient to guarantee a valid template `t` as described in the problem statement.
