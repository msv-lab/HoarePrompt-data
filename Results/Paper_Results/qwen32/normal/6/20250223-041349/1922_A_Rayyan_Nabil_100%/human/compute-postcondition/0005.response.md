The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` to be the input string, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is an empty list.**
