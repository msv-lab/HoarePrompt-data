The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `a` by reading a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
