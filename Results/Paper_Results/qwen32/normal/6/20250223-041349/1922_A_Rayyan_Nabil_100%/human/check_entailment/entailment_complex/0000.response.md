### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not. The conditions for matching are:
- If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, the i-th character of the string must be the same as the i-th character of the template.
- If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of the template.

The solution provided consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position where both `a` and `b` have characters different from the character in `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a valid template can be constructed. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function iterates over each character position from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If it finds such a position, it immediately returns 'YES'.
- If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

This logic is correct because if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, we can construct a template where that position is an uppercase letter corresponding to `c[i]`. This ensures `a` and `b` match the template (since they are different from `c[i]`), while `c` does not match (since it is the same as `c[i]`).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
- It prints the results for each test case.

This function correctly processes multiple test cases and utilizes `func_1` to determine the correct output for each case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` is sound and matches the requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
