Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**

The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remains unchanged. The `results` list now contains two elements, each being the return value of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
