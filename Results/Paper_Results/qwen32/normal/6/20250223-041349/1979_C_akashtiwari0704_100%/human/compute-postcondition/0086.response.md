The code snippet updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with the `i`-th element of the list `l` and then performing integer division with the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `g`.

Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**.
