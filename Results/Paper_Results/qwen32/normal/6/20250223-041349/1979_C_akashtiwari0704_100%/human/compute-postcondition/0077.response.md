To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and modified.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
3. **`k`**: A list of integers of length `n` where each element \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
4. **`T`**: Set to 1.
5. **`g`**: Set to 1.
6. **`bets`**: An integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
7. **`a`**: A list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]` for \(i\) from 0 to `bets-1`.
8. **`prod`**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`.
9. **`sumo`**: The sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list.
10. **`ans`**: A string containing the first `bets` elements of `a` each followed by a space.
11. **`l`**: A list with at least one element.
12. **`i`**: Set to `bets-1`.
13. **`sumo`**: Less than `prod`.

### Key Variables:
- **`a`**: Initially unknown, but the first `bets` elements are modified based on `prod`.
- **`prod`**: The least common multiple of the list `a`.
- **`ans`**: A string formed by joining the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list, each followed by a space.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is constructed as follows:
- The first `bets` elements of the list `a` are modified to `prod // a[i]` for \(i\) from 0 to `bets-1`.
- These modified elements are then joined into a string with each element followed by a space.

### Example Scenario:
To make this more concrete, let's assume some values:
- Suppose `a = [10, 15, 20]` and `bets = 2`.
- The LCM (`prod`) of `[10, 15, 20]` is 60.
- The first `bets` elements of `a` are modified to:
  - \(a[0] = 60 // 10 = 6\)
  - \(a[1] = 60 // 15 = 4\)
- The modified list for the first `bets` elements is `[6, 4]`.
- The string `ans` is formed by joining these elements with a space: `"6 4 "`.

### General Case:
In the general case, the string `ans` will be the concatenation of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list, each followed by a space.

### Output:
Given the construction of `ans`, the output will be a string of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list, each followed by a space.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list, each followed by a space)**
