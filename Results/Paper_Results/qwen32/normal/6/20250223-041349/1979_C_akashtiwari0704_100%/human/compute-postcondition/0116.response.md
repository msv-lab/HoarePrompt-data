Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `ans` is a string that contains the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, with each element followed by a space.
- `i` is defined as `bets - 1`.

Since the specific contents of the list `a` and the value of `bets` are not given, we can only describe the structure of `ans` based on the information provided.

The string `ans` is constructed by taking the first `bets` elements from the list `a` and appending a space after each element. Therefore, if `a` had elements `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]` and `bets` was 3, then `ans` would be the string `"a1 a2 a3 "`.

Given this understanding, the `print(ans)` statement will output this constructed string.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string containing the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space)**
