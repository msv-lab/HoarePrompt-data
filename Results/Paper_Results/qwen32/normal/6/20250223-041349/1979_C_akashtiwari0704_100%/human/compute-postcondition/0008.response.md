The code snippet updates the value of `g` using the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Here, `gcd(g, l[i])` computes the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. After this operation, the value of `g` changes, but the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is `i + 1`**.
