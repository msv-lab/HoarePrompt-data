The code snippet provided updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` to `prod // a[i]`. Given that `a[i]` was previously updated to `prod // a[i]`, this operation effectively recalculates the `i`-th element of the list `a` using the same formula.

Since the exact values of `prod` and `a[i]` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `a[i]` in terms of `prod` and the original `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element has been updated to `prod // (prod // a[i])` which simplifies to `a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the original list `a`, `sumo` is `a[i]`, `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the `i`-th element of `a` remains unchanged after the operation.
