The value of `g` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, and `g` is 1.
