The code snippet provided is `bets = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `bets`. The initial state does not mention `bets` at all, so we introduce it with its new value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, and `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user.**
