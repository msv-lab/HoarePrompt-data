Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Then, it reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - Finally, it reads the list `b` of `m` integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of good subsegments of `a` of length `m` that have at least `k` elements matching `b` after rearrangement.
   - It starts by creating a `Counter` object for `b` (`cb`) and the first `m` elements of `a` (`ca`).
   - It computes the sum of the intersection of `ca` and `cb` (`sm`), which gives the number of matching elements in the initial subsegment.
   - It checks if `sm` is at least `k` and increments the answer `ans` if it is.
   - It then slides the window across the array `a` by one element at a time:
     - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window, it updates the count in `ca`.
     - If the count of `a[r]` in `ca` becomes greater than or equal to its count in `cb`, it increments `sm`.
     - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window, it updates the count in `ca`.
     - If the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` becomes less than its count in `cb`, it decrements `sm`.
     - It checks if `sm` is at least `k` and increments the answer `ans` if it is.
   - Finally, it returns the count of good subsegments.

### Issues in the Program

- **Sorting**: The program sorts `a[:m]` and `b` when creating `Counter` objects (`cb = Counter(sorted(b))` and `ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`). Sorting is unnecessary and incorrect here because the problem does not require the elements to be in any specific order. The `Counter` class already counts the occurrences of each element, and sorting would disrupt the correct counting of elements in the sliding window.
- **Intersection Calculation**: The intersection calculation (`sm = sum((ca & cb).values())`) is correct, but it should be done without sorting the lists.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary sorting of the lists when creating `Counter` objects. The corrected program, which removes the sorting, should work correctly.

Correctness: **False** (for the given program)  
Correctness: **True** (after removing the sorting)
