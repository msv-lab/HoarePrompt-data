The only object in the loop head is the variable `u`, which iterates over `tree.vertices[v].children`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `u` to the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is a vertex with at least one child.
- `postorder` is not empty.
- `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u`.
- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated based on `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.
- Depending on `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented or `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated.

Since `u` is the current child being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `u` should be the next child in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. 

Let's denote the current `u` as `u_current` and the next `u` as `u_next`.

State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` are updated based on the previous iteration's `u_current`.**
