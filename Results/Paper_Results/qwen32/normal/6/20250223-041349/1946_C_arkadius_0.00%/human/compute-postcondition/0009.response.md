The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`. The `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`. The variables `u` and `v` are read from the input, and `i` is 3. The `tree` now includes an additional edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `u` and `v` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of the `tree` is also not altered by this specific code snippet, as the edge addition is mentioned in the initial state and not in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `k` is the second integer input, `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 3.**
