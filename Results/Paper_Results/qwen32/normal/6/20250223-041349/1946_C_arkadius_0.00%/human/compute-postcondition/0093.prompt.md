Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`. `postorder` is not empty. If `postorder` was empty before, `stack` had `n + 1` elements where the first element was `(v, True)` and the remaining `n` elements were `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`. Otherwise, `stack` had one less element than before. The current state of `postorder` indicates that there are still elements to process in `postorder`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. In both cases, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` remains unchanged unless `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`, in which case it is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). `u` is `u_next`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. The values of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remain unchanged unless `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`, in which case `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
