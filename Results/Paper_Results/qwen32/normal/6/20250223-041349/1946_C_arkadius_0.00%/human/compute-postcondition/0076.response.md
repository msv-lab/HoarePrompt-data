The only variable in the loop head is `u`, which iterates over `tree.vertices[v].children`. To ensure the loop can execute, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element.

Given the provided state:
- `v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`.
- `postorder` is not empty.
- If `postorder` was empty before, `stack` had `n + 1` elements where the first element was `(v, True)` and the remaining `n` elements were `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`.
- Otherwise, `stack` had one less element than before.
- `postorder` indicates there are still elements to process.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element. Therefore, `v` must be a vertex that has at least one child.

State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u`**
