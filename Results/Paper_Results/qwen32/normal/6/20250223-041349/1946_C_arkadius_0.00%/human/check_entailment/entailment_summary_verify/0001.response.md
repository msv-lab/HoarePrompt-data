### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its functions based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Objective**: Find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and edges are adjusted to be 0-indexed.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at the specified vertex, setting up the tree for traversal.

2. **Functions**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**:
     - Both functions perform a postorder traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack.
     - `func_2` is a recursive version of the same logic.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - Checks if it is possible to have \( k \) good components with each having at least \( x \) vertices.
     - Uses `func_1` to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - Returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_4`**:
     - Performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
     - Initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to \( n \).
     - Uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is feasible.
     - Adjusts `beg` and `end` based on the result of `func_3`.
   - **`func_5`**:
     - Reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.

#### Function Summaries:
- **`func_5`**: Reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges provided as input. After rooting the tree at node 0, it calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.
  - **Issue**: The summary is inaccurate as it does not correctly describe the output. The output is the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges, not the number of connected components.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Binary Search in `func_4`**:
  - The binary search logic is correct for finding the maximum \( x \).
- **Traversal and Calculations in `func_1` and `func_3`**:
  - The traversal logic appears correct for calculating the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - `func_3` correctly checks if the conditions are met for a given \( x \).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases where \( k \) is 1 and \( n \) is 2 correctly, as demonstrated in the example.
  - It also handles cases where \( k \) is close to \( n \) and where \( k \) is small.

### Conclusion:
While the program's logic for binary search and traversal seems correct, the function summary for `func_5` is inaccurate. The summary should describe the output as the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem despite the inaccurate summary for `func_5`.

**Final: True**
