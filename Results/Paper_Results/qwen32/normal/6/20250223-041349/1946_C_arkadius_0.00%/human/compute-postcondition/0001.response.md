The code snippet creates an instance of a `Tree` class with `n` as an argument. This action initializes a tree structure with `n` nodes. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition `1 <= k < n` still holds true after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes.**
