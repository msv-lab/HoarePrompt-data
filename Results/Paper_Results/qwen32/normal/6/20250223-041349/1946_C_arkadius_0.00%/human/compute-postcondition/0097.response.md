Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an object representing a tree structure with vertices containing attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`, a parameter `s`, which is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and a parameter `x`, which is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. The function returns a tuple containing two values: the total count of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex `s` (including `s` itself if `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size >= x`), and the sum of the remaining sizes of all subtrees rooted at `s` where the remaining size is less than `x`.**
