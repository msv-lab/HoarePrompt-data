The method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called on the `tree` instance, which is expected to perform some operations to root the tree at node 0, with -1 indicating no parent (since it's the root). However, without the specific implementation details of the `Tree` class and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method, we can only infer that this method will modify the internal state of the `tree` object to reflect the new rooting.

Given the initial state and the fact that the method does not return a value, we can infer that the `tree` object will be modified in place. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` do not appear to be directly affected by the method call based on the provided information.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` that has been rooted at node 0; `i` is `n-1`.**
