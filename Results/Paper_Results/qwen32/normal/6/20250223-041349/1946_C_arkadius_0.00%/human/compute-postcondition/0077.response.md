Output State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u`; `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In natural language: The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
