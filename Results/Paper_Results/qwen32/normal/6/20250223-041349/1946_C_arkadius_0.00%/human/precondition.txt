t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. The sum of all n values across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5. Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v and u such that 1 <= v, u <= n, representing the edges of the tree.
