Output State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language: The value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
