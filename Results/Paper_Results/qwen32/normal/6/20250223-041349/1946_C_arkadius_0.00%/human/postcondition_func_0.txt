The function `func_1` processes a tree structure starting from a specified vertex `s`. It calculates and updates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex in the subtree rooted at `s`. A good component is defined as a subtree with a remaining size of at least `x`. The function returns a tuple containing the total count of good components in the subtree rooted at `s` (including `s` itself if its remaining size is at least `x`) and the sum of the remaining sizes of all subtrees rooted at `s` where the remaining size is less than `x`.
