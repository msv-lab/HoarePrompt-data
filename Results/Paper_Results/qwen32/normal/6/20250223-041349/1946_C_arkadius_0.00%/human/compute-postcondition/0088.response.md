The only object in the loop head is the variable `u`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more children in `tree.vertices[v].children` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `u` was set to `u_current`, and `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, `u` should be set to `u_next`, which is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). `u` is `u_next`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. In both cases, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` remains unchanged unless `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`, in which case it is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
