The function `func_2` evaluates a tree structure starting from a given vertex `v`. It calculates two values: `good_components`, which counts the number of connected components in the subtree rooted at `v` that have a size of at least `x`, and `remaining_size`, which represents the size of the remaining connected component after accounting for the larger components. The function returns these two values, providing insight into the distribution and size of connected components within the subtree.
