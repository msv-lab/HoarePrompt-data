You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for each of the `n-1` pairs read from the input; `i` is `n-1`.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is an instance of Tree rooted at node 0, n is an integer greater than 1, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n. The function returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
