The code snippet adds an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` in the `tree` instance. The values of `n`, `k`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, and `i` is still 2. The state of the `tree` is updated to include the new edge.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is 2. The `tree` now includes an additional edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`.**
