The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` takes the return value of `func_1()`, which is a string, and splits it into two parts. These parts are then assigned to `r` and `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`.
- `ans` is an empty set.
- `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `temp` is an empty set.

After executing the code, `r` and `c` will be updated to the split values of the string returned by `func_1()`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`; `ans` is an empty set; `r` and `c` are the split values from the string returned by `func_1()`; `temp` is an empty set.**
