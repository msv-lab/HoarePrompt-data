You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the initial player with the ball such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration, `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration, except that if `0` was in `ans`, it is now removed and `n` is added to `ans`. `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, and `temp` is an empty set.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the modified ans list after the described operations)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted values of the modified `ans` list (where each element is derived from the original `ans` list by applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is not '0', or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and `0` is replaced by `n` if present)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (an integer representing the number of throws made, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (an integer representing the initial player with the ball, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the player number who ends up with the ball after `m` throws.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
