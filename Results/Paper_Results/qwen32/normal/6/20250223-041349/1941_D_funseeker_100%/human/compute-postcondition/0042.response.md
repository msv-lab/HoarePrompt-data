The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`.

Given that:
- `temp` is a set that may already contain some elements.
- `q` is the next element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n` is an integer.

The value of `temp` will now include the new element `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet. `temp` is a set that includes the element `(q + r) % n`.**
