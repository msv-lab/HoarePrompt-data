Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is a set containing the same values as the new `ans`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` has been updated to a new set of values calculated based on the original `ans`, `r`, `n`, and the condition of `c`. All other variables retain their previous values.
