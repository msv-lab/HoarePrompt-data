Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
r, c = func_1().split()
```

The code invokes `func_1()` and expects it to return a string. This string is then split into two parts, which are assigned to the variables `r` and `c`.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only new variables introduced are `r` and `c`, which are assigned the split values from the string returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` and `c` are the split values from the string returned by `func_1()`.**
