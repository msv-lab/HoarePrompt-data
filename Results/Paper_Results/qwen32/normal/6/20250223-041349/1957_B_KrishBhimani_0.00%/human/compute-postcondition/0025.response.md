The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used to iterate over the elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, the list `arr` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, and `c`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is an empty list; `c` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute since `arr` has at least one element to iterate over.
