The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of the variable `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is `k0 // 2`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 1; `arr` is [0] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
