The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `c` is initially set to `n`. Therefore, after the increment, `c` becomes `n + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `t` is still an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
- `l1` is still a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace.
- `n` is still the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is still 0.
- `k0` is still 1.
- `i` is still 2.
- `arr` is still [0, 2].
- `ans` is still [4, -3] if `c` originally equaled `n - 1` (which is not the case here since `c` was `n`), otherwise `ans` remains [4].

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is [4]**
