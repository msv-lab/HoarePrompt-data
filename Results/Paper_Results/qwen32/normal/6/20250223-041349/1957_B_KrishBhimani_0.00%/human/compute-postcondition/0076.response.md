Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2]; `ans` is [0]; `c` is equal to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Thus, all variables retain their initial values.
