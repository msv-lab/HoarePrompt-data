The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the result of the bitwise left shift operation `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` or `[1, k0 - 1]`, and `i` is the second element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the second element of `arr`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`; `c` is `n` if it was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `c` is its original value plus 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `1` left-shifted by `i` bits. All other variables remain unchanged.
