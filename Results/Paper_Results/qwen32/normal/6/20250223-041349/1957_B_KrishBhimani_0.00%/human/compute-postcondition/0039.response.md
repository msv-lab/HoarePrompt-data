The given code appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans)`. 

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` was initially either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` or `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`.
- The sum of the initial `ans` list is either `0 + 1 + (k0 - 1) + (1 << i) = k0 + (1 << i)` or `1 + (k0 - 1) + (1 << i) = k0 + (1 << i)`.
- The new element to append is `k0 - (k0 + (1 << i)) = - (1 << i)`.

Thus, the new `ans` list becomes either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]` or `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]`, `c` is `n` if it was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `c` is its original value plus 1**.
