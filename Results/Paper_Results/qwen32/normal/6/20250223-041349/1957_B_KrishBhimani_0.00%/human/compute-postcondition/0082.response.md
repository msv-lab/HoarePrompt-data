Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is either [8, -8] or [0, 8, -8]; `c` is `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
