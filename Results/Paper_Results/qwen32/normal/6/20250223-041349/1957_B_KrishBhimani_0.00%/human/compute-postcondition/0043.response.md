The given Python code snippet appends a value to the list `ans`. The value to be appended is `1 << i`, which is a bitwise left shift operation. This operation shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `i` positions, effectively computing `2^i`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` can be one of two forms:
1. If `c` was `n - 1` initially, `ans` was `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` was `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`.

In both cases, the code appends `1 << i` to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` will be:
1. If `c` was `n - 1` initially, `ans` becomes `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i), 1 << i]`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` becomes `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, 1 << i]`.

The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is also unchanged unless it was `n - 1` initially, in which case the most internal loop or if statement was broken out of, but this does not affect the value of `c` itself.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `c` is its original value plus 1 if it was not `n - 1` initially, `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i), 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, 1 << i]`.**
