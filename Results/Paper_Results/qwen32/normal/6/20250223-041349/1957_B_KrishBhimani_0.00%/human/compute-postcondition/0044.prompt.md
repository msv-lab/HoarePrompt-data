Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` contains the indices of all positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `k0` was 1; `ans` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1]`; `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met) plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the second element of `arr`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`; `c` is `n` if it was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `c` is its original value plus 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `c` is its original value plus 1 if it was not `n - 1` initially, `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i), 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, 1 << i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
