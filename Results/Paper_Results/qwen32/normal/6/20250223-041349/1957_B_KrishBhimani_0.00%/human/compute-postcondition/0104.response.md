Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is [0] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` is []; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
