The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing `k` by 2 and discarding the remainder.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is the integer value of `k`.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is [0] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` is [].
- `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20].
- `c` is `n`.

After the operation `k = k >> 1`, the value of `k` is updated to `k // 2` (integer division by 2). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2; `k0` is the integer value of `k` before the shift; `i` is 0; `arr` is [0] if `k` (before the shift) is odd, otherwise `arr` is []; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
