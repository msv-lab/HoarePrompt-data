The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the result of `k0 // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given that `k` is derived from `k0 // 2`, the smallest value `k0` can have to ensure `k` is greater than 0 is 2 (since 1 // 2 equals 0, and 2 // 2 equals 1). Therefore, `k0` must be at least 2, and consequently, `k` must be at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to modify only the objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is `k0 // 2` and `k0` must be at least 2; `i` is 1; `arr` is [0] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**
