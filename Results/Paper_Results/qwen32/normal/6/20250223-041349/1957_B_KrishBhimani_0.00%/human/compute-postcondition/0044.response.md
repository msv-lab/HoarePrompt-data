To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the indices in `arr`, which are the positions of the set bits in the binary representation of `k0`. For each index `i` in `arr`:
- If `c` equals `n - 1`, append `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and break out of the loop.
- Otherwise, append `1 << i` to `ans` and increment `c`.

### Observations from the Provided Output States
1. **After 1 Iteration**:
   - `ans` is `[1]` if `c` was not `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is `[0, 1]` if `c` was `n - 1`.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 if the loop did not break.

2. **After 2 Iterations**:
   - `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was not `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1`.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 if the loop did not break.

3. **After 3 Iterations**:
   - `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, 1 << i]` if `c` was not `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i), 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1`.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 if the loop did not break.

### Final Output State
The loop will continue until `c` reaches `n - 1` or all elements in `arr` have been processed. The final state depends on whether the loop breaks early or completes all iterations.

- **If the loop breaks early** (`c` reaches `n - 1` before processing all elements in `arr`):
  - `ans` will contain `n` elements, with the last element being `k0 - sum(ans[:n-1])`.
  
- **If the loop completes all iterations** (`arr` has fewer than `n` elements):
  - `ans` will contain all elements processed from `arr`, and the last element will be `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` reaches `n - 1` during the last iteration.

### Conclusion
Given that `arr` contains the indices of set bits in `k0`, and `k0` is initially `0`, `arr` will be an empty list. Therefore, the loop will not execute at all, and the initial state will remain unchanged.

However, if we assume that `k0` is a non-zero value with set bits, the loop will iterate over each set bit in `k0` until `c` reaches `n - 1`.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume `k0` is non-zero and has `m` set bits, where `m <= n`.

### Final Output State Calculation
- `ans` will contain the values `[1 << i1, 1 << i2, ..., 1 << im]` for each set bit index `i` in `arr`.
- If `m < n`, the loop will not break early, and `ans` will contain `m` elements.
- If `m == n`, the loop will break after the `n`-th iteration, and the last element will be `k0 - sum(ans[:n-1])`.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state will be:

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` contains the indices of all positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `k0` was 1; `ans` is a list of values `[1 << i1, 1 << i2, ..., 1 << im]` where `m` is the number of set bits in `k0`, and if `m < n`, the loop does not break; if `m == n`, the last element is `k0 - sum(ans[:n-1])`; `c` is `n` if the loop breaks, otherwise `c` is `m`.**

In simple terms, the final `ans` list will contain powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in `k0`, and if the number of set bits is less than `n`, the loop will not append the final calculated value. If the number of set bits equals `n`, the loop will append the final calculated value to `ans`.
