The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `c` is initially `n - 1` (since `ans` is `[1]` when `c` equals `n - 1`, and `ans` is an empty list otherwise). Therefore, after the increment, `c` will be equal to `n`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0]; `c` is `n`; `ans` remains an empty list if `c` was not previously `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is [1] and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
