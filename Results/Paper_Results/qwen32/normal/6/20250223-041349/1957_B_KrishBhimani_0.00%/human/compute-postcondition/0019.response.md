Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` and must be at least 2; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if the original `k` was an odd integer, otherwise `arr` is `[2]`.**
