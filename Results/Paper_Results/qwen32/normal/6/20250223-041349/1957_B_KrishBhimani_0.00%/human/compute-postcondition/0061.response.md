The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr` will now contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is `k0 // 2` and `k0` must be at least 2; `i` is 1; `arr` is [1]; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**.
