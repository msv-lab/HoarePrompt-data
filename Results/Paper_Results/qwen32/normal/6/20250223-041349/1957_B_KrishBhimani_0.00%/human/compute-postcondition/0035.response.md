Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the second element of `arr`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]`; `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met) plus 1. If `c` was `n - 1` initially, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
