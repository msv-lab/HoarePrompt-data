Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2, 3]; `c` is `n + 1`. If `c` equals `n`, `ans` is either [8, -8] or [0, 8, -8] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains either [8] or [0, 8].**

Natural Language: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, so `c` is now `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `c` equals `n`, which is not possible with the current value of `c`, `ans` would be either [8, -8] or [0, 8, -8] and the most internal loop or if statement would be broken. Otherwise, `ans` remains either [8] or [0, 8].
