The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `k`. Given that the initial value of `k` is 1, the operation `k >> 1` will result in `k` being 0.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that `0 <= t-1 <= 10^4`.
- `l1` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is now 0.
- `k0` remains 1.
- `i` remains 2.
- `arr` remains [1, 2] if `k` & 1 == 1, otherwise `arr` remains [1]. Since `k` is now 0, `k` & 1 == 0, so `arr` remains [1].
- `ans` remains [8, 8, 4, -20].
- `c` remains `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `0 <= t-1 <= 10^4`; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
