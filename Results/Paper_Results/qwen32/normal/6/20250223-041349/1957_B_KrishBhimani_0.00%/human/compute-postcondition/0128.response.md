The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` modifies the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `[4]`. The `sum(ans)` is `4`. The expression `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to `1 - 4`, which is `-3`. This value `-3` is then appended to `ans`, making `ans` equal to `[4, -3]`.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2]; `c` is `n`; `ans` is [4, -3]**.
