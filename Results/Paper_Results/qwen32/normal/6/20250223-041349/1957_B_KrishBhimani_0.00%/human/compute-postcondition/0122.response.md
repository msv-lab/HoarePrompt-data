The code snippet appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `k0` is 1 and `ans` is an empty list. Therefore, `sum(ans)` is 0. Consequently, `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to `1 - 0`, which is 1. This value is then appended to `ans`, making `ans` now equal to `[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0]; `ans` is [1]; `c` is equal to `n - 1`**.
