Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0]; if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is [1] and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list.**
