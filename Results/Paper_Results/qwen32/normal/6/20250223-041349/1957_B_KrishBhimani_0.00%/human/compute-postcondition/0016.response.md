The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is `k0 // 2`; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1]` if the original `k` was an odd integer, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.**
