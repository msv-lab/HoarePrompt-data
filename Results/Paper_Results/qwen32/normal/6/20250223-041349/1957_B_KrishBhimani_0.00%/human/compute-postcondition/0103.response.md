Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` is odd; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is [0]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`**

In this output state, the variable `arr` has been updated to include the value `0`, which was the value of `i` before the `append` operation. All other variables retain their initial values.
