You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` where `row[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d - i)`.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: `row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i >= d` is updated based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step, `min_heap` contains tuples representing the updated values of `row[i]` and their respective indices.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `row` which is updated based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `row`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `d`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row). The function updates the last element of `row` based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step and returns the updated last element of `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of `row` which is updated based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
