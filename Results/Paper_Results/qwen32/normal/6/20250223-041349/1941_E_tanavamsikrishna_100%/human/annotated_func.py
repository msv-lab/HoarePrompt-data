    #The program returns the last element of `row` which is updated based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies the input list `row` by setting the first element to 1, incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2, and then updating the elements from index `d` to the end based on the smallest element from a min-heap. It returns the last element of the modified `row`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that m >= 3, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, rows is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m where each element a_{i, j} satisfies 0 <= a_{i, j} <= 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 for all i.

    #State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs`, starting from the first element and ending at the last possible group of `k` elements; `i` is `len(costs) - k`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of each consecutive k elements of costs, and costs is a list of values returned by func_1(row, d) for each row in rows)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of rows to consider for cost calculation (`k`), and a distance parameter (`d`). It also reads a 2D list (`rows`) of integers with specific constraints. The function calculates a cost for each row using an unspecified function `func_1` and then computes the sum of costs for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of these costs.
