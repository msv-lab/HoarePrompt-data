To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

This condition involves:
1. `min_heap`: The heap from which an element `(x, y)` is popped.
2. `i`: The variable being compared against.
3. `d`: A constant value (given as 3).

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true.
- After popping `(1, 0)` from `min_heap`, the next element `(x, y)` must satisfy `y <= i - (d + 2)`.
- We are given that `d` is 3, so the condition simplifies to `y <= i - 5`.

### Given State:
- `row` where `row[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d - i)`.
- `d` is 3.
- `len(row)` is at least 4.
- `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - 5` after popping `(1, 0)`.
- `i` must be at least 5.

### Adjustment:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i` because `min_heap` is modified by popping an element and `d` is a constant.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the next `y` popped from `min_heap` must satisfy `y <= i - 5`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` must be at least 5 and we need to ensure that the next `y` popped from `min_heap` satisfies `y <= i - 5`, we need to make sure `i` is adjusted such that the condition can still hold true after the next pop.

Given that `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - 5` after popping `(1, 0)`, we need to ensure that `i` is large enough to allow for this condition to be true for the next element in `min_heap`.

### Final State:
State: **`row` where `row[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d - i)`, `d` is 3, `len(row)` is at least 4, `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - 5` after popping `(1, 0)`, `i` must be at least 5**.

Since the condition `y <= i - 5` must hold true for the next iteration, and `i` must be at least 5, we do not need to adjust `i` further as long as the next `y` popped from `min_heap` satisfies the condition. Therefore, we can repeat the given state.

State: **`row` where `row[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d - i)`, `d` is 3, `len(row)` is at least 4, `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` such that `y <= i - 5` after popping `(1, 0)`, `i` must be at least 5**.
