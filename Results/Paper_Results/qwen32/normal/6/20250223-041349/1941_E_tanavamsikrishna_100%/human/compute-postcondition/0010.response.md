Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs`, starting from the first element and ending at the last possible group of `k` elements; `i` is `len(costs) - k`.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues to execute until it has summed every possible group of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list. The `total_costs` list will contain the sum of these groups, and the loop variable `i` will have reached its final value, which is the index of the last starting point for a group of `k` elements in the `costs` list.
