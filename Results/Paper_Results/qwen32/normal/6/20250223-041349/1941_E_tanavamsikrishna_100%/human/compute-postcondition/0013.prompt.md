You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that m >= 3, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, rows is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m where each element a_{i, j} satisfies 0 <= a_{i, j} <= 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 for all i.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs`, starting from the first element and ending at the last possible group of `k` elements; `i` is `len(costs) - k`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of each consecutive k elements of costs, and costs is a list of values returned by func_1(row, d) for each row in rows)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns (with the constraint `m >= 3`), `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d <= m`, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` satisfies `0 <= a_{i, j} <= 10^6` and the first and last elements of each row are `0` (i.e., `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`). The function returns a value based on these inputs, though the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
