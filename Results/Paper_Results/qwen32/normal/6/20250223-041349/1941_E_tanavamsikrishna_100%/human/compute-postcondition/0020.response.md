Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + row[1] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains the element `e` and the element `(row[i], i)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The `min_heap` now includes an additional element, which is the tuple `(row[i], i)`. The values of `row[0]`, `row[1]`, and `row[2]` remain as specified, and `row[3]` and any elements beyond `row[3]` are unchanged.
