Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, but it does not correctly implement the constraints given in the problem, particularly the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation does not ensure that supports are placed within the required distance `d` from each other. 

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the heap operations to ensure that the minimum cost is always considered for placing supports within the required distance `d`. The while loop in `func_1` is not correctly implemented to skip over outdated heap elements, and the logic for maintaining the heap and calculating the costs is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm that respects the distance constraint `d` would be necessary. The current program does not guarantee that the minimum cost is found for placing supports within the constraints, and thus it is incorrect.
