Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns (with the constraint `m >= 3`), `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d <= m`, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` satisfies `0 <= a_{i, j} <= 10^6` and the first and last elements of each row are `0` (i.e., `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`). The function returns a value based on these inputs, though the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
