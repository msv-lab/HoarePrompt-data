To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the provided code, annotations, and the original assessment. The problem requires finding the minimum cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows of a river grid, adhering to specific constraints.

### Analysis of the Code

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`
This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row while ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

**Key Points:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0]` is set to 1, indicating a support at the first column.
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2, but this does not correctly account for the cost calculation considering the constraints.

2. **Heap Usage:**
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of supports within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - The loop iterates through the row from index `d` to the end, and for each position, it calculates the cost based on the smallest element in the heap.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost at each position `i` is calculated as `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e[0]` is the smallest cost from the heap and `row[i]` is the depth of the cell.
   - The heap is updated with the new cost and the original smallest cost.

**Issues Identified:**
- The initialization and the cost calculation logic seem flawed. Specifically, the initial increments by 2 for the first `d-1` elements do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` seems incorrect and might lead to incorrect cost calculations.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

**Key Points:**
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - Reads the grid of depths.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of installing supports.
   - Computes the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

### Evaluation Using Annotations

The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points, which can help us validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **Initialization in `func_1`:**
   - The annotations confirm that `row[0]` is set to 1 and the next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2, but this does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Heap Usage:**
   - The annotations describe the heap operations correctly, but the condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is not explained well and might lead to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The annotations show the cost calculation logic, but it does not account for the constraints correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment correctly identifies issues with the program. Specifically, the initialization and cost calculation logic in `func_1` do not align with the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly handle the constraints of the problem.
