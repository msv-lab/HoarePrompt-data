### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps to ensure that after a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the task.

Here's why:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is implemented in a way that it finds the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find` (or `n` if `find` is greater than all elements). This is not the correct behavior for the problem as it requires `array[l]` to be exactly `find` after the binary search completes.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function attempts to swap `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]` if `array[l]` is not equal to `find`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not guarantee that after the swap, the binary search will correctly identify `find` at position `l`. Specifically, it does not ensure that the array is in a state that allows binary search to find `find` at `l` after at most two swaps.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the number of operations and the swaps, but the logic to determine the correct swaps is incorrect.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that after at most two swaps, the binary search will find `x` at position `l`. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
