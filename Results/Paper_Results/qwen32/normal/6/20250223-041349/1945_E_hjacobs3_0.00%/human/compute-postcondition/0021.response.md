The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` in the context of an array and a value `find`, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `l` is defined as the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` (the length of the array) if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`.
2. The variable `r` is defined as `l - 1`.
3. It is also mentioned that `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

However, these definitions and conditions do not affect the execution of the `print(1)` statement. The `print(1)` statement will always output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
