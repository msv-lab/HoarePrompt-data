The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`, meaning the loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` accordingly.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`).
- `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`.
- Depending on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find`, `l` and `r` are adjusted as follows:
  - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is set to 0, `r` is set to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, and `mid` is set to `(n - 1) // 2`.
  - If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`, `r` is set to `n - 1`, and `mid` is set to `(n - 1) // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r` after the adjustments. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`. For the loop to continue, `0` must be less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`. This condition is true for `n` greater than 2.

2. If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, `l` is set to `mid + 1`, and `r` is set to `n - 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. This condition is true as long as `mid` is less than `n - 1`.

Since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should set `l` and `r` in a way that guarantees `l <= r`. Given that `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, we can set `l` to `mid` and `r` to `mid` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`. `l` is `(n - 1) // 2`. `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
