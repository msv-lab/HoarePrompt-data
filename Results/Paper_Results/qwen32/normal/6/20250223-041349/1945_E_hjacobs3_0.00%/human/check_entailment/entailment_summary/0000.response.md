### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - A permutation `p` of size `n`.
   - A number `x` that needs to be found in the permutation.
2. **Task:**
   - Perform at most 2 swaps on the array to ensure that after applying a binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm is defined as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`.
     - While `l <= r`:
       - Calculate `mid = (l + r) // 2`.
       - If `array[mid] >= find`, set `r = mid - 1`.
       - Else, set `l = mid + 1`.
     - After the loop, `l` should be the index where `p_l` equals `x`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly according to the description.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n - 1`, respectively.
   - The loop continues until `l > r`, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on the value of `array[mid]`, `l` or `r` is updated.

3. **Output:**
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `x`, it prints `1` and returns a list containing the indices to swap.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps:**
   - The program only performs a single swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x`.
   - It does not guarantee that after one swap, the binary search will yield `p_l` equal to `x`.
   - It also does not attempt a second swap if the first swap does not resolve the issue.
   - The problem states that at most 2 swaps are allowed and sufficient, but the program does not utilize this flexibility.

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints `1` or `0` before returning the list of swaps, which does not match the required output format.
   - The output should first print the number of swaps, followed by the swaps themselves.

3. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` equals `x` using at most 2 swaps.
   - It only attempts one swap and does not account for the possibility of needing a second swap.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search will yield `p_l` equal to `x`.

**Correctness: False**
