Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
