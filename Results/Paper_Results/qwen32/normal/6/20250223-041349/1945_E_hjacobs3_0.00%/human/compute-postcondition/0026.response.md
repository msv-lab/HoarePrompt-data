Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` to locate within the array. It returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`) and the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1 if `find` is in `array`. If `find` is not at the position indicated by `l`, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0.**
