The code snippet assigns the variable `l` the value of `0` and the variable `r` the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`. The variable `l` is 0, and the variable `r` is `n - 1`.**
