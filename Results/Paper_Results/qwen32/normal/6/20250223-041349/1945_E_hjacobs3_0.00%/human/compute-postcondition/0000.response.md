Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n). The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `n` now holds the length of the `array`, while `array` and `find` retain their initial values.
