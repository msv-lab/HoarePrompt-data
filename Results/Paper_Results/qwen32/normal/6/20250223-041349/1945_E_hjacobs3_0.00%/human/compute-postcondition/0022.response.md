To determine the output state, let's consider the provided initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`.
- `r` is `l - 1`.
- `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

Code Snippet:
```python
return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `l` is the smallest index where the element is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`.
- `array.index(find)` gives the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.

Since `l` is not equal to `array.index(find)`, `find` must be present in `array`, and `l` is the smallest index where an element is greater than or equal to `find`, which is not the index of `find` itself.

Let's denote:
- `l'` as `l + 1`
- `find_index'` as `array.index(find) + 1`

The return statement will output a list containing `str(l + 1)` and `str(array.index(find) + 1)`.

Output State: **The program returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` and the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.**
