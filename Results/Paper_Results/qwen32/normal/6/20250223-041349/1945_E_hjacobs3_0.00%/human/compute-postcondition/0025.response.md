Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be located within the `array`. The function returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the lower bound index used in the search process) and the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.**
