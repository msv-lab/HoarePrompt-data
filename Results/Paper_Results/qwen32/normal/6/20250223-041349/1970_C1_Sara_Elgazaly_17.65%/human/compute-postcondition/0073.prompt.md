Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a` along with its previous values for all `x-1` iterations, and `_` is incremented to `x-1`. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration. `s` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst[x]` is empty, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]` in the last iteration, `_` has been incremented 3 times, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `lst[x]` is empty, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x` unless a `lst[y]` was non-empty and caused a break, `s` is the opposite of its initial value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `lst[x]` is empty, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x`, and `s` is the original value of `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
