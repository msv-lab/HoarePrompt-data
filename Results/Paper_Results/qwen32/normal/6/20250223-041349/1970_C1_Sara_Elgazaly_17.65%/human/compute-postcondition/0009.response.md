The code snippet `lst[b].append(a)` modifies the defaultdict `lst` by appending the value `a` to the list that is the value for the key `b`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst[a]`, the tree structure, and the starting node for the round) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a`. `lst[a]` includes its previous values.**

In simpler terms, the Output State is: `n` is still an integer between 2 and 200,000 inclusive, `t` is 1, the tree structure and its properties remain the same, the starting node for the round is unchanged, `x` is still greater than 1, `y` remains the same integer read from the input, and `lst[b]` now includes `a` in its list, while `lst[a]` retains its previous values.
