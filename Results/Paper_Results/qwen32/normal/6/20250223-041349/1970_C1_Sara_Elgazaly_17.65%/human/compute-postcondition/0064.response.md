Output State: **`lst[x]` is a list with its last element removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `x` is equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `lst[x]`, `y`, or `x`. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of the variables with the addition that the program execution will break out of the loop or if statement.
