The value of `x` is 0. `lst[x]` refers to the first element of `lst`, which is `True`. However, `True` is a boolean value and does not have a `pop()` method. This code will raise an `AttributeError` because you cannot call `pop()` on a boolean. Assuming the intention was to have a list as the first element of `lst`, let's proceed with that assumption.

Let's assume `lst` is initially `[ [1, 2, 3], ... ]` for the sake of the example. `lst[0]` would be `[1, 2, 3]`, and `lst[0].pop()` would remove and return the last element of that list, which is `3`. After the `pop()` operation, `lst[0]` would be `[1, 2]`.

Given the initial state and assuming `lst[0]` is a list, the output state would be:
Output State: **`lst` is a list where `lst[0]` is a list with its last element removed, `x` is 0, and `y` is the removed element.**

If we assume `lst` was `[ [1, 2, 3], ... ]`, then:
Output State: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ...]`, `x` is 0, `y` is 3.**
