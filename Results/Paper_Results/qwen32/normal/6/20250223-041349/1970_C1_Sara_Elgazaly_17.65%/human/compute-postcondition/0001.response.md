The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst`. This dictionary will have lists as its default values. The initial state of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, and the starting node for each round remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value.**
