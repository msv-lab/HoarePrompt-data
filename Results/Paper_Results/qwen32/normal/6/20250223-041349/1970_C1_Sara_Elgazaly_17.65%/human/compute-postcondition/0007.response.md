The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the starting node, `x`, `y`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a`. `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
