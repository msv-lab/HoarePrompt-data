The code snippet `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the `i`-th element of the list `nums` by subtracting the value of `ls` from it. Given that `ls` is 0, the value of `nums[i]` does not change. Therefore, the list `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0**.
