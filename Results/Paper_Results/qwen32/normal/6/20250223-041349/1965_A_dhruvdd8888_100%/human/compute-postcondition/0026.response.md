The code snippet `cw = True` sets the variable `cw` to `True`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `i` is 0; `cw` is `True`.**
