The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ls` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `nums`, which remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings; `ls` is 0.**
