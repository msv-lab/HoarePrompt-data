The code snippet `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. 

Given the initial state, `nw` was `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `False`. `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`. After the assignment, `nw` will now have the same value as `cw`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`.**
