The code snippet provided assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Based on the initial state, `nw` was `True`, and `cw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` remains `True`.

After the execution of the code, the value of `nw` will be the same as `cw`. Therefore, if `cw` is `False` (meaning there is at least one element in `nums` equal to 1), `nw` will also be `False`. If `cw` is `True` (meaning there are no elements in `nums` equal to 1), `nw` will remain `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.**
