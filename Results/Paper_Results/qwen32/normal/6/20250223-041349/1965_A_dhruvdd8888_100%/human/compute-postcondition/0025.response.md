The code snippet `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of `nw`. Given that `nw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, the value of `cw` will be `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, and `False` otherwise. 

Since `nw` and `cw` were initially set to the same value based on the condition that any element in `nums` is equal to 1, the operation `cw = not nw` flips this value. Therefore, if `nw` was `True`, `cw` becomes `False`, and if `nw` was `False`, `cw` becomes `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `False`, `i` is 0**.
