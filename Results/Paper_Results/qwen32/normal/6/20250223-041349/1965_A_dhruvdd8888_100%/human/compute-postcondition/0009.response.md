The code snippet `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the value of `nums[i]` by subtracting `ls` from it. Given that `ls` is `nums[i]`, this operation effectively sets `nums[i]` to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element where `nums[i]` is 0, `ls` is `nums[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
