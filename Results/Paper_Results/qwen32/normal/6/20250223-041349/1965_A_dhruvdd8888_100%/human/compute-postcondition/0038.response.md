The given code snippet is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
