The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. None of the other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list where each element is the difference between the original element and the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`.**
