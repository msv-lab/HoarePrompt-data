The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides various variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string provided within it.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `N`: An input integer.
   - `nums`: A list of integers.
   - `ls`: The sum of all elements in the original `nums`.
   - `nw`: A boolean value that is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `True`.
   - `cw`: A boolean value that is currently `True`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print('Alice')`.
   - This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` to the console.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a literal string `'Alice'`, the output is not influenced by any of the variables defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **Alice**
