You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums.add('0')
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    ls = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] -= ls
        
        ls += nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list where each element is the difference between the original element and the cumulative sum of all previous elements, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.
    nw = True
    cw = True
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            cw = not nw
        else:
            cw = True
        
        nw = cw
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.
    if cw :
        print('Alice')
        #This is printed: Alice
    else :
        print('Bob')
        #This is printed: Bob
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `True` if `nums[1]` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a value (or values) based on the input for each test case, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
