To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `nums`, and the range parameters (`len(nums) - 2`, `0`, and `-1`).

### Analysis:
1. **`nums`**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums`. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 3 elements (since `len(nums) - 2` should be a valid index, meaning `len(nums) >= 3`).

2. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from `len(nums) - 2` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). The initial state of `i` before the loop starts is not relevant to the loop's execution, but we need to ensure that the range is valid.

3. **Range Parameters**:
    - `len(nums) - 2`: This should be a valid starting index.
    - `0`: This is the stopping index (exclusive), meaning the loop will stop before `i` reaches 0.
    - `-1`: This is the step, meaning `i` will decrement by 1 each time.

### Adjustments:
- **`nums`**: Ensure `nums` has at least 3 elements.
- **`i`**: No specific initial value is needed for `i` before the loop starts, but we need to ensure the range is valid.
- **Other Variables**: `t`, `N`, `ls`, `nw`, and `cw` are not mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`**

This ensures that the loop can execute by having a valid range for the loop variable `i`.
