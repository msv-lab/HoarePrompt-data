### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine whether it is possible to sort an array of integers in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If an element is greater than the previous one and is at least 10, it splits that element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the array, the program calls the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and compares it with the original array. If they are the same, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" if the array can be sorted, otherwise "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for splitting elements is incorrect. The program only checks the current element against the previous one and splits it if necessary. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after one pass. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first pass, the array will become `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted.
- The program should repeatedly attempt to split elements until no more splits can be made, and then check if the array is sorted. This requires a more robust approach to ensure that the array is fully processed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
