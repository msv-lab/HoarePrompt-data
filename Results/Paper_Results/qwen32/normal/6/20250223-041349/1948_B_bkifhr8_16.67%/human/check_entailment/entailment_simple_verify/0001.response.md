### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program currently only makes a single pass through the array and only splits an element if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10. This logic is insufficient because it does not handle multiple splits or recursive splits that might be necessary to sort the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 10, 3]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 10, 3]`, but it will not handle the `10` which should be split into `1` and `0`. The array remains unsorted, and the program will incorrectly output "Yes" if it checks the array after the first pass.

2. **Infinite Loop Possibility:**
   - The current logic does not have a mechanism to ensure that the array is fully processed. If multiple splits are needed, the program should continue to iterate through the array until no more splits are possible or the array is sorted. Without this mechanism, the program might enter an infinite loop or fail to sort the array properly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where splitting does not help in sorting the array. While the function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted, the transformation logic is flawed and might not reach a sorted state.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. The program only performs a single pass and does not handle all necessary transformations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
