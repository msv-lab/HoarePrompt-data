### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:

1. **Single Pass Transformation:**
   - The program only performs a single pass through the array to check and split elements. This is insufficient because multiple splits might be needed to sort the array. For example, in the array `[12, 10, 3]`, the program splits `12` into `[1, 2, 10, 3]`, but it does not handle the `10` which should be split into `1` and `0`.

2. **Incomplete Transformation Handling:**
   - The logic does not ensure that all possible splits are performed. After the first pass, the array might still contain elements that need to be split to achieve a sorted order. The program should repeatedly check and split elements until no more splits are possible or the array is sorted.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where splitting does not help in sorting the array. For instance, an array like `[1, 2, 3]` is already sorted and should return 'Yes', but the program might not handle this correctly if it does not perform a thorough transformation.

### Evaluation:

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out these flaws.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
