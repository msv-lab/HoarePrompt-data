Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is at least 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the same position. After processing the list, it checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.

However, the program only performs a single pass through the list and only splits elements if they are greater than the next element and greater than or equal to 10. This approach is not sufficient to ensure the list can be sorted in all cases. For example, consider the list `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first pass, the list remains `[12, 28, 5]` because the first element is not greater than the second element. The program then checks if the list is sorted and incorrectly outputs "NO" because the list is not sorted. However, it is possible to split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in the sorted list `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

A correct approach would involve repeatedly iterating through the list and splitting elements as long as the list is not sorted. This ensures that all possible splits are considered.

Correctness: **False**
