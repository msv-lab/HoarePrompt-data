You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a non-decreasing order using the given operations. Here are a few issues and potential cases where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Operations:**
   The program only performs a single operation per pair of elements if the first element is greater than the second one and greater than or equal to 10. However, the problem allows for multiple operations to be performed on any number of elements. The program does not handle this iteratively until no more operations are possible.

2. **Incorrect Insertion of Digits:**
   The program uses `a // 10` and `a % 10` to split a number into digits, which is incorrect for numbers with more than two digits. For example, the number 123 should be split into [1, 2, 3], but the current logic would only split it into [12, 3].

3. **No Iterative Checking:**
   After performing one operation, the program does not re-check the entire array to see if further operations are needed. It only performs one pass and then checks if the array is sorted.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
123 4 5 6
```
The correct output should be `YES` because we can split 123 into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is sorted. However, the provided program will only perform one operation and fail to sort the array correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Continuously check the array for any element that is greater than the next one and greater than or equal to 10.
2. Split such elements into their individual digits and re-insert them into the array.
3. Repeat this process until no more operations are needed.
4. Finally, check if the array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[p - 1] > arr[p] and arr[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = arr[p - 1]
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a)]
                arr = arr[:p-1] + digits + arr[p:]
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected program handles the splitting of numbers into digits correctly and iteratively checks and modifies the array until no more operations are possible.
