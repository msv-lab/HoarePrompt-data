Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a non-decreasing order using the given operations. Here are a few issues and potential cases where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Operations:**
   The program only performs a single operation per pair of elements if the first element is greater than the second one and greater than or equal to 10. However, the problem allows for multiple operations to be performed on any number of elements. The program does not handle this iteratively until no more operations are possible.

2. **Incorrect Insertion of Digits:**
   The program uses `a // 10` and `a % 10` to split a number into digits, which is incorrect for numbers with more than two digits. For example, the number 123 should be split into [1, 2, 3], but the current logic would only split it into [12, 3].

3. **No Iterative Checking:**
   After performing one operation, the program does not re-check the entire array to see if further operations are needed. It only performs one pass and then checks if the array is sorted.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
123 4 5 6
```
The correct output should be `YES` because we can split 123 into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is sorted. However, the provided program will only perform one operation and fail to sort the array correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Continuously check the array for any element that is greater than the next one and greater than or equal to 10.
2. Split such elements into their individual digits and re-insert them into the array.
3. Repeat this process until no more operations are needed.
4. Finally, check if the array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[p - 1] > arr[p] and arr[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = arr[p - 1]
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a)]
                arr = arr[:p-1] + digits + arr[p:]
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected program handles the splitting of numbers into digits correctly and iteratively checks and modifies the array until no more operations are possible.
