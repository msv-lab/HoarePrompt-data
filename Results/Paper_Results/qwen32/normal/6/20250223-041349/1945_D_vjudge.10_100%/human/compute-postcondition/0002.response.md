Postcondition: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `m`.**
