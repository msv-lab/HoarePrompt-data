Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` each containing `n` elements, and an integer `m`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.**
