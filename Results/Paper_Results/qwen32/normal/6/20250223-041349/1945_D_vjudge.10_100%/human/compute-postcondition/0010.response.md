The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n); `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`**
