Postcondition: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
