pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and m is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
