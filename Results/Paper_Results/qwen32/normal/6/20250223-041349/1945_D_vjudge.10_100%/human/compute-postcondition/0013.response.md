The code snippet `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Given `i` is `n - 3`, the code adds the minimum of `a[n-3]` and `b[n-3]` to `x`.

Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n). `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2]) + min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`. `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is `n - 3`.**
