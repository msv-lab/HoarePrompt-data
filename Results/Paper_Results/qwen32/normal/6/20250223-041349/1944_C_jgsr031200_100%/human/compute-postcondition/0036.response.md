To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information and the logic of the code.

The loop iterates over the range `n + 1` (i.e., from `0` to `n`). During each iteration, it checks the value of `freq[i]`:
- If `freq[i]` is 2 or more, it skips the current iteration.
- If `freq[i]` is exactly 1, it increments `cou` by 1.
- If `cou` reaches 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop must have either broken out of the loop during these iterations or continued to the end of the range `n + 1`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. If `freq[i]` was 0 or `cou` reached 2 during the first 3 iterations, the loop would have broken out, and the final output state would reflect the value of `i` at which the loop broke.
2. If the loop continued for all iterations, it would have completed the loop without breaking out, and `i` would have reached `n + 1`.

Given the information, let's assume the loop did not break out during the first 3 iterations. This implies that `freq[i]` was neither 0 nor did `cou` reach 2 during these iterations. Thus, `cou` could have been incremented up to 1 or remained 0, and `freq[i]` could have been 1 or more than 2.

To find the final state, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the loop completes all iterations:
- The loop iterates from `0` to `n`.
- `i` reaches `n + 1` without breaking out.
- `cou` and `freq` remain consistent with their values throughout the iterations.

Thus, the final output state would be:
- `i` would be `n + 1` after the loop completes.
- `cou` would reflect the number of times `freq[i]` was exactly 1 during the iterations.
- `freq` would remain unchanged as per its initial state, as no modifications are made to `freq` within the loop.

Since the loop does not modify `arr` or `freq` and only uses them to determine the output, the final output state is determined by the value of `i` when the loop completes.

Output State: **i is n + 1, cou reflects the number of times freq[i] was exactly 1 during the iterations, and freq remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the loop completes all iterations, and `i` ends up being `n + 1`. The value of `cou` depends on how many times `freq[i]` was exactly 1 during the iterations, and `freq` remains the same as it was initially.
