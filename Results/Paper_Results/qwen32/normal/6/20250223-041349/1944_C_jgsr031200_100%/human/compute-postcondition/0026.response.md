The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. Given the context, it does not change the values of any variables directly. The variables `arr`, `freq`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` retain their values as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `n` must be at least 0; `i` is incremented by 1; if `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
