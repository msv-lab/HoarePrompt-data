Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function is supposed to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. However, the current logic does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Counting Single Occurrences**: The function correctly counts the numbers that appear once in the array.
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The function incorrectly calculates the MEX. It should consider the optimal moves of both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The current approach does not simulate these moves.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- Alice will always pick the smallest number that she can to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will always pick the smallest number that he can to minimize the MEX.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `c` after all elements are picked.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
    
    # Determine the final score
    # Alice and Bob will play optimally, so we need to consider the parity of the number of elements
    # that appear an odd number of times.
    odd_count = sum(1 for count in freq if count % 2 != 0)
    
    # If the number of elements that appear an odd number of times is even, Alice can force the MEX to be mex.
    # If it is odd, Bob can force the MEX to be mex - 1.
    if odd_count % 2 == 0:
        print(mex)
    else:
        print(mex - 1)
```

This corrected function considers the optimal strategies of both players and correctly calculates the final score.
