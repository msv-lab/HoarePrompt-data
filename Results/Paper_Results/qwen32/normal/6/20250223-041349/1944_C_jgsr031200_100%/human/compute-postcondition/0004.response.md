Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`, and `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the integer at index `i` is 2 and all other integers remain 0. `i` is `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The value at `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is `arr[1]`. Therefore, the value at `freq[i]` changes from 1 to 2. All other elements in `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged.
