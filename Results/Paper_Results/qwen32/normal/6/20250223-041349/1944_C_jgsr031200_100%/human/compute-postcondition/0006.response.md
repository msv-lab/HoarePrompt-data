Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`, and `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the integer at index `i` is 3 and all other integers remain 0. `i` is `arr[2]`.**

The value at index `i` in the `freq` list has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other elements in `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged.
