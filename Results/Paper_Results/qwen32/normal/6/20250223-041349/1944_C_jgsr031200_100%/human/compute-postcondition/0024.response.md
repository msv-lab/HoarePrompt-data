Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `n` must be at least 0; `i` is incremented by 1; if `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0.**
