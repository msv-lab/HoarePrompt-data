### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of a game played by Alice and Bob on an array `a`, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` and Bob tries to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly computes the MEX under optimal play:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
    - The code initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
    - It then iterates through `arr` to populate `freq`.

3. **Finding the MEX**:
    - The code initializes a counter `cou` to zero.
    - It iterates through the frequency array `freq` from 0 to `n`.
    - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `arr`, it increments `cou`.
    - If `cou` reaches 2 (meaning two distinct numbers appear exactly once) or an integer `i` does not appear in `arr` at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Play**:
    - The strategy described in the code ensures that the first integer that appears exactly once or is missing from `arr` is chosen, which aligns with the goal of determining the MEX.
    - Since Alice and Bob play optimally, the MEX is effectively determined by the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or appears exactly once, which is exactly what the code computes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - The code handles cases where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1, 1]`), where the MEX is 0.
    - It also handles cases where all elements are distinct (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]`), where the MEX is `n`.
    - The code efficiently computes the MEX in `O(n)` time for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly computes the MEX under optimal play for Alice and Bob.
