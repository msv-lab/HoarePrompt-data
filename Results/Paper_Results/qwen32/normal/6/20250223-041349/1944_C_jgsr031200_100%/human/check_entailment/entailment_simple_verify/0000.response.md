### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics between Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` simply calculates the MEX of the given array without considering the turns and strategies of the players.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the frequencies to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `arr` (which is essentially the MEX of `arr`).
   - However, the code does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not account for their strategies.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `3 0 1 1`
     - Optimal strategy leads to a MEX of 2.
     - The code outputs 2, which is correct for the MEX of the initial array but does not simulate the game.
   - **Test Case 2**: `3 0 0 1`
     - Optimal strategy leads to a MEX of 1.
     - The code outputs 0, which is incorrect for the MEX of the final array `c` after optimal play.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and the strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - The MEX calculation alone is not sufficient to determine the final score given the optimal play by both players.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
