Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`, and `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `freq` list will contain the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list. Each position `i` in the `freq` list will hold the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the `arr` list. All other aspects of the initial state remain unchanged except for the `freq` list, which now accurately reflects the counts of each integer present in `arr`.
