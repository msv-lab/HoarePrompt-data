In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, but since `i` is the loop variable and gets assigned values by `range(int(input()))`, the key factor for the loop execution is the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `int(input())` should be at least 1. Since the loop uses `int(input())` directly, we need to adjust the state such that the input provided to `int(input())` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; the input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
