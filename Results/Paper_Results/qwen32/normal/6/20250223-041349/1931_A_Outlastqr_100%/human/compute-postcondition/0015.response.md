Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 52. `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `n` is greater than 27, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` equals 27, `word` is the string 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3].**
