To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions given for the value of `n` and how `word` is constructed based on these conditions.

### Analysis of Conditions:
1. **If \( n > 52 \)**:
   - `word` is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `n - 53` must be a valid index in this range (0 to 25).

2. **If \( 28 \leq n \leq 52 \)**:
   - `word` is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - Here, `n - 28` must also be a valid index in the range of `alphabet` (0 to 25).

3. **If \( n = 27 \)**:
   - `word` is simply `'aay'`.

4. **If \( 3 \leq n \leq 26 \)**:
   - `word` is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - `n - 3` must be a valid index in the range of `alphabet` (0 to 25).

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state, `n` is an integer read from input such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \). The exact value of `n` is not specified, so we need to cover all possible cases based on the value of `n`.

- **For \( n > 52 \)**:
  - `word` will be `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - For example, if \( n = 53 \), `word` will be `'a' + 'zz'` which is `'azz'`.
  - If \( n = 78 \), `word` will be `'z' + 'zz'` which is `'zzz'`.

- **For \( 28 \leq n \leq 52 \)**:
  - `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
  - For example, if \( n = 28 \), `word` will be `'a' + 'a' + 'z'` which is `'aaz'`.
  - If \( n = 52 \), `word` will be `'a' + 'z' + 'z'` which is `'azz'`.

- **For \( n = 27 \)**:
  - `word` is simply `'aay'`.

- **For \( 3 \leq n \leq 26 \)**:
  - `word` will be `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
  - For example, if \( n = 3 \), `word` will be `'aa' + 'a'` which is `'aaa'`.
  - If \( n = 26 \), `word` will be `'aa' + 'z'` which is `'aaz'`.

### Final Answer:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine a single specific output. However, based on the conditions, we can describe the possible outputs.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n as follows: if n > 52, word is alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'; if 28 <= n <= 52, word is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'; if n = 27, word is 'aay'; if 3 <= n <= 26, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3])**
