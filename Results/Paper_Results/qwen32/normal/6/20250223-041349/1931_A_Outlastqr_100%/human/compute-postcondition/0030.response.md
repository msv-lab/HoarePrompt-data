The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer value for `n` from the input. This overrides the previous value of `n` which was read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78. The other variables `t`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a new integer read from input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`.**
