The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 78 and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by the following rules: if `n` > 52, the string is the letter at index `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'; if 28 <= `n` <= 52, the string is 'a' followed by the letter at index `n - 28` in the alphabet and ending with 'z'; if `n` is 27, the string is 'aay'; if 3 <= `n` <= 26, the string is 'aa' followed by the letter at index `n - 3` in the alphabet.
