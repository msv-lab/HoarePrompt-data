Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 4*n + 4`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `index` has been updated by adding `n` to its previous value. All other variables retain their previous values.
