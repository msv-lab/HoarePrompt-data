Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`, `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps in the permutation, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is 0
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` must be greater than 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 and is now `remainder_steps - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is greater than 0 and is now `remainder_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
