### Reasoning:

The provided code is designed to solve the problem of determining the winner of a permutation game between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules specified. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness of the code:

1. **Input Parsing (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case with the extracted parameters and stores the results.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` computes the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score from the array `a` at each position.
   - It keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps to efficiently compute the total score without redundant calculations.

3. **Comparison and Result (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `calculate_score`.
   - It compares the scores and returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are printed correctly.

### Correctness:

The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, score calculation, and comparison accurately. The cycle detection and handling in `calculate_score` ensures that the score computation is efficient even for large values of `k`.

Therefore, the code is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
