Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Global variable `k` in `calculate_score`:** The function `calculate_score` uses a global variable `k` which is not defined within the scope of the function. This variable should be passed as a parameter to the function.

2. **Indexing in `calculate_score`:** The function `calculate_score` uses `current_pos - 1` to access elements in the `p` and `a` arrays. This is correct if `current_pos` is 1-based (as described in the problem), but the function does not handle the case where `current_pos` might go out of bounds. However, since `current_pos` is always within the range [1, n] due to the nature of the problem, this is less of an issue.

3. **Cycle detection and scoring:** The logic for detecting cycles and calculating the score within cycles is mostly correct, but the function should ensure that it handles the case where `k` is very large and the cycle detection and scoring are efficient.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score

def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version passes `k` as an argument to `calculate_score`, ensuring that the function has access to the number of turns. This should resolve the issues with the original program.
