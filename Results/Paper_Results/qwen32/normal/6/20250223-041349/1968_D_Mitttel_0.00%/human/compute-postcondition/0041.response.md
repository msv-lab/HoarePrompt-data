Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `9 + 4*n + 4 + n + n`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, the second being the value of `result`, and the third being the value of `result`.**

The only change in the output state is that the `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the value of `result`. All other variables retain their initial values.
