The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns; `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
