Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` (from the last iteration); `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (from the last iteration); `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]` (from the last iteration); `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]` (from the last iteration); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` (from the last iteration); `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` (from the last iteration); `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the last iteration

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least two values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the second value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least three values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the third value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
