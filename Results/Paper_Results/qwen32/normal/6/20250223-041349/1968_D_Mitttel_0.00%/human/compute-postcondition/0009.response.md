The code snippet `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` by converting the string at the position `index + 2` in the `data` list to an integer. Given that `index` is 1, `PB` is now assigned the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer representing the starting position of Sasha; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 1; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
