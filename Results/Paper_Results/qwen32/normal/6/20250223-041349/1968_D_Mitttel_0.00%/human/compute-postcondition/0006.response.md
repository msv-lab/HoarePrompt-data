The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop executes. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns; `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 1; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
