The function takes parameters representing the length of a permutation and array (`n`), the duration of the game (`k`), the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), a permutation list (`p`), and an array (`a`). It calculates scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal.
