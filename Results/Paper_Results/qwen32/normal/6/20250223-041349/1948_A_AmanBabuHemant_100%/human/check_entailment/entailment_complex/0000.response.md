### Reasoning:

1. **Odd `n` Case:** 
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved by repeating a pattern like 'AAB' which inherently creates an even number of special characters (each 'AAB' pattern contributes 2 special characters).

2. **Even `n` Case:**
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. Each 'AAB' pattern contributes exactly 2 special characters. Therefore, repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times will produce exactly `n` special characters.
   - The program then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. Since the maximum value of `n` is 50, the maximum length of `s` will be `50 // 2 * 3 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200. Therefore, the condition `len(s) < 200` will always be true for valid inputs, and the program will correctly output "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. It outputs "NO" for odd `n` and constructs a valid string with exactly `n` special characters for even `n`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
