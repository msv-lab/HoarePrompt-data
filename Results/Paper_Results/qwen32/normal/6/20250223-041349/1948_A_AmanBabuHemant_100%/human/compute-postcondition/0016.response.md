The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `t` and `n` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables.
2. The variables `t` and `n` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement.
3. Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'`, the output will always be `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
