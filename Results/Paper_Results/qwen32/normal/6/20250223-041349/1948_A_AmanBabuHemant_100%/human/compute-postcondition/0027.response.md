The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-2 <= 49, which implies that 2 <= t <= 51.
- `n` is an input integer (its exact value is not specified but it is used to define `s`).
- `s` is a string consisting of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

However, since the `print` statement does not use `t`, `n`, or `s`, these variables do not influence the output. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
