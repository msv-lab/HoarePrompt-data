The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` is an integer, and the string `s` will be composed of the sequence `'AAB'` repeated that many times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50; `n` is an input integer and `n` is even; `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
