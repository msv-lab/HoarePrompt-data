The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is also `float('inf')`, swapping them does not change their values. Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` remain as `float('inf')`.

Other variables (`l`, `c`, and `n`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
