The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of the other variables (`l`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `l[x]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l[x]` is greater than `b`**.
