Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
