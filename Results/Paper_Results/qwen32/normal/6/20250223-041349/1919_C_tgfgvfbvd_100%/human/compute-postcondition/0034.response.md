Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `x + 1`, if `a` was greater than `b`, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`, otherwise `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `a` is `l[x]`, `c` is `c + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `c` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions, except `c` which has been increased by 1.
