Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` is set to the original value of `b` and `b` is set to the original value of `a`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`, `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] > b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and if `a` was originally greater than `b`, `a` is set to the original value of `b` and `b` is set to the original value of `a`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1.**

To simplify, the overall postcondition can be described as:
**`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and if `a` was originally greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1.**
