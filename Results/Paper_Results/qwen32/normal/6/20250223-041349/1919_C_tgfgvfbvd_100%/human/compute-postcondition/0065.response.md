Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`, `b` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is updated to 1 or 2.**
