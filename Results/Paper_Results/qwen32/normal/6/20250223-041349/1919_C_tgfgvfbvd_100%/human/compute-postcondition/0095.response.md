Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `a` is `float('inf')` if `l[x] > b`, otherwise `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')` if `l[x] > b`, otherwise `l[x]`; `c` is 1 if `l[x] > b`, otherwise 0; `n` is greater than 0; `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b` if `l[x] <= b`.**
