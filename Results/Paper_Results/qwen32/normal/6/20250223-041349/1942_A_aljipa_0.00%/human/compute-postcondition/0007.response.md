Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**

In simpler terms, the variable `res` is updated based on the value of `k`:
- If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones.
- If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing just `-1`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
