Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by handling three specific cases based on the value of `k`:
1. If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones, which will indeed have `n` sorted cyclic shifts (since all elements are the same, all cyclic shifts are sorted).
2. If `k == 1`, it outputs an array consisting of numbers from `0` to `n-1`, which will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself).
3. For all other values of `k`, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it cannot find an array that satisfies the condition.

However, the program does not handle all possible values of `k` correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid array for values of `k` other than `1` and `n`. There are cases where `1 < k < n` for which a valid array exists, but the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for these cases.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 2`. A valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`. The provided program would incorrectly output `-1` for this case.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible values of `k`.

Correctness: **False**
