Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3 - 1\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `n` and `k` retain their input values.
- `res` is updated based on the value of `k`:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing a single element `-1`.
