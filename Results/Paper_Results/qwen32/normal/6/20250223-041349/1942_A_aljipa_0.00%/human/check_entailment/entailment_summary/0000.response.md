Reasoning:
The provided program handles the cases where `k` equals `n` and `k` equals `1` correctly according to the problem description. However, it incorrectly handles all other cases by outputting `-1` whenever `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.

Let's break down the logic:
- If `k == n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.
- If `k == 1`, the program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which is also a valid solution because only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
- For all other values of `k`, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because there are valid arrays for other values of `k` as well.

For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` because its cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted) and `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted), which satisfies `k = 2`.

Therefore, the program does not cover all valid cases for `k` and is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
