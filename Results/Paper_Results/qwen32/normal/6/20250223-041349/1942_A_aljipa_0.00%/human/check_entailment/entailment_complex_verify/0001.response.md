### Reasoning:

The provided solution addresses the problem by handling three specific cases:
1. **When `k == n`**: The solution outputs an array of `n` ones, which is trivially sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted. This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` (which is `n`) cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. **When `k == 1`**: The solution outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself. This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` (which is `1`) cyclic shift is sorted.
3. **When `1 < k < n`**: The solution outputs `-1`, indicating that no such array can be constructed. Although the problem doesn't specify how to construct such arrays, the solution's approach is reasonable because constructing such arrays is not straightforward and the solution correctly identifies this as an unsolvable case with the given logic.

The annotations provided in the annotated code correctly describe the state of the program at key points and the logic behind the solution. The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly and outputs the appropriate result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The solution correctly handles the specified cases and provides a reasonable response for cases where it cannot construct the required array.

### Final: **True**
