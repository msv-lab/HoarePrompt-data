You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The cyclic shifts of an array are all possible rotations of the array. If `k == n`, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted, implying that the array itself must be sorted. If `k == 1`, it means only one cyclic shift can be sorted. For other values of `k`, it's more complex to construct such an array, and the problem doesn't specify how to handle those cases, so the solution returns `-1` for those cases.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution handles the following cases:
- If `k == n`, it outputs an array of length `n` where all elements are `1`. This array is sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted, satisfying `k == n`.
- If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself, satisfying `k == 1`.
- For any other value of `k`, it outputs `-1`, indicating that no such array can be constructed.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the solution is correct for all possible inputs based on the problem statement:
- **Case `k == n`**: The solution outputs an array of all `1`s, which is sorted, and all cyclic shifts of this array are also sorted. This is correct.
- **Case `k == 1`**: The solution outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself). This is correct.
- **Case `1 < k < n`**: The solution outputs `-1`, which means it doesn't provide a valid array for these cases. However, the problem statement doesn't specify how to construct such arrays, and it's reasonable for the solution to return `-1` in these cases since constructing such arrays is non-trivial and not covered by the simple logic in the solution.

Given the problem constraints and the solution logic, the solution is correct for the cases it handles and reasonable for the cases it doesn't.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The solution correctly handles the specified cases and provides a reasonable response for cases where it cannot construct the required array.
