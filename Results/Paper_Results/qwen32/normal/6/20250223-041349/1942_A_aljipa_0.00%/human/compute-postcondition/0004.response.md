Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable indicates the number of test cases. However, it does not affect the output of the given print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input. This variable represents the length of the list `res`.
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input. This variable determines the type of the list `res`.
4. **`res`**: A list defined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k` equals `1`, then `res` is a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(*res)`. The `*` operator unpacks the list `res` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Determining the Output:
- **Case 1**: If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones. For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The print statement will output:
  ```
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- **Case 2**: If `k` equals `1`, `res` is a range object from `0` to `n-1`. For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `range(0, 5)`, which is equivalent to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The print statement will output:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Case 3**: If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, `res` is a list containing `-1`. Regardless of the value of `n`, `res` will be `[-1]`. The print statement will output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

### Final Answer:
Based on the value of `k`, the output will vary as described above. Here is the most precise description possible:

Output: **The elements of `res` unpacked and separated by spaces (where `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise)**.
