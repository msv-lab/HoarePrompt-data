Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but now `T - 1`, `t` is either `k % 2` (if `mi * 2 > k`) or modified in the if part, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than `mi * 2` and now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers, elements at indices `l` and `r` are modified based on the if or else conditions, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is determined based on the if or else conditions, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
