The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` modifies the value of `a[r]` by subtracting `mi` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[l]` has already been updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now updated to `a[r] - mi`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`.**
