Output State: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`**

Natural language: The value of `mi` is updated to be the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
