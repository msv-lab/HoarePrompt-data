Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[n - 1]` (which is `a[r]` before the decrement) is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `r` is `n - 1` and `ans` is 0. In both cases, `k` is `k - mi * 2`. `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
