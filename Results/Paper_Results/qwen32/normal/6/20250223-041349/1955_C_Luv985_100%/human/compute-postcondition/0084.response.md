Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers and the element at index `l` is reduced by `mi`, the element at index `r` is further reduced by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In simple terms, the value at index `r` in the list `a` has been reduced by `mi`. All other variables retain their previous values.
