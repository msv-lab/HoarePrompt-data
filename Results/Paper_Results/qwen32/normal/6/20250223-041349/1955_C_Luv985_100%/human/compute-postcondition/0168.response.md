Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are reduced by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is 0 unless `a[n - 1]` (which was `a[r]` before the decrement) is 0, in which case `r` is set to `n - 2` and `ans` is set to 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
