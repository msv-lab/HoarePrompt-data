### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: Find the best subarray to replace to maximize the sum.
- **Annotations**: The function iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates a sum (`sm`) that includes the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray. It then selects the subarray that maximizes this sum.
- **Issue**: The key issue here is that the function does not compute the MEX value of the subarray. Instead, it uses `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be calculated based on replacing the subarray with this MEX value.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: Generate a sequence of operations.
- **Annotations**: The function recursively appends operations to `ops`. However, the operations appended do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly generate the required operations. It seems to be appending operations without considering the actual MEX value or the effect on the sum.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- **Purpose**: Replace a subarray with its MEX value and generate operations.
- **Annotations**: The function appends several operations and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends an additional operation. It then replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray (`n`).
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value. Instead, it replaces the subarray with its length, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:
1. **Compute the MEX Value**: For each subarray, compute the MEX value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
2. **Replace Subarray**: Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
3. **Track Operations**: Track the operations performed to achieve the desired result.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The correct output is:
```
13 0
```
The provided code might not handle this case correctly because it does not properly compute the MEX value and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Final: False**
