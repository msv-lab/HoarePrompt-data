The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the indices `(i, j)` that maximize the calculated sum `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements before index `i`, the sum of elements after index `j`, plus the square of the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` inclusive.
