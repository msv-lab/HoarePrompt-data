Let's analyze the impact of the code snippet on the variables given the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`.
- `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

Given `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation to find `sm`:

- `sum(lst[:i])` becomes `sum(lst[:0])`, which is the sum of an empty list, so it equals 0.
- `sum(lst[j + 1:])` becomes `sum(lst[2:])`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `(j - i + 1) ** 2` becomes `(1 - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which equals 4.

Therefore, `sm` is calculated as:
\[ sm = 0 + \text{sum}(lst[2:]) + 4 \]

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `lst` remains a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` remain the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` remains the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` remains 0, `j` remains 1, and `sm` is now equal to the sum of elements in `lst` starting from index 2 to the end plus 4.
