Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, and `i` has completed its iterations
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If the current value of `sm` is greater than the previous `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to the current value of `sm` and `r` and `l` are updated to `i` and `j` respectively. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. If `sm > over_sum`, then `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `sm` (which is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`) is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `over_sum` is not updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
