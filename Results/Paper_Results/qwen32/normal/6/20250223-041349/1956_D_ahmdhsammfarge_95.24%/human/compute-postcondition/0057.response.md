Output State: **The program returns the indices `(r, l)` which represent the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm` from the list `lst`.**

Explanation: The program returns the indices `r` and `l` which were determined to give the maximum value of `sm` during the iterations over the list `lst`. Here, `i` was set to `len(lst) - 1` and `j` completed all possible iterations for this `i`. The values of `r` and `l` are the indices of the elements in `lst` that resulted in the highest `sm` value.
