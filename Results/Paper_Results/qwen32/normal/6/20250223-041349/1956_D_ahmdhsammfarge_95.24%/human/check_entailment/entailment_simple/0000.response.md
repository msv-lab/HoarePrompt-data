### Reasoning:

1. **Objective and Constraints**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing a series of operations where a chosen subarray is replaced by its MEX value.
   - The number of operations should not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the input array and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - `func_1(lst)` finds the indices `r` and `l` such that replacing the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with its MEX value maximizes the sum of the array.
   - `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)` performs the operation and updates the array and the list of operations.
   - After processing the subarray with the maximum potential sum increase, the program tries to replace any remaining zeros with 1s to maximize the sum further.

3. **Function Breakdown**:
   - **`func_1(lst)`**:
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced by its MEX value.
     - The MEX value is not explicitly calculated; instead, it assumes that replacing a subarray with its length squared (`(j - i + 1) ** 2`) will maximize the sum.
     - This assumption is flawed because the MEX value is not necessarily the length of the subarray squared. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and it could be much smaller than the length of the subarray.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
     - This function is supposed to recursively add operations to `ops` but is not used in the main logic.
     - It seems to be a redundant function that was not properly integrated into the main logic.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
     - It appends operations to `ops` and updates the subarray with the length of the subarray.
     - This step is incorrect because it does not use the MEX value but rather the length of the subarray.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any subarray.
   - The logic for maximizing the sum is flawed because it does not consider the actual MEX value but instead relies on an incorrect assumption about the sum increase.
   - The program does not minimize the number of operations, but it is supposed to ensure the sum is maximized within the allowed number of operations.

### Conclusion:
Given the flaws in the logic and the incorrect assumptions about the MEX value, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
