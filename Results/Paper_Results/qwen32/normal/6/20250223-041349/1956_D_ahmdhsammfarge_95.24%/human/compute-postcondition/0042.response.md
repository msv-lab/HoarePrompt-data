Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`, and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Natural Language: The values of `r` and `l` are updated to `[i, j]`, which are the indices that maximize `sm`. All other variables remain unchanged.
