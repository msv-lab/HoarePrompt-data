The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`. Since the loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration. The variable `i` remains the same unless it is modified outside the loop, which is not the case here based on the provided information.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken on a value such that the loop condition `j < len(lst)` is still satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `len(lst)`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If the current value of `sm` is greater than the previous `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to the current value of `sm` and `r` and `l` are updated to `i` and `j` respectively. `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(lst)`**
