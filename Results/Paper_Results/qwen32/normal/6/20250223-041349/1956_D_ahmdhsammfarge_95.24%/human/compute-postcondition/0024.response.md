Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`. The values of `r` and `l` have been updated to `i` and `j` respectively.**

In natural language: The indices `r` and `l` have been updated to the current values of `i` and `j`, respectively. All other conditions and values remain the same.
