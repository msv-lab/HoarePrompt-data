The code provided assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `r` will hold the value of `i` and `l` will hold the value of `j`. The other variables (`lst`, `over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
