To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and the range it depends on, specifically `i` and `len(lst)`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if the range `(i + 1, len(lst))` is non-empty. This means `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`.

Let's break down the requirements:
1. `i` is given as 0. Therefore, `i + 1` is 1.
2. For the range to be non-empty, `len(lst)` must be greater than 1 (since `1 < len(lst)`).

Thus, the list `lst` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

The other variables `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and the elements of `lst` (except for its length) do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

The adjusted state should be:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0**

This ensures that the loop can start executing by having a valid range for `j`.
