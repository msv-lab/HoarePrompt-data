Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to `sm`, which is the sum of the elements in `lst` from the beginning up to but not including index `i`, plus the sum of the elements from `j + 1` to the end of the list, plus the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
