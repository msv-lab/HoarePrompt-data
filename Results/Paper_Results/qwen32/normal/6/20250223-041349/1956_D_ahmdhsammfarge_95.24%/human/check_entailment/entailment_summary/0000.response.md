Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to determine if the program meets the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing a series of operations. Each operation can be described as choosing a subarray and replacing all its elements with the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide the sequence of operations used to achieve that sum.

### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array. It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates the sum of the array if the subarray from index `i` to `j` is replaced with its length squared, and keeps track of the subarray that gives the maximum sum.
   - **Output:** Indices `(r, l)` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is a recursive function that appends operations to the `ops` list. It seems to be designed to generate a sequence of operations, but the exact logic is not clear from the provided hints. However, it is not used directly in the main loop.
   - **Output:** Modifies `ops` list in place.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function replaces the subarray from index `r` to `l` with the length of that subarray, `n`, and appends the corresponding operations to the `ops` list.
   - **Output:** Modifies `lst` and `ops` list in place.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop repeatedly finds the subarray that maximizes the sum using `func_1` and then replaces it using `func_3` until no further improvement can be made.
   - After the main loop, it tries to replace any remaining `0`s with `1`s (which is a valid operation to increase the sum).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Maximizing the Sum:** The main loop correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum when replaced with its length squared. However, the logic to choose the MEX instead of the length squared is missing. The MEX should be calculated for the subarray, and the subarray should be replaced with this MEX value.
- **Operations Recording:** The operations are recorded correctly in the `ops` list, but the logic to choose the correct subarray and value to replace it with is flawed.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles arrays with single elements and arrays with all elements the same, but it does not correctly handle arrays with zeros or other values that can be increased by replacing with the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. It uses the length squared of the subarray instead, which is not the correct approach according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
