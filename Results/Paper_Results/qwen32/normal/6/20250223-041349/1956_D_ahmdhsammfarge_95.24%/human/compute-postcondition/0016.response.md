The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `r` becomes 0 and `l` becomes 2.

The other variables (`lst`, `over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2**.
