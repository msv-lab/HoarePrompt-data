Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) of that subarray. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
This function is supposed to find the subarray `[i, j]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array. However, the implementation is flawed:
- It calculates the sum of the array excluding the subarray `[i, j]` and adds `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to it. This does not correspond to replacing the subarray with its MEX.
- The MEX of a subarray is not `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. Instead, it should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- The function does not actually compute the MEX for any subarray; it incorrectly assumes that the MEX is the length of the subarray squared.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
This function seems to be intended to generate operations between indices `r` and `l`. However, it does not correctly generate the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray transformation:
- The function calls itself recursively, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements.
- It appends operations to the `ops` list, but these operations do not correspond to setting a subarray to its MEX.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
This function attempts to perform operations on the subarray `[r, l]`:
- It appends an operation to the `ops` list.
- It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and appends another operation if true.
- It then calls `func_2` to perform more operations.
- Finally, it sets the subarray to the length of the subarray `n` and updates the `lst`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions do not compute the MEX of subarrays, and the operations generated do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
