Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed and contains `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1]]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

Natural Language: The variables `r` and `l` remain integers within the specified range, and `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers. The list `ops` now contains three operations: `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added twice, and `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been added once. The variable `n` is assigned the value `l - r + 1`.
