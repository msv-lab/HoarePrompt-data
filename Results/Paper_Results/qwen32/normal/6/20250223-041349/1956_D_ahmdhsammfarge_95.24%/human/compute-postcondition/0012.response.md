The code snippet assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Therefore, `over_sum` will now have the value of `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is 0, `l` is 1, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `j` is 1**
