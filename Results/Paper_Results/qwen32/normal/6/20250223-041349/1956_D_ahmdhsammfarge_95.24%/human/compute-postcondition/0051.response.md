Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 0, `l` is 1, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[2 + 1:]) + (2 - 0 + 1) ** 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sm` has been recalculated to be the sum of the elements of `lst` from the start up to but not including index `i` (which is 0, so this sum is 0), plus the sum of the elements from `j + 1` to the end of the list (which is index 3 and onwards), plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged unless `sm` exceeds `over_sum`. The indices `i` and `j` also remain unchanged.
