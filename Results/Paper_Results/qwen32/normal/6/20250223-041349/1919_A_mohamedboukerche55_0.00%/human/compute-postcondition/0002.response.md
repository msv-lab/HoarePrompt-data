The code snippet `a = int(list(s.split())[0])` splits the input string `s` into a list of substrings, takes the first substring, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `a`. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the input string `s`, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, and `s` is the input string.**
