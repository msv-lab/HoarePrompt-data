The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` takes the input string `s`, splits it into a list of substrings, and then converts the second substring into an integer, assigning this value to `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new input string `s`
- `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new input string `s`
- `s` is the new input string
- `i` is `i + 1`

The value of `b` is updated by the code. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new input string `s` converted to an integer, `s` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `b` is now the integer value of the second substring of `s`. All other variables retain their initial values.
