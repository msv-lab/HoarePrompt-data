Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each of the `t` test cases, `s` is the input string, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of `s`, and `b` is the integer value of the second substring of `s`. The variable `i` is equal to `t` after the loop finishes. The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.**
