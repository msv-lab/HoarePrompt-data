You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `c` and `maxi` evolve based on the elements of the list `l`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `c` is initialized to 0.
   - `maxi` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `ele` in the list `l`:
     - If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`:
       - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
       - `c` is reset to 0.
     - Otherwise:
       - `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
       - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

The loop processes each element of `l` one by one, updating `c` and `maxi` accordingly. The final value of `maxi` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `l`.

**Output State after all iterations**:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over.
- `c` will be 0 if the last element of `l` caused `c` to reset to 0, or it will be the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers.
- `maxi` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `l`.
- `i` will be `len(l) + 1` because `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the loop iterates over each element of `l`.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `l`, `i` is `len(l) + 1`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `c` will be either 0 (if the last element caused a reset) or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list `l`. The variable `i` will be one more than the number of elements in the list `l`.
```
maxi = max(c, maxi)

```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. 
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
