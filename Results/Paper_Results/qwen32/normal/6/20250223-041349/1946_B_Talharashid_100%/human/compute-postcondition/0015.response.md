The code snippet sets the variable `c` to 0. This change affects the variable `c` directly, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `ele`, `maxi`) remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `c` is 0.**
