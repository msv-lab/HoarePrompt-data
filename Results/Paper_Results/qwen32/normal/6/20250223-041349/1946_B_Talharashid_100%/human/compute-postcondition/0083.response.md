The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current value of `c` with `maxi` and assigns the larger of the two to `maxi`. This means that if `c` is greater than `maxi`, `maxi` will be updated to the value of `c`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `maxi` will be updated if `c` is greater than the current value of `maxi`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `len(l)`, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers before the last negative number that was large enough to reset `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`.**
