The code snippet provided resets the variable `c` to 0. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `c` changes from its previous value to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ele` is an element of `l` that is less than 0, and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
