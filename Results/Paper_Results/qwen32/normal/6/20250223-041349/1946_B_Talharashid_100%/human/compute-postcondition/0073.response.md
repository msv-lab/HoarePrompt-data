The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by `ele`.**
