The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `c` is initially 0, after the execution, `c` will be equal to `ele`. The preconditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi` remain valid. The condition regarding `ele` and `c` also remains valid as the new value of `c` will be `ele`, which satisfies the given condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is equal to `ele`; `maxi` is 0; either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`**
