The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` have certain values or properties. The code only affects `n` and `k`, updating them with the values read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `k` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
