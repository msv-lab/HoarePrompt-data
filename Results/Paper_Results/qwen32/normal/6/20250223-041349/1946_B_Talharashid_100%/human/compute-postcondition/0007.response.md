The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. Given that the initial value of `maxi` is 0 and `c` is an integer such that `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` (which is less than 0), the value of `c` is non-positive. Therefore, `maxi` will remain 0 unless `c` is greater than 0, which is not possible given the conditions. Hence, `maxi` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `ele` is an integer that is less than 0; `c` is an integer such that `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; `maxi` is 0.**
