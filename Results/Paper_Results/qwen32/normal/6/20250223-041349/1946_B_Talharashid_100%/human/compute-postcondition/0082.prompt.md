Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is `len(l)`
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(l)`. If the current element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the larger value between 0 and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current one. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0; otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`. `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
