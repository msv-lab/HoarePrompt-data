Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `ele` is an element of `l` that is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains unchanged and `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.**
