The code snippet updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `c` is updated based on the previous `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`.**
