Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. The logic of the program revolves around finding the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using a variation of Kadane's algorithm. The formula `(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(a)) % 1000000007` is used to compute the final result for each test case.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of the program. The formula used to compute the final result is incorrect. The correct approach should involve understanding that the maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) to the array. The correct formula should be `(sum(a) + maxi * k) % 1000000007` if `maxi` is positive, as we can keep adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times. If `maxi` is non-positive, the best we can do is just the sum of the array itself, as adding non-positive sums will not increase the total sum.

The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible sum using `(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(a)) % 1000000007`, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
