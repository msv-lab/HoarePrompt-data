The given code snippet is `maxi = max(c, maxi)`. This line updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `ele` is the next element in the list `l`

The variable `maxi` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it holds some value prior to this line of code. After executing `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, the value of `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`**.
