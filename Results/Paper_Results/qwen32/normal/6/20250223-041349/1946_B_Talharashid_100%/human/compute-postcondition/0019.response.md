The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele` from the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ele` for the next iteration of the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop iteration.

Given that `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and at the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was some value from the list, for the next iteration, `ele` should be the next element in the list.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was the `i-th` element of the list `l`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `ele` should be the `(i+1)-th` element of the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**
