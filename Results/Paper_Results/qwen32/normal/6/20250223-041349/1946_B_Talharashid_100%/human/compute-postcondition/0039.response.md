The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current value of `c` with `maxi` and assigns the larger of the two to `maxi`. This means that `maxi` will now hold the maximum value between its previous value and the current value of `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `c` is `c + ele` (where `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`)
- `maxi` is 0
- `i` is incremented by 1

After the execution of the code snippet, the value of `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value of `c`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(c, 0)`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
