To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input.
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers.
- `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
- `i` is `len(l) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`2 ** k`**: This computes 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This multiplies the result of `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
3. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous step.
4. **`sum(l)`**: This computes the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
5. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This adds the sum of the list `l` to the result of the previous step.
6. **`% 1000000007`**: This takes the result of the previous step modulo 1000000007 to ensure the result fits within a certain range.

### Output Description:
The final output is the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. Given the initial state, we can describe the components as follows:
- `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in the list `l` or 0 if there are no non-negative numbers.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where maxi is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in the list l or 0 if there are no non-negative numbers, and sum(l) is the sum of all integers in the list l)**
