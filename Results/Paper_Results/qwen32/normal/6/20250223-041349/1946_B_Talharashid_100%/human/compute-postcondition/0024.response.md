Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
