The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This affects the values of `n` and `k`, but the other variables (`t`, `l`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `i` is `len(l)`**

In simpler terms: `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
