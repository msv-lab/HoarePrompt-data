Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, `maxi` is updated based on the previous `ele` and `c`**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged.
