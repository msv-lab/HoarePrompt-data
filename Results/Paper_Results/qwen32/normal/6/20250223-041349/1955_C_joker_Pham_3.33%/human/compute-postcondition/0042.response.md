The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `a[r]`, `a[l]`, `sunks`) remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, the current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`, the value of `a[l]` is now 0, `sunks` has been incremented by 1, and `l` has been incremented by 1.**
