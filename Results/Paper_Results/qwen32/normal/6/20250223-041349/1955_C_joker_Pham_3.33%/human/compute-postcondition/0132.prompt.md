Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` (or 0 if `a[l]` was originally 0), `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `k == a[r] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is not 0, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution continues. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is 0, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution continues.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is initially greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, or if `k` is 0, then `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain as per the initial conditions or `sunks` remains unchanged if `k` is 0. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, then `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, and `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` < `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In both cases where `a[r] < a[l]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
