Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 0. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
