Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` was 0, it remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `r` in the list `a`, unless `k` was initially 0, in which case it remains 0. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
