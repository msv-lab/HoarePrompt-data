To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `r`.

The loop condition is `l <= r`. This means the loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

Since `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `n - 1` will always be at least 0 when `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `r` (which is `n - 1`).

Thus, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop can execute the first time. The initial state already satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 0**
