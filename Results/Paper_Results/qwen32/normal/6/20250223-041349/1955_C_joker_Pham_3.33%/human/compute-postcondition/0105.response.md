Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to `r`; If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; Otherwise, the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `r` is decremented by 1.**
