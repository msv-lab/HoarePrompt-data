Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 minus `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is equal to or less than `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is set to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`; otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. In either case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`.**
