Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[r]`) satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged as per their initial state.
