Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `k` is decremented by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decremented by `a[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `k < a[l] * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
