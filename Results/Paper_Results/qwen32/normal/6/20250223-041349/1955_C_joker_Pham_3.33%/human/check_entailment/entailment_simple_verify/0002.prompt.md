You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task involves simulating the Kraken's attacks on a line of ships. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until it runs out of attacks or all ships have sunk. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. We need to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ship, respectively.
   - A variable `sunks` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The program enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.

3. **Attacking Ships**:
   - If `l == r`, the Kraken attacks the last remaining ship. If `k` is sufficient to sink this ship, it does so and increments `sunks`.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, the Kraken attacks the first ship. If `k` is sufficient to sink this ship and part of the last ship, it does so, adjusts the durability of the last ship, and increments `sunks`.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, the Kraken attacks the last ship. If `k` is sufficient to sink this ship and part of the first ship, it does so, adjusts the durability of the first ship, and increments `sunks`.
   - If `k` is not sufficient to sink the ships in the current attack, the loop breaks.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship.
   - It handles the case where `k` is not enough to sink any more ships.
   - It handles the case where there is only one ship left.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue in the program is that it does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ships in a single attack. Specifically, when `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2`, the program should decrement `k` by the appropriate amount and adjust the durability of the other ship accordingly. However, the logic for adjusting the durability and checking if the other ship sinks is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks in all scenarios. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ships in a single attack.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
