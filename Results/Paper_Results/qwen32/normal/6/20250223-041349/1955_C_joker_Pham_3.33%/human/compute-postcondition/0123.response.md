The code snippet `sunks += 1` increments the value of the variable `sunks` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
