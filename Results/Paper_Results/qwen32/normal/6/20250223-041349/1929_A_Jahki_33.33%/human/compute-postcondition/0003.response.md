Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. `order` is 1. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `order` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`a`, `num2`, and the condition about the list elements) remain unchanged.
