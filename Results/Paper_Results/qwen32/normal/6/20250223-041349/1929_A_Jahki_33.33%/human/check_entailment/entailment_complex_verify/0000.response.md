### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

#### Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (length of the array) and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function. If the array is in non-decreasing order, it prints `0` for the beauty, which is incorrect. Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if the array is strictly increasing. If the array is strictly increasing, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The function is flawed because it returns `True` when the array is in non-decreasing order, which should not prevent the calculation of beauty.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment is correct. The program contains a logical error because it incorrectly outputs `0` when the array is already in non-decreasing order. The beauty should always be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

#### Specific Case:
For the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The array is already in non-decreasing order.
- The `func_1` function returns `True`.
- The program outputs `0` instead of the expected beauty `2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it incorrectly handles arrays that are already in non-decreasing order by outputting `0` for the beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
