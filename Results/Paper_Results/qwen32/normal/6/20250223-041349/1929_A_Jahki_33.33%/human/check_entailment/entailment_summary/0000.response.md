Reasoning:
The given program is intended to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already strictly increasing using the function `func_1()`. If the array is already strictly increasing, the program prints 0, which is incorrect because the beauty can be calculated even if the array is not strictly increasing. However, the main logic of the program is correct for the case when the array is not strictly increasing. It sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The function `func_1()` correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing. However, the program's logic to handle the case when the array is strictly increasing is flawed. It should calculate the beauty even if the array is strictly increasing.

The program's logic to calculate the beauty of the array when it is not strictly increasing is correct. It sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Since the program does not handle the case when the array is strictly increasing correctly (it should still calculate the beauty), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
