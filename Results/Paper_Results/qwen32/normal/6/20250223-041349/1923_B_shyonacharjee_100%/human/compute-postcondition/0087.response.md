Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the new input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must have at least three tuples; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + 2 * health`; `(pos, health)` is the third tuple in the `monsters` list; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`**

Explanation: The value of `total_bullets_needed` has been updated to `bullets_used + health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
