Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is False; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`; and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.**

In simple terms, the variable `can_survive` has been set to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
