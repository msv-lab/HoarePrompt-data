Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least two tuples; `pos` and `health` are the values from the next tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `can_survive` is `False`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
