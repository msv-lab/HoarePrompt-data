The values of the variables do not change but the code breaks out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `pos` is `next_pos`; `health` is `next_health`; `distance` is `abs(next_pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `can_survive` is `False`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
