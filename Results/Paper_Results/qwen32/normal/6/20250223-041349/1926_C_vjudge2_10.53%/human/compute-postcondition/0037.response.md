The code snippet assigns the value of the last character of the string `word` to the variable `last`. Given that `word` is `"10"`, the last character is `"0"`, which when converted to an integer, becomes `0`. Therefore, the value of `last` is updated to `0`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 10**
