Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is 0**: This variable `t` is initialized to 0 but is not used in the provided print statement.
2. **`numbers` is `[20, 21]`**: This list contains two integers, 20 and 21.
3. **`values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and additional elements calculated as described**: The first 10 elements of `values` are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. Additional elements are not described explicitly, but we can infer that they are calculated based on some pattern or formula.
4. **`sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and additional elements calculated as described**: The length of `sum_values` is `max(numbers) + 1`, which is `21 + 1 = 22`. The first 10 elements are explicitly given as `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`. The additional elements are not provided in the initial state, but they are likely calculated based on some cumulative sum pattern.
5. **`total` is 45**: This variable `total` is set to 45 but is not used in the provided print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(sum_values[n])
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(sum_values[n])` depends on the value of `n`.
- The variable `n` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we need to infer its value or consider possible values.
- Since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `sum_values[n]` without additional information about `n`.

However, if we assume `n` is a valid index within the bounds of `sum_values` (i.e., `0 <= n < 22`), we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output Description:
The `print(sum_values[n])` statement will print the element at index `n` of the `sum_values` list. Given the initial state, the first 10 elements of `sum_values` are explicitly known. The exact value will depend on the value of `n`.

If `n` is between 0 and 9, the output will be one of the explicitly given values `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.

If `n` is between 10 and 21, the output will be one of the additional elements calculated as described but not explicitly given in the initial state.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is a valid index of the sum_values list, and sum_values[n] is the element at index n of the sum_values list)**
