Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing the number provided in each iteration of the loop; `values` is an empty list.**

Explanation: Since `t` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list. The expression `max(numbers) + 1` results in an error because `max()` cannot be applied to an empty list. However, to simulate the given code snippet without causing an error, we can infer that if `numbers` is empty, `values` should also be an empty list, as there are no elements in `numbers` to determine the range for `values`.
