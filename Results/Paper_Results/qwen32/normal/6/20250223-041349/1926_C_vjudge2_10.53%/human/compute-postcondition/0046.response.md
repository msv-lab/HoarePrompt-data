The code snippet `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` modifies the value at index `i` in the `values` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 11, `last` is 1, and `remainder` is 1. Therefore, `values[11]` is set to `values[1] + values[1]`.

From the initial state, `values[1]` is 1, so `values[11]` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, `values[10]` is 1, and `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is `"11"`, `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 11**.
