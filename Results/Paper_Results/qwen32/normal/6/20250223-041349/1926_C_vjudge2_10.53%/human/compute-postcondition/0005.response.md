The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` is not used within the loop body, we don't need to adjust its value. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `t` decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, decremented by 1; `numbers` is a list containing the single element `n`; `n` is an input integer.**
