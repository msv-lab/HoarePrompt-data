The code snippet `total += i` increments the variable `total` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 10 and `total` is initially also 10, the new value of `total` becomes 20. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i` (specifically, `values[10]` is 10); `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0` except the `i`-th element which is `i`; `total` is 20; `i` is 10**
