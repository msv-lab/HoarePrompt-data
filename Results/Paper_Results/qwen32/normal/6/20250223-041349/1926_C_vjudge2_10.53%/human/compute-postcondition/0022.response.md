The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` to the `i`-th element of the `sum_values` list. Given that `total` is 20 and `i` is 10, the 10th element of `sum_values` is now 20. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i` (specifically, `values[10]` is 10); `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0` except the `i`-th element which is `20`; `total` is 20; `i` is 10**.
