Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45; `total` is 45.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all 10 iterations:
- `t` remains 0.
- `numbers` remains a list containing `t` input integers (which is an empty list since `t` is 0).
- `values` will have the first 10 elements set to the numbers 0 through 9.
- `sum_values` will have the first 10 elements set to the cumulative sums: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.
- `total` will be 45, which is the sum of the first 10 non-negative integers.
