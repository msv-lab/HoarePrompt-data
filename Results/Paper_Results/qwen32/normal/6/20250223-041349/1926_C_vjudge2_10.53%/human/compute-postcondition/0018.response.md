The code snippet assigns the value of `total` to the `i`-th element of the `sum_values` list. Given that `total` is equal to `i`, the `i`-th element of `sum_values` will be updated to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i`; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0` except the `i`-th element which is `i`; `total` is `i`.**
