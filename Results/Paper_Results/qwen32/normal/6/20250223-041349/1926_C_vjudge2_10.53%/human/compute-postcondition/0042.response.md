The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, and `n` must be at least 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 11, and `n` must be at least 11.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 11**
