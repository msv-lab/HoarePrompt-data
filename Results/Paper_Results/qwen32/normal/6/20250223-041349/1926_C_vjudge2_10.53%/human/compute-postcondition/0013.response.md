The code snippet creates a list `sum_values` with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, where each element is initialized to `0`. The values of `t` and `numbers` remain unchanged, and `values` remains an empty list.

Since `numbers` contains `t` input integers, the length of `sum_values` will be the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initially set to `0`.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is an empty list; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`.**
