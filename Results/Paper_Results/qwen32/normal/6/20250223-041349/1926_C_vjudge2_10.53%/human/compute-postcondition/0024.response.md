The code snippet `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the `i`-th index of the `values` list. Given that `i` is 9, `values[9]` will be set to 9. The value of `values[10]` remains 10 as per the initial state, and no other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the 9-th element set to 9 and the 10-th element set to 10; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except the `i`-th element which is 20; `total` is 20; `i` is 9**.
