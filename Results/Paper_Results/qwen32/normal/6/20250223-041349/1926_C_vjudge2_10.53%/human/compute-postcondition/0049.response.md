To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and apply it iteratively from the given initial state and the states after the first few iterations.

The loop starts from `i = 10` and goes up to `n`. For each iteration, it calculates `values[i]` and `sum_values[i]` based on the last digit and the remainder of `i`. The `values[i]` is calculated by taking the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`, and `sum_values[i]` is calculated by adding `values[i]` to `sum_values[i - 1]`.

Let's continue the loop from where we left off and calculate the states for `i = 12` to `i = n`:

**Iteration for i = 12:**
- `word = "12"`
- `last = 2`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[12] = values[2] + values[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`
- `sum_values[12] = values[12] + sum_values[11] = 4 + 48 = 52`

**Iteration for i = 13:**
- `word = "13"`
- `last = 3`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[13] = values[3] + values[1] = 6 + 1 = 7`
- `sum_values[13] = values[13] + sum_values[12] = 7 + 52 = 59`

**Iteration for i = 14:**
- `word = "14"`
- `last = 4`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[14] = values[4] + values[1] = 10 + 1 = 11`
- `sum_values[14] = values[14] + sum_values[13] = 11 + 59 = 70`

**Iteration for i = 15:**
- `word = "15"`
- `last = 5`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[15] = values[5] + values[1] = 15 + 1 = 16`
- `sum_values[15] = values[15] + sum_values[14] = 16 + 70 = 86`

**Iteration for i = 16:**
- `word = "16"`
- `last = 6`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[16] = values[6] + values[1] = 21 + 1 = 22`
- `sum_values[16] = values[16] + sum_values[15] = 22 + 86 = 108`

**Iteration for i = 17:**
- `word = "17"`
- `last = 7`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[17] = values[7] + values[1] = 28 + 1 = 29`
- `sum_values[17] = values[17] + sum_values[16] = 29 + 108 = 137`

**Iteration for i = 18:**
- `word = "18"`
- `last = 8`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[18] = values[8] + values[1] = 36 + 1 = 37`
- `sum_values[18] = values[18] + sum_values[17] = 37 + 137 = 174`

**Iteration for i = 19:**
- `word = "19"`
- `last = 9`
- `remainder = 1`
- `values[19] = values[9] + values[1] = 45 + 1 = 46`
- `sum_values[19] = values[19] + sum_values[18] = 46 + 174 = 220`

**Iteration for i = 20:**
- `word = "20"`
- `last = 0`
- `remainder = 2`
- `values[20] = values[0] + values[2] = 0 + 3 = 3`
- `sum_values[20] = values[20] + sum_values[19] = 3 + 220 = 223`

Continuing this process up to `i = n`, we can generalize that `values` and `sum_values` will be updated accordingly for each `i`.

Assuming `n` is the maximum value in `numbers` and `n` is provided, the final state will be fully determined. For demonstration, let's assume `n = 20` for the sake of this explanation.

**Output State:**
- `t` is 0
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers
- `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, and additional elements calculated as described
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and additional elements calculated as described
- `total` is 45

Specifically for `n = 20`:
- `values` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 3]`
- `sum_values` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 52, 59, 70, 86, 108, 137, 174, 220, 223]`

Output State: **t is 0; numbers is a list containing t input integers; values is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 3]; sum_values is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 52, 59, 70, 86, 108, 137, 174, 220, 223]; total is 45.**
