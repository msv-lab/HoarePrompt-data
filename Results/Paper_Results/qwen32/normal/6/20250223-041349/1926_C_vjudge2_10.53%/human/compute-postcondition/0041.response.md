The code snippet `sum_values[i] = sum_total` updates the value of `sum_values` at index `i` with the value of `sum_total`. Given the initial state, `i` is 10 and `sum_total` is 46. Therefore, `sum_values[10]` is updated from 46 to 46, which does not change its value.

Since no other variables are modified by the code snippet, the output state remains the same except for the specific element in `sum_values` that was updated. However, since the value did not change, the output state is effectively the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 10**
