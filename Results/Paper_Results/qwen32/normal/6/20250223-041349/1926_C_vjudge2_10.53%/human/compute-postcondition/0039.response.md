The code snippet provided modifies the value of `values[i]` by setting it to the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `last` is 0
- `remainder` is 1
- `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are 0 through 9, and `values[i]` (where `i` is 10) is initially `values[last] + values[remainder]`, which is `values[0] + values[1]` or `0 + 1` which equals 1.

After executing the code snippet, `values[10]` will be recalculated as `values[0] + values[1]`, which remains 1. Therefore, the value of `values[10]` does not change from its initial value.

All other variables remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `values[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 10**
