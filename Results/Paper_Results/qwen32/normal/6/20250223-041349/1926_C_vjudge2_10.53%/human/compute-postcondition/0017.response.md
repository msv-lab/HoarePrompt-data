The code snippet `total += i` increments the variable `total` by the value of `i`. The previous value of `total` is 0, and after the operation, `total` becomes equal to `i`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i`; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`; `total` is `i`**.
