The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition provided, after this operation, `res` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `res` is either 1 or 2.**
