The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, this operation will remove that 0 from the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `pop` operation on the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list that contains at least one element and the last element of `a` is no longer 0 (it has been removed); `res` is 0**.
