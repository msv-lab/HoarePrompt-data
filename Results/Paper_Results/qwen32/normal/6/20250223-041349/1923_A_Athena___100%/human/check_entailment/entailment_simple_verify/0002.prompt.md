You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.

    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is 0; `n` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process; `a` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process; `res` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a ribbon with `n` cells, where each cell can either contain a chip (1) or be free (0).
- The goal is to move the chips such that they form a contiguous block, with the minimum number of operations.
- An operation consists of moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Initial Trimming:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of moves needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

3. **Counting Moves:**
   - The program then iterates through the trimmed list `a`. For each zero encountered, it increments the result `res` by 1. This step is based on the assumption that each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which is correct.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Initial Trimming:** This step correctly trims the unnecessary free cells from the start and end of the ribbon, as they do not affect the minimum number of moves required.
- **Counting Moves:** The logic of counting zeros in the trimmed list is correct because each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, and each such gap requires exactly one move to fill.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `1`
- Output: `1` (Correct)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
- After trimming: `1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Fourth Test Case:**
- Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
- After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
- Number of zeros: `2`
- Output: `2` (Correct)

**Fifth Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `3`
- Output: `3` (Correct)

Given the above analysis and verification, the program correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
