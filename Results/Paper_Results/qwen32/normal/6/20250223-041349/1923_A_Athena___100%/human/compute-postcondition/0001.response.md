The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will iterate, and since `t` is already given as an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), no adjustment is needed for `_`. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
