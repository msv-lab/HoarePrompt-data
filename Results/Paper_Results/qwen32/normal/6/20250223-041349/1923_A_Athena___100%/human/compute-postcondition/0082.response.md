Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element. If the current element `a[i]` is 0, `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
