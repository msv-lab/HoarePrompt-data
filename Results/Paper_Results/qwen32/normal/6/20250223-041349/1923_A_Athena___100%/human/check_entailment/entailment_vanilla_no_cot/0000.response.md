Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The current implementation counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chip, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of moves required.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to calculate the number of operations by considering the distance each chip has to move to fill the gaps between them. Here's an outline of a correct approach:

1. Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
2. Count the number of free cells within this range.
3. The number of operations required is equal to the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chip, as each free cell represents a necessary move for a chip to fill that gap.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        
        # Find the leftmost chip
        while left < n and a[left] == 0:
            left += 1
        
        # Find the rightmost chip
        while right >= 0 and a[right] == 0:
            right -= 1
        
        # Count the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chip
        res = a[left:right+1].count(0)
        
        print(res)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected code properly calculates the minimum number of operations required by focusing on the range between the first and last chip and counting the free cells within that range.
