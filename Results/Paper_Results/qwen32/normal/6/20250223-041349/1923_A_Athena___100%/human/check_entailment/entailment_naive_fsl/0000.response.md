Let's analyze the given program and determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)
```

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to move chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this should be determined. An operation consists of moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The program simply counts the number of zeros in the trimmed array (after removing leading and trailing zeros). However, this does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations needed to move chips into a contiguous block.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - **Input**: `8 \n 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
     - **Expected Output**: `1` (Move the chip at position 7 to position 5)
     - **Actual Output**: `2` (Counts the two zeros in the middle)

   - **Input**: `9 \n 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
     - **Expected Output**: `3` (Move chips at positions 2 and 7 to positions 4 and 5 respectively)
     - **Actual Output**: `4` (Counts the four zeros in the middle and between the blocks)

### Correctness
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. It overcounts the number of operations by simply counting the zeros in the trimmed array.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation
The program incorrectly counts the number of operations by simply counting the zeros in the trimmed array. It does not account for the correct number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single contiguous block. This can be seen in the example cases where the program's output does not match the expected output.
