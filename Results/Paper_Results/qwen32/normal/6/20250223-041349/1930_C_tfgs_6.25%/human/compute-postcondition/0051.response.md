To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the given loop and the conditions provided.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
```

From the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- `adv` must be at least 3 for the loop to run 3 times.
- `ans` gets appended with `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for each `j` in the range of `adv`.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `adv` is 0.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `adv` times.
   - For each iteration `j` in `range(adv)`, it appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - The loop will run `adv` times.
   - `ans` will have `adv` elements, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`.

Given that `a[i - 1]` is a constant value (since `i` is not being modified within the loop), let's denote `a[i - 1]` as `k`. Then, the elements appended to `ans` will be:
- `k - 0 - 1`
- `k - 1 - 1`
- `k - 2 - 1`
- ...
- `k - (adv - 1) - 1`

In summary, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain `adv` elements, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`.

**Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ans` will have `adv` elements, each being the value of `a[i - 1]` minus the current iteration index `j` minus 1.
