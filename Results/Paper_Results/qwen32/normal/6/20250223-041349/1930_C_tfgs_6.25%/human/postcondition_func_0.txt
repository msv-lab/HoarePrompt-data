The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, modifies the list by adding an incrementing value to each element, and then constructs a new list `ans` that contains a sequence of integers from the highest unique modified value down to 0, filling in any gaps with consecutive decreasing integers. The final list `ans` is printed.
