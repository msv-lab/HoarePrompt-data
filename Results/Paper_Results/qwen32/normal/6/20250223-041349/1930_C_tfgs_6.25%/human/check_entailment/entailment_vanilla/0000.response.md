Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We also have an empty set `S`.

2. **Operations:**
   - We perform `n` operations.
   - In each operation:
     - Choose an index `i` (1-indexed).
     - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
     - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - After `n` operations, `S` will contain unique elements.
   - We construct array `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.
   - We need to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

### Key Points:
- Since `S` is a set, duplicates are automatically handled.
- The goal is to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`. This means we should try to get the largest possible numbers in `S`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Transforming the Array:**
   - For each element `a[i]`, it computes `a[i] + i + 1` and stores it back in `a`. This step is incorrect because the problem specifies that the index `i` is 1-indexed, so the transformation should be `a[i] + i`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each transformed value.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates.
   - It sorts the unique values in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - It constructs the result array `ans` by iterating through the sorted unique values and adding the necessary elements based on the counts.
   - It handles leftover counts by appending the last element minus 1 until the desired length is reached.

### Issues in the Program:
- The transformation of `a[i]` is incorrect (`a[i] + i + 1` instead of `a[i] + i`).
- The logic for handling duplicates and constructing the final array seems correct, but it is based on an incorrect transformation.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect transformation of the array elements.

**Correctness: False**
