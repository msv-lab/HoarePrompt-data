The code snippet `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` modifies the `ans` list by appending a new value. The value being appended is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `adv` must be greater than 0.

The value `a[i - 1]` is the element at the index `i - 1` in the list `a`, which is `n - (i - 1)`. The expression `a[i - 1] - j - 1` thus becomes `n - (i - 1) - j - 1`, which simplifies to `n - i - j`.

The `ans` list will now contain the new value `n - i - j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `n - i - j`, `adv` must be greater than 0.**
