The code snippet `ans.append(a[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `a` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `i > 0`, `adv` is 0.
- `ans` contains `adv` elements where each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from `0` to `adv - 1`.
- `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.
- `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.

After executing `ans.append(a[i])`, the list `ans` will have an additional element, which is `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements plus `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**
