The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The values of `x`, `n`, `output2`, and the elements in `output1` before the reversal remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
