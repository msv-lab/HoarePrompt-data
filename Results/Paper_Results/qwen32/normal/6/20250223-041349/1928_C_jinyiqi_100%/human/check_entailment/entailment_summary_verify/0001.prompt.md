You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted such that divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` come first, followed by divisors less than the square root of `x` in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have a line of `n` people.
- People are assigned numbers in a repeating pattern based on `k`.
- The pattern starts from `1` to `k`, then back down to `2` (excluding `k`), and repeats.
- The pattern length is `2k - 2`.
- Given Vasya's position `n` and assigned number `x`, we need to find all possible `k` values that fit this pattern.

#### Key Observations:
- The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- For Vasya's position `n` and number `x`, we need to determine if there exists a `k` such that Vasya's position `n` maps to number `x` in the pattern.
- The position `n` in the pattern can be reduced modulo `2k - 2` to find its equivalent position in the first cycle.
- The number `x` can be either in the increasing part (`1` to `k`) or the decreasing part (`k-1` to `2`).

#### Approach:
- The code attempts to find all `k` values that satisfy the conditions by checking two possible scenarios:
  1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
  2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
- For each scenario, it finds divisors of the respective expression and checks if they can form valid `k` values.
- The function `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number.
- The code then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The function `func_1` returns divisors in a specific order, but the filtering logic does not correctly handle all cases.
- The logic for checking valid `k` values is flawed. It should correctly map the position `n` to the pattern and verify if `x` is the assigned number.
- The code does not account for the fact that `k` must be greater than `x` in the increasing part and `k - x + 1` in the decreasing part.

#### Correctness:
Given the above observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values. It incorrectly filters divisors and does not correctly map positions to numbers in the pattern.

### Correctness: **False**
