Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Unresolved Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called, but it is defined after it is used. In Python, functions need to be defined before they are called.

2. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not directly related to the problem's logic. The problem requires checking the periodicity of the sequence and whether the given `x` can be the `n`-th element in the sequence for different `k` values.

3. **Logic for Finding `k`**: The logic for finding the correct `k` values is not correctly implemented. The program should check whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the sequence for different `k` values.

4. **Handling of `k` Values**: The program should iterate over possible `k` values and check if the sequence generated by `k` results in `x` at position `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_k_values(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1 and position_in_period + 1 == x:
            count += 1
        elif position_in_period >= k - 1 and 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_k_values(n, x))
```

This corrected program defines a function `find_k_values` that iterates over possible `k` values, calculates the position in the period, and checks if it matches the given `x`. The main part of the program then calls this function for each test case.
