Output State: **`num` is `[[3, 5, [1, 2, 3]]]`, `counter` is 0, and `num[i]` is not equal to `'0'`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `num` and `counter` remain unchanged, and the condition `num[i]` is not equal to `'0'` still holds true. The program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
