Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code is as follows:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Function Summary
The function `func` processes each test case by iterating over possible values of `b` and calculating a value `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. It adds `x` to the sum `suma` and checks for additional conditions to add more to `suma`. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the code is incorrect due to the following reasons:
1. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly reflect the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. The arbitrary subtraction of `2` from `suma` does not align with the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis

The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic for checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it uses a complex formula that does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.

Let's consider the correct approach:
- For each pair `(a, b)`, compute `gcd(a, b)`.
- Check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses an incorrect formula and an arbitrary subtraction, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
