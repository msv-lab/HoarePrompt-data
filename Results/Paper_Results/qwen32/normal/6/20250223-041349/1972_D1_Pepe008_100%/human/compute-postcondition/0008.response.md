The code snippet provided is:

```python
suma += x
```

This line of code adds the value of `x` to the variable `suma`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `info` is a list of strings from the input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `suma` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is `a + 1`.

After executing `suma += x`, the value of `suma` changes to `0 + x`, which is simply `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `a + 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`.**
