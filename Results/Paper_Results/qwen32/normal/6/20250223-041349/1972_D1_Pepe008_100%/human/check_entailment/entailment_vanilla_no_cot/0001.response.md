To determine the correctness of the given program, let's first analyze the problem and the program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Mathematical Insight:
For the condition \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can simplify the condition as follows:
Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \Rightarrow x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \Rightarrow x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, \(k \cdot d - 1\) must be coprime with \(y\). This means for each \(y\), we need to find the number of valid \(x\) such that \(1 \leq dx \leq n\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the given program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```
The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) (renamed as `i` in the loop) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the mathematical insight derived above. The formula used for `x` and the conditions inside the loop do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a different approach that does not match the mathematical conditions necessary for the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
