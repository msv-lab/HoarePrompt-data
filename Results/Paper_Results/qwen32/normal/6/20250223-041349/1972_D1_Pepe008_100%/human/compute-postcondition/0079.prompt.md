Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; T is an input integer; n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suma` is the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, plus any additional 1s added based on the specified conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: suma is 16, t is incremented by 1 and is less than T, info is a list of strings, a is the integer value of info[0], b is the integer value of info[1] and b is at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values and additional 1s where the specific condition is met, `t` is 3, `T` is greater than `t`, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
