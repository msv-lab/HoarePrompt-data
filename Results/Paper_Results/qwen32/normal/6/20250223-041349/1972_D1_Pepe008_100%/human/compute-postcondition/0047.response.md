The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `suma`. The other variables (`t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `suma` will be the sum of its previous value and `x`.

Output State: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
