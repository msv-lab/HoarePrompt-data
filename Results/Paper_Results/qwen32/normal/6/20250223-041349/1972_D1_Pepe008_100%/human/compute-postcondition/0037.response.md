Postcondition: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is further incremented by 1. `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`. `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1. `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, taking into account the conditions and changes specified in the if part.
