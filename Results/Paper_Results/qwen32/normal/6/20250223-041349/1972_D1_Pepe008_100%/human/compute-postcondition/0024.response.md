Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 6) // 3`. If `(a - 6) % 3` is not zero, then the condition `(a - 6) // 9 + 1 > 0` is checked. If true, the program proceeds as described in the if part. If the condition is false, there is no change as there is no else part.**

To simplify, the postcondition can be summarized as:
Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 6) // 3`. The condition `(a - 6) // 9 + 1 > 0` is checked, and if true, the program executes the if part. If the condition is false, there is no change.**
