Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, and then use the annotated version to evaluate its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using the following logic:
1. For each test case, read the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
2. Initialize a sum `suma` to 0.
3. Iterate over each possible value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
4. For each \(b\), compute a value \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
5. If the computed \(x\) is positive, add it to `suma`.
6. Check additional conditions related to divisibility and add 1 to `suma` if met.
7. Print `suma - 2`.

### Annotations
The annotations provide a step-by-step description of the program's state and logic, but they do not explicitly verify the correctness of the logic applied to solve the problem.

### Evaluation
Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Iterating over \(b\):** The code correctly iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Computing \(x\):** The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not directly relate to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Adding \(x\) to `suma`:** The condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\) does not ensure that the pair \((a, b)\) satisfies the problem's condition.
4. **Additional checks:** The conditions \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\) are not directly related to the problem's condition.
5. **Subtracting 2:** The final subtraction of 2 from `suma` is not justified by the problem description.

### Test Case Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \((a, b) = (1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 * \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- For \((a, b) = (2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 * \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- For \((a, b) = (2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 * \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The provided code does not correctly count these pairs and will likely produce an incorrect result for this test case.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula and conditions used in the code do not accurately reflect the requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Final: False**
