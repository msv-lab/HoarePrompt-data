### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem, the provided code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a loop over possible values of \(b\) and calculating a value \(x\) based on a specific formula. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Looping Through Values of \(b\):**
   - The code iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid \(a\) for Each \(b\):**
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an additional 1 to the sum.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the logic to determine if an additional 1 should be added do not correctly reflect the problem's conditions.
- The code does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end of the sum calculation is not justified by the problem statement or the logic in the code.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not provide any validation of the logic used in the code. They simply state the values of variables and the final output calculation without verifying the correctness of the logic.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using a nested loop, but the logic for checking the condition must be correct.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the provided code's logic and formula, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
