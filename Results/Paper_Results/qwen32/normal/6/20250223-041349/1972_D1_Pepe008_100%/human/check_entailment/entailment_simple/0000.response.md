Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code seems to implement a solution based on iterating over possible values of \(b\) and then calculating a value \(x\) which is supposed to contribute to the count of valid pairs. However, the logic in the code does not directly match the problem description.

#### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Inner Calculation**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
3. **Condition Check**: Checks if \(x > 0\) and adds \(x\) to `suma`. Additionally, it checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an extra 1 to `suma`.
4. **Final Adjustment**: Prints `suma - 2`.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The code does not directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The logic for calculating \(x\) and the conditions for adding to `suma` do not align with the problem requirements.
- The final adjustment of subtracting 2 from `suma` is unclear and not explained in the code comments.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Given the constraints, a direct approach might be inefficient, and optimizations may be needed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It uses a different and potentially incorrect logic to calculate the number of valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
