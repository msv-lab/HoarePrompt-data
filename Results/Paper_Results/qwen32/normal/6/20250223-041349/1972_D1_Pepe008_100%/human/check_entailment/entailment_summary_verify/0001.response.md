### Reasoning

Let's revisit the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this by iterating through possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and calculating a value \(x\) based on a specific formula. The key part of the code is:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
print(suma - 2)
```

#### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary indicates that the function calculates a specific sum based on the formula and outputs the result minus 2. However, the summary does not provide enough detail to confirm the correctness of the logic.

#### Issues with the Code
1. **Logic for \(x\)**: The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not directly relate to the problem's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The code seems to be using a heuristic or a different approach that is not immediately clear from the problem statement.
2. **Additional Condition**: The condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) is also not clearly justified by the problem requirements.
3. **Subtraction of 2**: Subtracting 2 from the final sum is not explained and does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using a nested loop, but the logic for checking the condition must be correct.

#### Verification
Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The logic and the formula used do not align with the problem statement, and the subtraction of 2 at the end is unjustified.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
