Let's break down the impact of the code on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a list of strings from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 2
- `x` is `a + 1`

The code snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Given `i` is 2, we can substitute `i` in the equation:

```python
x = (a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1
x = (a - 2 * 1) // 4 + 1
x = (a - 2) // 4 + 1
```

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`**.
