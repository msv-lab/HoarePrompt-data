To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Solution Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic seems flawed and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes a counter `suma` to zero.
4. It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
5. For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using a formula that seems to be an attempt to count valid \(a\) values.
6. It adds \(x\) to `suma` if the condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\) is satisfied.
7. It adds an additional 1 to `suma` if two specific conditions are met, which do not align with the problem's requirements.
8. It prints `suma - 2` as the result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the additional conditions do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.
2. **Hardcoded Adjustments**: The subtraction of 2 from `suma` before printing the result is arbitrary and does not account for the actual number of valid pairs.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for counting valid pairs does not properly consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done efficiently using nested loops and the `math.gcd` function.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
