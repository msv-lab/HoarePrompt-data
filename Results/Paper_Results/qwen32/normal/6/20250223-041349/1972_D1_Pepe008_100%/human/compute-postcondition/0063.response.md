Postcondition: **`suma` is `suma + x`, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is further incremented by 1. `t` is 3, `T` is greater than 3, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if part and the absence of an else part.
