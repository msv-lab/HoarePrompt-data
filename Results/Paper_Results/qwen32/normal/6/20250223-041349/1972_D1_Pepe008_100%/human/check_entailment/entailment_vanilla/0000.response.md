To determine if the given program is correct, let's first analyze the problem statement and the solution provided in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a nested loop approach. However, the logic in the code seems to be incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case's input values \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Looping Through Values of \(b\):**
   - The code iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid \(a\) for Each \(b\):**
   - The code calculates a value \(x\) based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), where \(i\) is the loop variable representing \(b\).
   - It checks if this value is positive and adds it to the sum.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an additional 1 to the sum.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

### Issues with the Code
- The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the logic to determine if an additional 1 should be added do not correctly reflect the problem's conditions.
- The code does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end of the sum calculation is not justified by the problem statement or the logic in the code.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using a nested loop, but the logic for checking the condition must be correct.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the provided code's logic and formula, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
