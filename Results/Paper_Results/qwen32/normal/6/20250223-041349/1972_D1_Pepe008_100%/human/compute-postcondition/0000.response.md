T is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; T is an input integer; n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
