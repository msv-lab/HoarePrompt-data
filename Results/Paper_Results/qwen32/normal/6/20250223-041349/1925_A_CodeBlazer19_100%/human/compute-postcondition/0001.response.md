The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` are mentioned as part of the description of the test cases but are not directly involved in the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `t` is already specified to be such that 1 <= t <= 676, which means the loop will execute at least once by default.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state of `t` is necessary for the loop to execute. The state of `i` is managed by the loop itself, starting from 0 up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676**
