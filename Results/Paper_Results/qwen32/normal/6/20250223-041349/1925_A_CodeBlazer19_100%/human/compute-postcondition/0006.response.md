Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- `i` is `i + 1` (However, `i` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **String Slicing**: The expression `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` slices the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` from the start up to (but not including) the `k`-th character. This means it will return the first `k` characters of the alphabet.
2. **Repetition**: The sliced string is then repeated `n` times using the `* n` operation.

### Output:
The output will be a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.

### Example:
- If `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the output will be `'abcabc'` because the first 3 letters of the alphabet are `'abc'`, and repeating them 2 times results in `'abcabc'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times**.
