To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the structure of the loop.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and prints the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

### Loop Execution:
- **Iteration 1**: Reads `n1` and `k1`, prints the first `k1` letters of the alphabet repeated `n1` times.
- **Iteration 2**: Reads `n2` and `k2`, prints the first `k2` letters of the alphabet repeated `n2` times.
- **Iteration 3**: Reads `n3` and `k3`, prints the first `k3` letters of the alphabet repeated `n3` times.
- ...
- **Iteration t**: Reads `nt` and `kt`, prints the first `kt` letters of the alphabet repeated `nt` times.

After the loop completes all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will have taken on the values from `0` to `t-1` and will have reached `t` at the end of the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same, as it is the number of test cases and does not change during the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes all iterations.
- The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration, i.e., `nt` and `kt` respectively.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` hold the values from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations are completed, `t` still represents the total number of test cases, `i` will be equal to `t` (since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`), and `n` and `k` will be the values from the last test case.
