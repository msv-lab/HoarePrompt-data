To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: The number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4).
   - `n`: The number of elements in the array `arr` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5).
   - `a`: A list of integers (1 <= a_i <= n).
   - `arr`: The array of integers obtained from the input.
   - `flag`: True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False.
   - `ans`: Initialized to Decimal('Infinity').
   - `val`: The first element of `arr`.
   - `cnt`: Initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the variable `i`.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

3. **After Loop Completion:**
   - After the loop, `cnt` will hold the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`.
   - `ans` will hold the minimum length of sequences of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found during the loop.
   - `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the array).

Now, let's determine the final output state after all iterations:

- `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag` remain unchanged.
- `val` remains the first element of `arr`.
- `ans` will be the minimum length of sequences of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`.
- `cnt` will be the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`.
- `i` will be `n-1`.

**Output State: **t** is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `ans` is the minimum length of sequences of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`; `i` is n-1.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will be the smallest number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element `val`, and `cnt` will be the count of the last such sequence. The loop index `i` will be the last index of the array `arr`.
