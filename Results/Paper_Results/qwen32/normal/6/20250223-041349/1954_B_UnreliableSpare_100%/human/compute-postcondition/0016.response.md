To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and for each iteration, it checks if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]`. If it finds any such pair, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means all elements in `arr` are the same, and `flag` remains `True`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that `arr[1] == arr[0]`, `arr[2] == arr[1]`, and `arr[3] == arr[2]`. If the loop continues to iterate without finding any differing elements, it will complete all iterations, and `flag` will remain `True`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be:

- `t` remains the same integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `a` remains the same list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
- The given array `a` remains beautiful.
- `arr` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, it will be `False`.

Since the problem specifies that the array `a` is beautiful and the loop's behavior does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or the condition of `a` being beautiful, the only variable that could change is `flag`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an input integer; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array a is beautiful; arr is a list of integers obtained from the input; flag is True if all elements in arr are the same, otherwise False.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are identical, otherwise it is `False`.
