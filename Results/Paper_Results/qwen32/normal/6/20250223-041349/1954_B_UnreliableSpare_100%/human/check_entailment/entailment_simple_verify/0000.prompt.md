You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The program incorrectly handles certain cases, particularly when there are multiple segments of different elements in the array.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of a contiguous segment of the same elements (`ans = min(ans, cnt)`). This is not necessarily the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find the minimum segment length as `1` (for the `5`), but removing just the `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, you need to remove at least three `3`s to break the beauty.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - The program correctly identifies uniform arrays (where all elements are the same) and returns `-1` as expected. However, the logic for non-uniform arrays is flawed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

- The program will output `1` because it identifies the segment of `5` as the shortest segment.
- However, removing just the `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer should be `3`, as removing any three `3`s will break the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to break the array's beauty by removing the minimum number of elements. This involves more complex logic to evaluate different segments and their removal impacts.

Given the above issues, the program is incorrect.
