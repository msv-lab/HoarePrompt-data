The code snippet provided simply sets the variable `flag` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is False; `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`**.
