Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5
- The given array `a` is beautiful
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False
- `val` is the first element of `arr`
- `i` is 2
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans = min(ans, cnt)
```

The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'). After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to `min(Decimal('Infinity'), 2)`, which is `2`.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to `min(0, 0)`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the updated state of `ans` will be either `2` or `0` based on the initial conditions of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is 2; If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
