You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers from the input. It then determines if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of contiguous subsequences in `arr` where all elements are the same.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if the Array is Homogeneous**:
   - The program initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.

3. **Finding the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`, which will store the minimum length of segments of identical elements.
   - It then iterates through the array to find segments of identical elements and keeps track of the length of these segments. When a segment ends, it updates `ans` with the minimum segment length found so far.
   - Finally, it checks the last segment after the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - If the `flag` is `True`, meaning the array is homogeneous (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because no removal can make it non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Homogeneous Array**:
  - If the array is homogeneous, the flag will be `True`, and the program correctly returns `-1`.
  
- **Non-Homogeneous Array**:
  - For a non-homogeneous array, the program attempts to find the smallest segment of identical elements. However, this approach is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which is not necessarily the length of the smallest segment of identical elements.
  - Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The smallest segment of identical elements is `[5]` with length `1`. However, removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array non-beautiful. Instead, we need to remove the three `3`s around the `5` to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The current approach does not account for the need to disrupt the "beautiful" property by removing elements in a way that prevents the described operations from making all elements the same.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It incorrectly assumes that the smallest segment of identical elements is the answer, which is not always true.
