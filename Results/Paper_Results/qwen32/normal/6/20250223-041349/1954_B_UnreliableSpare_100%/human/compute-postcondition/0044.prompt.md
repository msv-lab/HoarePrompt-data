You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The given array a is beautiful.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an input integer; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array a is beautiful; arr is a list of integers obtained from the input; flag is True if all elements in arr are the same, otherwise False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: t
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt)
    #State: `t` is unchanged; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `flag` is True, it remains True. Otherwise, `flag` is set to False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the predefined constraints and conditions related to the integer `t`, the integer `n`, and the list `a` for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, it processes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where `a` is described as "beautiful". The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
