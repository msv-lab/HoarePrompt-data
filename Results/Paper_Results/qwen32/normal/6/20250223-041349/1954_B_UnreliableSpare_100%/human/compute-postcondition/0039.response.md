The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `ans`, or `flag`. The statement directly prints the integer `-1`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is unchanged (though its value is not specified).
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` (though neither `ans` nor `cnt` is specified).
- `flag` is `True` (though it is not used in the print statement).

Since the print statement is `print(-1)`, the output will simply be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
