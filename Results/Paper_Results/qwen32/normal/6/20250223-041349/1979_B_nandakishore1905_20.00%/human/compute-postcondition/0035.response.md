Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are new input integers.
- `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2:
  - `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
  - `p` is the length of `l`.
  - `q` is 2.
  - `i` is incremented by 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
   - Specifically, `k = abs(n - m)`.

2. **Check if `k` is a power of 2:**
   - The code snippet does not affect the value of `k` directly; it only calculates `k` and then checks if it is not a power of 2 to perform additional calculations.
   - However, the `print` statement only outputs `k` regardless of whether `k` is a power of 2 or not.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is `abs(n - m)`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **abs(n - m)**
