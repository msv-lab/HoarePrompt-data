Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `n == 0` and `m % 2 == 0`, no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.**
