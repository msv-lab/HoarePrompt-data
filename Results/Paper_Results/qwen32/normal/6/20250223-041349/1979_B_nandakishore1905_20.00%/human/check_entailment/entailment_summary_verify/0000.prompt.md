You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers, and prints a specific value based on the relationship between the two integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and applies different logic to determine the output value, which is then printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) for all possible values of \(x\) and \(y\). Let's analyze the code and the problem description to identify the issues.

The logic in the provided code seems to be based on the observation that the longest common subsegment length can be derived from the bitwise XOR of \(x\) and \(y\). However, the implementation is flawed and does not cover all edge cases correctly.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling the XOR Result**: The code uses the XOR result \(k = abs(n - m)\) and checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 to determine the length of the longest common subsegment. This logic is incorrect because the length of the longest common subsegment is not directly related to whether \(k\) is a power of 2.

2. **Special Cases**: The code handles special cases where \(n = 0\) and \(m\) is odd or even. These special cases are not generally correct and do not cover all scenarios.

3. **General Case**: The general case where \(n\) and \(m\) are arbitrary non-zero and distinct values is not handled correctly. The logic used to compute the length of the longest common subsegment is incorrect.

To illustrate the incorrectness, let's consider a test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
1 2
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
1
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
1
2
```

For the second test case (\(x = 3\) and \(y = 5\)), the XOR result is \(3 \oplus 5 = 6\). The code incorrectly computes the length of the longest common subsegment as 2, but the correct answer is 1.

To fix the code, we need to correctly compute the longest common subsegment length by comparing the sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) directly. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 0
        for n in range(1, 1000000):  # Arbitrarily large range to find the longest common subsegment
            a_n = n ^ x
            b_n = n ^ y
            if a_n == b_n:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 0
        print(max_length)

func()
```

This corrected code iterates through the sequences and finds the longest common subsegment by comparing the elements directly. However, the original code does not follow this approach and is therefore incorrect.
