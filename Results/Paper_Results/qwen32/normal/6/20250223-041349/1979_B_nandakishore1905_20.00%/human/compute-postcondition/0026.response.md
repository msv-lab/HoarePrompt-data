Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `q` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `p` has been updated to be the length of the binary string `l`. All other variables retain their initial values.
