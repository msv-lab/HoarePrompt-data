The code snippet `p = len(l)` recalculates the length of `l`, which is the binary representation of `k` (the absolute value of `n - m`). However, since `p` was already defined as the length of `l` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `p`. Therefore, no variables are actually altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1.**
