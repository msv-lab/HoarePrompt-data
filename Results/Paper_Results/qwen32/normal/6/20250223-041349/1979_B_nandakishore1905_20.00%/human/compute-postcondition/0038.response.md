The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1.**
