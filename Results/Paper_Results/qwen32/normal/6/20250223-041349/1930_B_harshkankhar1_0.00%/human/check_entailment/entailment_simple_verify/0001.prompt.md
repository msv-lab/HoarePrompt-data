You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) for which both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution generates a permutation by reversing the even-indexed elements of the list \( a \) which is initially a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))  # Create a list [1, 2, ..., n]
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]  # Reverse the elements at even indices (0-based)
    print(a)
```

#### Example Walkthrough

1. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   4
   3
   ```

2. **Processing for n=4:**
   - Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Elements at even indices (0-based): `[1, 3]` (reversed to `[3, 1]`)
   - Resulting list: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`

3. **Processing for n=3:**
   - Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Elements at even indices (0-based): `[1, 3]` (reversed to `[3, 1]`)
   - Resulting list: `[3, 2, 1]`

#### Verification of the Solution

To verify if the solution meets the problem's requirements, we need to check if there are any pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

- **For n=4:**
  - Permutation: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`
  - Check pairs:
    - \( (i, j) = (1, 2) \): \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) does not divide \( 4 \)
    - \( (i, j) = (1, 3) \): \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) does not divide \( 4 \)
    - \( (i, j) = (2, 3) \): \( 2 \) does not divide \( 4 \) and \( 1 \) does not divide \( 4 \)

- **For n=3:**
  - Permutation: `[3, 2, 1]`
  - Check pairs:
    - There are no valid pairs \( (i, j) \) to check as \( n < 4 \).

### Conclusion

The provided solution generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for the provided examples. However, it is not guaranteed to work for all possible values of \( n \). For instance, if \( n \) is such that reversing the even-indexed elements results in a permutation that still has the property that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for some \( i \) and \( j \), the solution would be incorrect.

Therefore, while the solution works for the examples provided, it is not a general solution for all \( n \).
