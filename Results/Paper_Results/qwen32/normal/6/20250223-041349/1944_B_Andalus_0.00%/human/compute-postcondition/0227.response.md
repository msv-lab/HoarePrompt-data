The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Since the increment of `sz` does not affect the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement, the state of those conditions also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains at least one unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
