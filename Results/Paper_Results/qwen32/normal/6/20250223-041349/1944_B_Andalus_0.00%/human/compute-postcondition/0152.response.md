Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.**
