To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is used.

### Analysis of the Initial State:

1. **`lft`**: This list remains sorted and unchanged. The exact elements of `lft` are not provided, but we know it is sorted.
2. **`ldb`**: This list contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element. For example, if `lft` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]`, then `ldb` would be `[1, 2, 4]`.
3. **`sng`**: This list contains at least one more unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors. Using the same example for `lft`, `sng` would be `[3]` because 3 is not the same as its immediate neighbors 2 and 4.
4. **`rdb`**: This list remains unchanged. The exact elements of `rdb` are not provided.
5. **`sz`**: This variable is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. The exact value of `sz` and `k` are not provided, but we know the relationship between them.

### Focus on `elem`:

The problem statement does not provide a direct definition of `elem`. However, given the context of the lists and the nature of the problem, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb`) that is being processed in a loop.

Since the exact context of the loop or the specific list from which `elem` is derived is not provided, we can infer that `elem` is an element being processed in a loop that iterates over one of these lists.

### Conclusion:

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` without additional context about the loop or the specific list being iterated over. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`:

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, ldb, sng, or rdb that is being processed in a loop)**
