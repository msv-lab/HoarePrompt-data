Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, and `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 1. `i` is 3. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` has `rgt[3]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 4. `i` is 4. If `rgt[4]` is equal to `rgt[3]`, `rdb` has `rgt[4]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
