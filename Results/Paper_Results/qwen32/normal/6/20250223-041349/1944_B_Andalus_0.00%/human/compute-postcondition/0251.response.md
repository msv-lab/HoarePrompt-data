The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, the list `ldb` was initially empty, and now it contains the element `lft[i]`.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is a list containing the element `lft[i]`; `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The list `ldb` now contains the element at index `i` from the list `lft`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
