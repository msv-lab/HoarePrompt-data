The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and the condition `k - sz >= 2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 1 element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 2, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2**.
