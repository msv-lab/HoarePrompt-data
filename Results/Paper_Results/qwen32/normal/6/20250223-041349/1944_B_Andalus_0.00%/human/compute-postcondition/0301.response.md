The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over `sng`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `sng` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the provided state, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them. For the loop to execute, `sng` must have at least one element.

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k`.**
