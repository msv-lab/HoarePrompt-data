To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `lft` is a sorted list that remains unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 1 element.
- `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `sz` is 0.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the variable `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output does not automatically move to a new line after printing.
- However, the variable `elem` is not defined in the given initial state. This indicates that `elem` must be defined somewhere in the code that precedes this snippet, but its definition is not provided in the initial state.

Given that `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `elem` at the point where the `print` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we cannot specify a concrete numerical or string value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem at the point of execution)**
