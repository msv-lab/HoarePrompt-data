To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop logic and the given conditions.

The loop iterates over the elements of `sng` and prints each element until `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lft` is sorted and remains unchanged.
   - `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
   - `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop prints an element from `sng` and increments `sz` by 1.
   - The loop stops if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer:
- After the first iteration, `sz` is `min(2 * len(ldb), k) + 1`.
- After the second iteration, `sz` is `min(2 * len(ldb), k) + 2`.
- After the third iteration, `sz` is `min(2 * len(ldb), k) + 3`.

The loop will continue until `sz` is no longer less than `k`. Therefore, the final value of `sz` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k` that can be expressed as `min(2 * len(ldb), k) + n`, where `n` is the number of iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
- `ldb` remains unchanged.
- `sng` remains unchanged.
- `sz` will be equal to `k` or just greater than `k` if `k` is not an integer increment from `min(2 * len(ldb), k)`.

If `k` is less than or equal to `min(2 * len(ldb), k)`, the loop will not execute at all. Otherwise, the loop will execute until `sz` reaches `k`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will print the first `k` elements of `sng` (or fewer if `sng` has fewer than `k` elements).

**Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `sz` is `k` or the number of elements in `sng` if `k` is greater than the number of elements in `sng`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `lft` and `ldb` remain unchanged, `sng` remains unchanged, and `sz` will be `k` if `k` is less than or equal to the number of elements in `sng`, otherwise `sz` will be the number of elements in `sng`.
