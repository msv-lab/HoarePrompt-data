Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2, and `k - sz` is still greater than or equal to 2, meaning there are at least 2 more iterations or operations to be performed before the loop or if statement is exited. If `k - sz` was initially less than 2, then `sz` remains unchanged.**
