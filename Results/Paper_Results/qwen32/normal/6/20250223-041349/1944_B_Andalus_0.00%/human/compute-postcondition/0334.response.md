The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` is not empty, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` must not be empty. The state of `sz` and `k` affects the internal logic but does not directly influence the loop's ability to execute based on the provided loop statement. The loop will continue to execute as long as `rdb` is not empty.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `rdb` must still not be empty. The states of `sz` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`rdb` must not be empty**
