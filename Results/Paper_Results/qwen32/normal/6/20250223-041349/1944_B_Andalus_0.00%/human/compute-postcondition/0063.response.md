The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, which iterates over the elements of the list `sng`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, the list `sng` must contain at least one element. The states of other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sz`) do not directly affect the execution of this specific for loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least one element that is unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, and `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller.**
