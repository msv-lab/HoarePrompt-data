The code snippet assigns the variable `rgt` to the sublist of `lst` starting from the `n`-th element to the end. This means `rgt` will contain all elements of `lst` that come after the first `n` elements.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`

After the execution of `rgt = lst[n:]`, the variable `rgt` will store the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end of `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`.**
