To determine the output of the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`lst`**: A list of integers provided by the input.
2. **`n`**: The number of elements to consider for the `lft` list.
3. **`k`**: An integer value that influences the loop condition.
4. **`lft`**: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
5. **`ldb`**: Contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them.
6. **`sng`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.
7. **`rgt`**: The remaining elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
8. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
9. **`sz`**: A variable that keeps track of some size or count, influenced by the loop.
10. **`elem`**: A variable that holds a specific element, influenced by the loop.

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
- The value of `elem` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, but it is influenced by the loop and conditions described.
- The loop condition and the `break` statement affect the final value of `elem` and `sz`.
- Since `sz` and `elem` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to infer their possible values based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition and the `break` statement suggest that `elem` is set to a specific value when the loop condition is met.
- Since `sz` and `elem` are not explicitly provided, we can infer that `elem` is set to the first element of `rgt` that has duplicates immediately before it, or to some default value if no such element is found.
- However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of `elem` without knowing the specific input list `lst`, `n`, and `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `elem` and the influence of the loop condition, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of elem as determined by the loop and conditions in the code)**
