The code snippet provided is `sz += 2`. This means the variable `sz` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial conditions:
- `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements.
- `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `sz` is initially increased by 2 (when `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2), otherwise `sz` remains unchanged.
- `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

The only change here is the increment of `sz` by 2. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is increased by 2, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
