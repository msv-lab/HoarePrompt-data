Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is the maximum value it can take, which is `min(k, 2*floor(n/2))`, and all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a list with at least one element; `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` is a list with at least two elements, `sz` is incremented by 2 and must be less than `k`, `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is not less than `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
