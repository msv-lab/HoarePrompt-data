The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over the elements in `sng`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. The states of `lft`, `ldb`, and `sz` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `sng` has at least one element.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k`**
