Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 4. `i` is 4. If `rgt[4]` is equal to `rgt[3]`, `rdb` has `rgt[4]` appended to it.**
