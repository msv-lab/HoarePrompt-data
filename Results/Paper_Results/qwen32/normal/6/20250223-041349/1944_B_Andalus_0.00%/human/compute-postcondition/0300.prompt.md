Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sz` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least one element that has a duplicate immediately before it, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sz` or `elem`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is less than `k`, `sz` and `elem` remain unchanged because the `break` statement was not encountered. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the `break` statement was encountered and `sz` and `elem` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
