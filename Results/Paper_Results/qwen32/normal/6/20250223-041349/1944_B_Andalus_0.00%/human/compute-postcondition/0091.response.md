Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed, `rdb` must have more than one element, and if `sz` is 2, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `sz`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
