To determine what will be printed when the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement executes, we need to understand the context and the variables involved. However, the provided initial state does not specify what `elem` is or where it is defined in the code snippet. Given the current information, we can't directly determine the specific value of `elem`.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the context provided:

1. **`lft`**: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
2. **`ldb`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
3. **`sng`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element.
4. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
5. **`n` and `k`**: Values provided by the input.
6. **`lst`**: A list of integers from the input.
7. **`rgt`**: `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
8. **`sz`**: The smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k`.

Since `elem` is not defined in the provided initial state, we can assume that `elem` is a variable that holds a value from one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, or `rgt`), or it could be a variable used within a loop that iterates over one of these lists.

Given the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we can infer that `elem` is likely to be an element from one of these lists. The `end=' '` argument indicates that the print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space, rather than the default newline.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of what `elem` represents:

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, ldb, sng, rdb, or rgt, depending on the context of the loop or the part of the code where the print statement is executed)**
