The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. To execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

Given the conditions:
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft[i]`.
- Otherwise, if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes `lft[i]` at the end.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1` after it is incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`lft` is a list, and `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n - 1`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes `lft[i]` at the end.**

Since we are only adjusting the state of `i` for the next iteration:
State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same.**
