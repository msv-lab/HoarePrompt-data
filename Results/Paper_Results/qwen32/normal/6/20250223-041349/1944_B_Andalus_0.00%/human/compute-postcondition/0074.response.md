The only variable in the loop head is `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the previously processed element in `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` must be updated to the next element in `sng`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Since `elem` is the next element to be processed, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be updated to the next element in `sng`. Let's denote the next element as `sng[i+1]` where `i` is the current index of `elem` in `sng`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

To be more specific, if `elem` was `sng[i]`, then at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be `sng[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Since we do not have the exact index of the current `elem` in `sng`, we can denote the next element in `sng` as the new `elem`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Given the loop, `elem` should be the next element in `sng`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element.** 

Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element.**

Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`:
