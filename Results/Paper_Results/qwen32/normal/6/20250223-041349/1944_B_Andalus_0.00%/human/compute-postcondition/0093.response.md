To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`sz` is either 0 or 2**: This tells us that `sz` can only take one of these two values.
2. **All elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed**: This indicates that if `sz` is 0, no elements from `sng` have been printed. If `sz` is 2, the first two elements of `sng` have been printed.
3. **`rdb` must have more than one element**: This tells us that `rdb` is a list (or some iterable) with at least two elements.
4. **If `sz` is 2, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2**: This implies that if `sz` is 2, `k` must be at least 4.
5. **If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out of**: This suggests that if `sz` is less than `k`, the loop or if statement continues to execute.
6. **Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of**: This means if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement terminates.

### Code Execution Analysis:
The print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from the list `rdb` or `sng` (since these are the only lists mentioned). Given the structure of the problem, it's reasonable to assume that `elem` is an element from `rdb` because the initial state mentions `rdb` having more than one element, and the code is likely iterating over `rdb`.

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list rdb)**
