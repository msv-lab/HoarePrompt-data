The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `rdb`. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must have at least one element since `elem` will take on the value of each element in `rdb` during each iteration.

Given the initial state where `sz` is 0 and all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed, this information does not directly affect the execution of the for loop over `rdb`. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `rdb` is non-empty.

State: **`sz` is 0, all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed, `rdb` must have at least one element**
