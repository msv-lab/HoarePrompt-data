To determine the output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand what `elem` might represent.

### Initial State Recap:
- `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
- `sng` contains at least one unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors.
- `rdb` remains unchanged.
- `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement suggests that `elem` is being printed. However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. Therefore, we need to infer what `elem` might be based on the context provided.

Given the context, `elem` could be an element from one of the lists `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`, or it could be a variable that is part of a loop or condition within the code that is not provided here. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information, we will assume `elem` is an element from one of these lists or a variable that is being iterated over in a loop.

Since `lft` is mentioned to be sorted and unchanged, and `ldb` and `sng` are derived from `lft`, `elem` could be an element from any of these lists. However, without the exact loop or condition, we can't pinpoint which specific list `elem` is from.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we can only infer that `elem` is an element from one of the lists `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`. The exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without additional context about the loop or condition in which `elem` is being used.

Therefore, the output will be an element from one of these lists, and since we don't have the exact value, we describe it as `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, ldb, or sng)**
