To determine the output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and identify the relevant variables and their values.

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `t` and `T` are integers within the range 1 to 5000.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
   - `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`.
   - `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur based on the given else part.

2. **Key Variables for the Output:**
   - `elem`: This is the variable that will be printed. It is the next element in the list `sng` after the previously processed element.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space.
   - The value of `elem` is not explicitly given, but it is described as the next element in the list `sng` after the previously processed element.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng` after the previously processed element)**
