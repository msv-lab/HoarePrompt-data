Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers. It then prints out `k` integers from the list, prioritizing pairs of identical numbers, and if necessary, single occurrences, from both the first half and the second half of the list separately.**
