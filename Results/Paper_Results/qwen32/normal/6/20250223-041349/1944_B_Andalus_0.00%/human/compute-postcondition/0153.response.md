The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was previously 1 at the start of the first iteration, and assuming this is the second iteration, `i` would have been incremented to 2 at the end of the first iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

No changes are needed for `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `n` as per the loop head. The conditions on these variables are already satisfied based on the problem statement.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 1. `i` is 3**
