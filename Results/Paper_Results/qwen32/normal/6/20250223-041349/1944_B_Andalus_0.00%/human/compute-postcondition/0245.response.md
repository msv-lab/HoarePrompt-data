The code snippet provided is `rdb = []`, which reassigns the variable `rdb` to an empty list. This change only affects the variable `rdb` and does not impact the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]`.**
