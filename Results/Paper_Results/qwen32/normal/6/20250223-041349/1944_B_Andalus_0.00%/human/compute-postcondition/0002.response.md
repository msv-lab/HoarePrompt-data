The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input, which is split into two integers. The initial state of `t` and `T` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
