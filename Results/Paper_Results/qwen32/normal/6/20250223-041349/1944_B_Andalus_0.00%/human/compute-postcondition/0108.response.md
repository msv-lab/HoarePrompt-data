The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The state of `sng` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The condition regarding the break out of the loop remains the same, so if `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, a break would occur in the next evaluation of that condition.

Output State: **`sng` is a list with at least one element; `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
