The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over the elements of the list `ldb`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `ldb` contains at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts, `ldb` is described as containing all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them. To ensure that the loop executes, `ldb` must have at least one element.

Thus, the only state adjustment required is to ensure that `ldb` is not empty. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `sz` is 0**
