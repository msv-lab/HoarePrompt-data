To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is used.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `sng` contains at least one element that is unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`.
- `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

However, the specific value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state. `elem` is likely a variable that is part of a loop or a conditional statement, but without more context, we can infer that `elem` is an element from one of the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, or `sng`.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it in a general sense based on the context.

Given the context, `elem` could be any element from one of the lists mentioned above. Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, rgt, ldb, rdb, or sng)**
