The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `sng`. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` is a list with at least two elements, and `sz` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have more elements than the current index, and `sz` must be less than `k`.

Since `elem` is the current element being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in the list `sng`.

State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements, `sz` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`, `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`**
