Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2, incremented by 1, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If the new `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
