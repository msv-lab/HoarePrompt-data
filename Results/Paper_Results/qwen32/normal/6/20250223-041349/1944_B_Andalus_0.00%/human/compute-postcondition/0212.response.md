To determine exactly what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. `rdb` is a list that must contain at least one element.
2. `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. This implies that `elem` is likely the first element of `rdb` if no other operations have been performed on `rdb` to change its state.
3. The condition `if sz >= k` is mentioned, but it does not affect the `elem` variable or the print statement directly. It only controls the flow of the loop or if statement.
4. The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`. This means `elem` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline will be added at the end of the print statement.

Given these points, we can deduce:
- `elem` is the first element of the list `rdb`.
- Since `elem` is printed twice in the print statement, the output will be the value of `elem` repeated.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of `rdb` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element of the list rdb)**
