The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, and the iterable is `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` must not be empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must still contain at least one element. The state of `sz` and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`rdb` must not be empty**.
