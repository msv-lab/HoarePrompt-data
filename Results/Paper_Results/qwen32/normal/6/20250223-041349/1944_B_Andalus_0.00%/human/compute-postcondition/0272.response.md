The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is assigned the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` contains `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged; `i` is 4**
