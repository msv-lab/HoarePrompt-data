The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `elem` for the loop to execute one more time. The variables `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `k`, and `sz` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` has taken on the value of the last element processed in `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be set to the next element in `ldb`.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors. If `k - sz` is initially greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2 after the potential increase, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after the potential increase, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `elem` is the next element in `ldb`**
