To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`sng`**: A list with at least one element.
2. **`sz`**: Not explicitly mentioned, but it is used in a condition to break out of a loop or if statement.
3. **`k`**: Not explicitly mentioned, but used in a condition with `sz` to break out of a loop or if statement.
4. **`elem`**: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Key Points:
- The variable `elem` is used in the `print` statement, but its value is not provided in the initial state.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` statement means that instead of printing a newline character after the output, it will print a space character.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we know that `elem` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided here. The value of `elem` is not explicitly given, so we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Output Description:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space character. Since the value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the variable itself.

Output: **elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
