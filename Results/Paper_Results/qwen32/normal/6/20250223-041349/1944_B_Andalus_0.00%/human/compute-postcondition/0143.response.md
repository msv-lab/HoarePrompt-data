The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` remains the same. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.**
