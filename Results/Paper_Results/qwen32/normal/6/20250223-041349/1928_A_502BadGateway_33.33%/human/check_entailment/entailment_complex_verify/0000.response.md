### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the logic and verify it with the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. This can be achieved if either `a` or `b` is even, because:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and form an `a x b` rectangle (which is different from `b x a` if `a != b`).

#### Program Code Analysis:
The provided program only checks if `b` is even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```
This logic is insufficient because it does not account for the case where `a` is even. The program will incorrectly return "no" for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, such as `4 x 1` or `6 x 3`.

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.
```
This aligns with the original assessment's critique.

#### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would be:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```
This code checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not account for the case where `a` is even.

**Final: False**
