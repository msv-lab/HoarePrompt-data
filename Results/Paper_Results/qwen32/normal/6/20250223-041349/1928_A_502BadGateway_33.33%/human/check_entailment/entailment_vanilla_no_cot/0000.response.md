Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The function `func_1` only checks if the width `b` is even, which is not the correct condition for forming a different rectangle.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following logic:
- If either dimension `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. This is because cutting a rectangle with an even dimension results in two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, then it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle, because the resulting rectangles would have at least one dimension as 1, and rearranging them would result in the same rectangle (rotated).

Here is the corrected function:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```

This function checks if either `a` or `b` is even and returns 'Yes' if so, otherwise it returns 'No'.
