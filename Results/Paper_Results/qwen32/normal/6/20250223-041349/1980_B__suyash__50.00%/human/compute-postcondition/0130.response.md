Postcondition: **`a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers derived from `a`; `k` is `b[2]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `o` is a list of strings derived from the new input; `n` is the first element of `b`; `f` is the second element of `b`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the condition is met; otherwise, no additional changes are made.**
