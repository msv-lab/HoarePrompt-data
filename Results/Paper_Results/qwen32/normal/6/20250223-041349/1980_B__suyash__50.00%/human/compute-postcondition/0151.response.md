Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `fav` is set to the element at index `i` of the list `l`, so `fav` is `l[0]`.
4. `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`. However, `k` is not defined in the initial state, and `dic` is also not mentioned. Since `k` is not defined, we can assume it has a value that is not relevant to the `print` statement.
5. `k` is greater than or equal to 0, but this condition does not affect the `print` statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `l`, `i`, `fav`, or `k` are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
