Postcondition: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b`; `a` is the string provided by the input; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string by whitespace. If `k` is equal to `n`, then `k` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.**
