Postcondition: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the element at index `i` of the list `l` in the dictionary `dic`, and if `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `a` is the string provided by the input; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string by whitespace, sorted in reverse order, and must have at least one element; `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`; `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order, and must have at least one element. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is adjusted accordingly and if `k` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, `k` is adjusted, and if `k` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `k` remains greater than or equal to 0.**
