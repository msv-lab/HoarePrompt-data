Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for `f`, `k`, and the list `a`. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions are met, it returns a certain result; otherwise, it returns a different result.**
