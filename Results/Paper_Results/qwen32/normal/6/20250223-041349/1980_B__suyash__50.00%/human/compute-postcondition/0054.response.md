The code snippet provided is:
```
k -= dic[l[i]]
```

This line of code subtracts the value of `dic[l[i]]` from `k`. 

Let's break down the changes:
- `k` is reduced by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `o`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Since the specific values of `k`, `dic`, and `l[i]` are not given, we can only express the change in `k` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `a` is the string provided by the input; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string by whitespace, sorted in reverse order, and must have at least one element; `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`; `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order, and must have at least one element; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1; `k` is reduced by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.**
