Postcondition: **`l` is a list with at least one unique element, `i` is 0, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, and `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`. If the resulting value of `k` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is greater than or equal to 0.**
