The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `o`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`, `i`, or `b`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
