The `break` statement in the provided code will terminate the innermost loop or iteration that it is contained within, but it does not affect the values of the variables `l`, `i`, or `k`. The value of `k` is stated to have been decreased by `dic[l[2]]` in the initial state, so this change has already occurred and the `break` does not alter `k` further. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one unique element, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
