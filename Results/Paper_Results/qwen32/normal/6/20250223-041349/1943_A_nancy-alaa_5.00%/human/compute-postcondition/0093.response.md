To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`** is 1.
2. **`n`** is greater than 1.
3. **`first`** is True.
4. **`arr`** is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **`mpp`** is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- The other variables (`n`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp`) are provided but not directly used in the print statement.
- The print statement is straightforward and only prints the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is explicitly defined as 1, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
