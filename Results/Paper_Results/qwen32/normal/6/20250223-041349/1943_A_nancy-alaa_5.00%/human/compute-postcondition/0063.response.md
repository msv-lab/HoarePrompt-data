To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is 2**: This means that the variable `i` has an explicit value of 2.
2. **`first` is True if `mpp[2]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False**: This statement describes the condition for the `first` variable but does not affect the value of `i`.
3. **`n` is greater than 0**: This indicates that `n` has a positive value but does not affect the value of `i`.
4. **`arr` is a list of integers provided by user input**: This describes the content of the `arr` list but does not affect the value of `i`.
5. **`mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`**: This describes the content of the `mpp` Counter object but does not affect the value of `i`.

### Analysis:
The `print(i)` statement only depends on the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
