Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the state remains unchanged.**
