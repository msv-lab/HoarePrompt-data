Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
    - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or deleting them (Bob) until `a` is empty.
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
    - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
    - The code reads multiple test cases.
    - For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `Counter`.
    - It then iterates over the range `0` to `n` and checks if the current number `i` is not in `mpp` (the counter dictionary).
    - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
    - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, it prints `i` and breaks the loop if `first` is `True`.
    - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues:
- The code does not simulate the game where both players play optimally. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the initial counts of elements in `a`.
- The logic for determining the MEX does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
- The code does not handle the strategic moves of Alice and Bob correctly. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, while Bob should aim to minimize it. This involves a more complex strategy than simply checking the counts of elements.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0 0 1 2
```
- According to the optimal strategy:
  - Alice can pick `3` (not present initially) and append it to `c`.
  - Bob can then pick any element (e.g., `0`).
  - Alice can pick `3` again (if not already picked) or another element to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob continues to minimize the MEX.
- The final `c` might be `[3, 0, 1, 2]` or a similar configuration, which would have a MEX of `4`.

However, the provided code will output `3` because it directly checks the counts and does not simulate the game.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX after optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
