Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `i`, `n`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
