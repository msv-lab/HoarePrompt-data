Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `first` is True if `mpp[2]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, the state remains unchanged. If `mpp[2]` is 1 and `first` is True, the state remains unchanged as per the if part. If `mpp[2]` is not 1 or `first` is False, there is no change to the state as per the else part.**
