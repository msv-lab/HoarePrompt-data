Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` is not directly used in the print statement, it provides context).
3. `first` is True (though `first` is not used in the print statement, it provides context).
4. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
6. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1, indicating that the integer `i` (which is 0) appears exactly once in the list `arr`.
7. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then `i` is not present in the keys of `mpp`. Since `mpp[i]` is 1, `i` (0) is indeed a key in `mpp`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the value of the variable `i`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 0.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

### Output:
Output: **0**
