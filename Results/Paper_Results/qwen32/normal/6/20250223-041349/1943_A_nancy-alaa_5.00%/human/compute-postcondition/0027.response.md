To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `i` is `i + 2`: This statement suggests that `i` is being updated to its current value plus 2. However, without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only describe it in terms of its updated value.
- `n` is greater than `i`: This provides a condition that `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only express the printed value in terms of its updated state. The value of `i` is its original value plus 2.

Output: **i (where i is the original value of i plus 2)**
