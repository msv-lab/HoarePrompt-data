Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `c`:**
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
   ```
   The value of `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The code mistakenly uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This will result in an incorrect `c` value.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   The loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   This loop attempts to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the formula used here is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in their friendship values.

3. **Handling of friendship values:**
   The program reads the friendship values but does not use them correctly in the calculation of the expected sum. The friendship values `f_i` should be used to calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.

4. **Modular arithmetic:**
   The program uses modular arithmetic correctly in places, but the overall logic is flawed due to the incorrect calculation of `c` and the incorrect formula for `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. This involves:

- Calculating the probability of selecting each pair of friends.
- Calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
- Summing these expected values to get the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        expected_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + f * expected_increase) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in their friendship values.
