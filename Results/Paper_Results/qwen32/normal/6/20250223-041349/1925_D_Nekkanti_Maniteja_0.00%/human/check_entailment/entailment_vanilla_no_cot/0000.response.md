Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:** The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1`. The denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` because there are `n * (n - 1) // 2` possible pairs of children. The current code incorrectly calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1`, which is equivalent to `n * (n - 1)`.

2. **Incorrect Summation Logic:** The loop `for i in range(k):` is incorrectly calculating the sum `s`. The logic for updating `s` is not correct and does not reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the increasing friendship values.

3. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse:** The modular inverse is used in a way that does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The code should be using the modular inverse to correctly compute the expected value as a fraction and then convert it to the required modulo form.

4. **No Handling of Probability:** The code does not correctly account for the probability of choosing a pair of friends versus a non-friend pair. The expected value needs to consider the probability of choosing each pair and the increasing friendship values.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values, taking into account the probability of choosing each pair and the increasing friendship values. This involves more complex calculations and a different approach to summing the expected values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        m = int(input[idx + 1])
        k = int(input[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        
        friends = {}
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u = int(input[idx])
            v = int(input[idx + 1])
            f = int(input[idx + 2])
            idx += 3
            if u > v:
                u, v = v, u
            friends[(u, v)] = f
        
        # Calculate the expected value
        numerator = 0
        denominator = total_pairs
        
        for (u, v), f in friends.items():
            # Expected value for this pair
            numerator += f * (k + 1) * k // 2
        
        numerator += (total_pairs - m) * k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        # Simplify the fraction
        from math import gcd
        common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
        numerator //= common_divisor
        denominator //= common_divisor
        
        # Calculate the modular inverse of the denominator
        denominator_inv = pow(denominator, -1, M)
        
        # Calculate the result
        result = (numerator * denominator_inv) % M
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values, taking into account the probability of choosing each pair and the increasing friendship values. It also correctly handles the modular arithmetic required for the output.
