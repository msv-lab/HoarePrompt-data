The provided code snippet simply reassigns a new value to the variable `M`. The new value of `M` is `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is `1000000007`. This change does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided in the input over `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `k`**
