The provided code snippet only reassigns the value of `M` to `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value is already given in the initial state as `1000000007`. Therefore, the value of `M` does not change. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `s + c * (m + k - 1) * m * (c^k - 1) / (c - 1) + k * c * a`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m + k`.**
