The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Given the initial state, `dp` is `[1, 5, 9]`. After removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[5, 9]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [5, 9], `i` is 3**.
