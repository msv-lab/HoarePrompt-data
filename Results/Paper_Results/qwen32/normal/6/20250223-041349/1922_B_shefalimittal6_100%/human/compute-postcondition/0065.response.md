Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
