The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `input` is a string containing all the input data.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.
- `idx` is `n + 2`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and all other elements reflect the counts of their respective indices.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.

The expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` will evaluate to 0 because `cnt` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and all other elements reflect the counts of their respective indices, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**
