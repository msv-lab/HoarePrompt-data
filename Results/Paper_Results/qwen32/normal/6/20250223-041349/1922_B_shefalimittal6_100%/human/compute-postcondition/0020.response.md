Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers with `v[x]` equal to 2 and all other elements equal to 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
