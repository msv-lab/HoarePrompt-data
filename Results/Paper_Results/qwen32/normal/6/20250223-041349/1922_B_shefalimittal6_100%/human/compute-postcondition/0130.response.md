To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is the total number of test cases.
2. `n` is the number of elements in the last test case.
3. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the integers for the last test case.
4. `input` is the original input string.
5. `data` is the list of strings from the input.
6. `idx` is the position after the last test case.
7. `results` is a list of strings representing `ans` for each test case.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
- The `results` list contains strings, each representing the answer (`ans`) for a specific test case.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` method concatenates all the strings in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output each string from the `results` list, each on a new line.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **Each string in the `results` list, separated by newline characters** (where each string in the `results` list represents the answer for a specific test case).

So, the final answer is:
Output: **Each string in the `results` list, separated by newline characters (where each string in the `results` list represents the answer for a specific test case)**
