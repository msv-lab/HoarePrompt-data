The provided code snippet increments the variable `ans` by the value of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:
- `ans` is incremented by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `cnt` remains `cnt + v[i]`.
- `v` remains a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `results` remains a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`.
- `idx` remains `12 + n`.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.
- `input` remains a string containing all the input data.
- `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `12 + n`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is incremented by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**
