Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`. `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`. `cnt` is `cnt + v[0]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`. `i` is 3.**
