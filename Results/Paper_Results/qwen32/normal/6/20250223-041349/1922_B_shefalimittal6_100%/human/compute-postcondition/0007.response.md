The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to `n`. Given that `idx` is 1, `n` will be assigned the value of the second element in the `data` list, which is converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
