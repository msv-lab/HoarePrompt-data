The code assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`. The value of `x` is the new input integer, and `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not affected by the current line of code. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the new input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
