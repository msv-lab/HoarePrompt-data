To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables change over time.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified initially. For each iteration:
- An integer `x` is read from the input.
- `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
- `y` is printed.

After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` input integers, and the variable `i` will have reached `t - 1` (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).

Thus, the final state of the loop is:
- `i` will be `t - 1` (since it increments from 0 to `t - 1`).
- `x` will be the last input integer processed by the loop.
- `y` will be the last calculated value, which is `x - 1` for the last `x`.

The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it determines the number of iterations.

**Output State: i is t - 1, x is the last input integer, and y is the last calculated value of x - 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `i` will be one less than the total number of iterations (`t`).
- `x` will be the final integer read from the input.
- `y` will be the final value printed, which is the last `x` minus 1.
