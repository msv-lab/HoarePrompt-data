The value of `y` is assigned the result of `x - 1`. The value of `i` remains incremented by 1, and `x` retains its value as an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `x - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`**.
