The value of `x` is assigned the integer value obtained from `input()`. The value of `i` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, and this state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer**
