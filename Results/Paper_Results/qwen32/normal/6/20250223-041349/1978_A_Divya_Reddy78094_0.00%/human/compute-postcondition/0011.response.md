The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable typically used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `t` is decremented.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of remaining test cases that need to be processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 more than its current value (from the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input.**
