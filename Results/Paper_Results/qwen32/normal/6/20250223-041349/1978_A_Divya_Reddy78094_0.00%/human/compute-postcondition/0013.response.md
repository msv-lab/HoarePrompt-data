The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input. This means that the new value of `nums` will be the list of integers read from the input, and it will overwrite the previous value of `nums`.

The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is the list of integers read from the new input.**
