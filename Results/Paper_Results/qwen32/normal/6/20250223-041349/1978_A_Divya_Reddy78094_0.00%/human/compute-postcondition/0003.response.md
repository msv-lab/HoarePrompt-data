The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` is still an input integer. The new variable `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
