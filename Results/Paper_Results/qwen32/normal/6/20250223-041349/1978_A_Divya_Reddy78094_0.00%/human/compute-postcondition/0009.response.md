The code provided is `nums.sort(reverse=True)`, which sorts the list `nums` in descending order. However, the initial state already specifies that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. Therefore, executing this code does not change the order of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input.**
