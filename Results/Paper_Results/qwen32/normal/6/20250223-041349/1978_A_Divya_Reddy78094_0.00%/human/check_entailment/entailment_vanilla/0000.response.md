### Reasoning:
The problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

The provided program sorts the list of books in descending order of pages and then sums the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages. This approach works because, in order to maximize the total number of pages read, Alice should read the two books with the highest number of pages, regardless of how the other books are divided into the two piles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
2. **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted in descending order. This means the highest number of pages will be at the start of the list.
3. **Summing the Top Two Books**: The program then sums the pages of the first two books in the sorted list, which are the two books with the highest number of pages.
4. **Output**: The sum is printed for each test case.

Since the strategy of picking the two books with the highest number of pages ensures that Alice reads the maximum possible number of pages, and the provided program correctly implements this strategy, the program is correct.
