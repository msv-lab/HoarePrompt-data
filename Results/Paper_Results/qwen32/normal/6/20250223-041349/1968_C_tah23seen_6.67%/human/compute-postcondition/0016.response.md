The code snippet provided modifies the `ans` list by updating the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of its current value and `ans[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `ans[i + 1]` is initially `arr[i] + ans[i]`. After executing the code snippet, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, which is equivalent to `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]`.

All other variables remain unchanged, and the preconditions still hold.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.**
