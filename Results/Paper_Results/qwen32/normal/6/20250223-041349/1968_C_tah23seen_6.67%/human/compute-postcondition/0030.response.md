The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments the value of `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Given that `i` is `0`, this means `ans[1]` will be incremented by `ans[0]`.

Initial State: `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is `0`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` must be less than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

After the execution of `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]`, `ans[1]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is `0`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + ans[0]`**.
