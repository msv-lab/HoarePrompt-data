Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`; `ans[n-1] = ans[n-2] + arr[-1]`.**

This means the list `ans` is constructed based on the given rules, starting with the first element as `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element (up to the second-to-last) is the smallest integer that meets the specified condition relative to the previous elements of `arr` and `ans`. The last element of `ans` is simply the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
