### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly satisfies the problem requirements. We will use the function summary and the provided test cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`.
- It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where:
  - `ans[0]` is one more than the first element of `arr`.
  - Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i <= n-2`) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.
  - The last element `ans[n-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized with zeros.
2. **First Element**: `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
3. **Middle Elements**: For each `i` from `0` to `n-3`:
   - `ans[i+1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i+1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it exceeds `arr[i+1]`.
4. **Last Element**: `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the function `func_1` against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 2 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `3 5 4 9`
   - Computation:
     - `ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5` (since 5 > 2, no adjustment needed)
     - `ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since 9 > 4, no adjustment needed)
     - `ans[3] = 9 + 1 = 10` (but it should be 9 to satisfy `1 = 9 % 4`, so the last element should be adjusted to 9)
     - Output: `3 5 9 9` (incorrect, should be `3 5 4 9`)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `2 5 11`
   - Computation:
     - `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` (since 3 > 1, no adjustment needed)
     - `ans[2] = 3 + 1 = 4` (but it should be 11 to satisfy `1 = 11 % 3`, so the last element should be adjusted to 11)
     - Output: `2 3 4` (incorrect, should be `2 5 11`)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6 4 2 5 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `5 14 16 5 11 24`
   - Computation:
     - `ans[0] = 4 + 1 = 5`
     - `ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9` (but it should be 14 to satisfy `2 = 14 % 4`, so the second element should be adjusted to 14)
     - `ans[2] = 2 + 14 = 16`
     - `ans[3] = 5 + 16 = 21` (but it should be 5 to satisfy `1 = 5 % 16`, so the third element should be adjusted to 5)
     - `ans[4] = 1 + 5 = 6` (but it should be 11 to satisfy `2 = 11 % 5`, so the fourth element should be adjusted to 11)
     - `ans[5] = 11 + 2 = 13` (but it should be 24 to satisfy `2 = 24 % 11`, so the last element should be adjusted to 24)
     - Output: `5 9 16 21 6 13` (incorrect, should be `5 14 16 5 11 24`)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `2 500`
   - Expected Output: `501 500`
   - Computation:
     - `ans[0] = 500 + 1 = 501`
     - `ans[1] = 500 + 501 = 1001` (but it should be 500 to satisfy `500 = 500 % 501`, so the last element should be adjusted to 500)
     - Output: `501 1001` (incorrect, should be `501 500`)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 1 5`
   - Expected Output: `2 7 5`
   - Computation:
     - `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` (but it should be 7 to satisfy `1 = 7 % 2`, so the second element should be adjusted to 7)
     - `ans[2] = 5 + 7 = 12` (but it should be 5 to satisfy `5 = 5 % 7`, so the last element should be adjusted to 5)
     - Output: `2 3 12` (incorrect, should be `2 7 5`)

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly adjust the elements of `ans` to ensure they satisfy the modulo conditions for all test cases. The logic for ensuring `ans[i+1]` is correctly adjusted to satisfy the modulo condition is flawed.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
