The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element `ans[0]` is one more than the first element of `arr`. Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i <= n-2`) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
