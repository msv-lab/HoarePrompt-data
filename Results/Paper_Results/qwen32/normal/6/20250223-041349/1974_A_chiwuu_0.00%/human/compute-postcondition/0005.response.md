The value of `t` is updated to be `b * 2`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `b * 2`, `n` is the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^4), `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer, `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer.**
