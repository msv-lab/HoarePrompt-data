The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` will be strings since `input().split()` returns a list of strings.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` have certain values or expressions. After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the values provided by the input, but they will be in string form. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `t1`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged in terms of the expressions or values given in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as a string; `b` is the second value from input as a string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
