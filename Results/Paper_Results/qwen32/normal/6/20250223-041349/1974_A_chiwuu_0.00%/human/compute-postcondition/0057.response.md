Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function calculates and returns the total number of icons for each test case.**
