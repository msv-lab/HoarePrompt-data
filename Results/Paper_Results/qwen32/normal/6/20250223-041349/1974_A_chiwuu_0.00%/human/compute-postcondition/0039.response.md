Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. **`t` Calculation:**
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = (b * 2) // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t = ((b * 2) // 5) + 1`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4).
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `i` is `x + 1`.

3. **Conditional Updates:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = (b * 2) // 5 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t = t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Calculation of `t`:**
   - The value of `t` is determined by the value of `b`.
   - If `t % 5 == 0` after the initial calculation, `t` remains as `(b * 2) // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1 to make it `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.

2. **Calculation of `t1`:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Conditional Update of `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, `t` is recalculated based on the divisibility of `t2` by 15:
     - `t2` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but we can infer that `t2` is related to the difference `a - t1`.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is adjusted by adding the quotient of `(a - t1) // 15` to the initial `t`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is adjusted by adding the quotient of `(a - t1) // 15` to the initial `t` and then adding 1.

### Conclusion:
The value of `t` printed will depend on the initial value of `b` and the subsequent calculations based on the conditions provided. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `x` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, we can describe the value of `t` based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **t (where t is calculated based on the given conditions involving a, b, and the initial value of t)**
