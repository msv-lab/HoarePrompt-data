Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to include the integer division of `t2` by 15. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
