In the provided task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The state before the loop starts includes `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, there are integers `x` and `y` representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. The variable `n` is explicitly assigned the value of `t`.

Since `n` is assigned the value of `t` before the loop starts, the only variable we can adjust within the loop head to ensure the loop executes is `i`. However, the value of `i` is initialized automatically by the `range(n)` function and does not need to be adjusted manually before the loop starts. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment in terms of the loop head variables `i` and `n` for the loop to execute. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99)**
