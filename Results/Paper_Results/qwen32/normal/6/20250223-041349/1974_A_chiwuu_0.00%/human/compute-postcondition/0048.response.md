The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `t1` using the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The only variable that is affected is `t1`.

Given:
- `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.
- `n` is the number of test cases.
- `a` is the first value from input.
- `b` is the second value from input.
- `t1` is initially `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `i` is `x + 2`.

After the execution of the code snippet, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
