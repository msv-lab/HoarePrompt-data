The given code snippet is `t = t`, which means the value of `t` is being assigned to itself. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
