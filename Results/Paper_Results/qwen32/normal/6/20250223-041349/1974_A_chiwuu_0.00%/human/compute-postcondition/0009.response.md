The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`. Given the initial state that `t` is `b * 2` and `t` is not divisible by 5, the new value of `t` will be the integer division of `b * 2` by 5, plus 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4), `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer, `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer**.
