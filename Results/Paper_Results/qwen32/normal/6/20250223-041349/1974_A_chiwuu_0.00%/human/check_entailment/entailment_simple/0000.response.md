### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t = b * 4`.
   - It then determines how many 5x3 screens are needed to accommodate these 2x2 icons:
     - `t = t // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5.
     - `t = t // 5 + 1` otherwise.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The total number of cells on `t` screens is `t * 15`.
   - The number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
   - The remaining cells available for 1x1 icons is `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Sufficient:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates how many more screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1`
     - `t = t + t2 // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15.
     - `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens `t` required for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

- **Test Case 1: `x = 1, y = 1`**
  - 1x1 icons: 1
  - 2x2 icons: 1
  - 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, requiring 1 screen.
  - Remaining cells: 15 - 4 = 11.
  - 11 cells are enough to place 1 1x1 icon.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: `x = 7, y = 2`**
  - 1x1 icons: 7
  - 2x2 icons: 2
  - 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, requiring 2 screens.
  - Remaining cells: 30 - 8 = 22.
  - 22 cells are enough to place 7 1x1 icons.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: `x = 12, y = 4`**
  - 1x1 icons: 12
  - 2x2 icons: 4
  - 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, requiring 4 screens.
  - Remaining cells: 60 - 16 = 44.
  - 44 cells are enough to place 12 1x1 icons.
  - Output: `4` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

The calculation for Test Case 3 seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the logic:

- **Re-evaluation for Test Case 3:**
  - 2x2 icons: 4, requiring 2 screens (10 cells used, 20 remaining).
  - Place 2x2 icons optimally to leave maximum space for 1x1 icons.
  - Remaining cells on 2 screens: 30 - 16 = 14.
  - Place 12 1x1 icons on 2 screens (14 cells are sufficient).

The program does not account for optimal placement of 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases optimally, particularly when 2x2 icons do not perfectly fill the screens. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
