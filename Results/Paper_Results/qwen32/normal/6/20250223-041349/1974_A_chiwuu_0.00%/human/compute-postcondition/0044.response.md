The code snippet `t = b * 2` updates the value of `t` to be `b * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the new value of `t` is `b * 2`, the conditions for determining `t` in the initial state are no longer directly applicable because `t` has been reassigned.

Output State: **`t` is `b * 2`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
