The code snippet converts the variable `b` from a string to an integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `a` remains a specific integer value as it is not modified either. The variable `b` is now an integer instead of a string.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer, `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer.**
