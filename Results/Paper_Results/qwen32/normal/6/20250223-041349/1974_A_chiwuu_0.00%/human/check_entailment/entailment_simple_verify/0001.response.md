Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives a total of 15 cells.
- **Icon Types**:
  - 1x1 icons (x applications)
  - 2x2 icons (y applications), each occupying 4 cells.
- **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens**:
   - **Step 1**: Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`).
     - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Thus, `b` 2x2 icons occupy `b * 4` cells.
     - Each screen has 15 cells. The number of screens needed for `b * 4` cells is calculated as:
       - If `b * 4` is perfectly divisible by 15, `t = (b * 4) // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = (b * 4) // 15 + 1`.
   - **Step 2**: Calculate the remaining cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons (`t1`).
     - Total cells used for 2x2 icons: `b * 4`.
     - Total cells available on `t` screens: `t * 15`.
     - Remaining cells: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - **Step 3**: Check if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells.
     - If `t1 >= a`, all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells, and no additional screens are needed.
     - If `t1 < a`, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`):
       - Remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
       - Additional screens needed: If `t2` is perfectly divisible by 15, `t += t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t += t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Reviewing the Program:
Let's review the logic and the annotated version:

1. **Step 1**:
   - `t = b * 2` is incorrect. It should be `t = b * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The correct calculation is:
     ```python
     t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # This is equivalent to (b * 4) // 15 + 1 if there is a remainder
     ```

2. **Step 2**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct. This calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Step 3**:
   - `if t1 >= a` is correct. If the remaining cells can fit all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = a - t1` is correct. This calculates the remaining 1x1 icons that need additional screens.
   - The additional screens needed are calculated correctly:
     ```python
     t += (t2 + 14) // 15  # This is equivalent to (t2) // 15 + 1 if there is a remainder
     ```

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Correct calculation for screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            t += (t2 + 14) // 15  # Correct calculation for additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(t)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Testing the Corrected Program:
Let's test the corrected program with the given examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - `b * 4 = 4`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - `b * 4 = 8`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - `b * 4 = 16`, `t = 2`.
   - `t1 = 30 - 16 = 14`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 12 - 14 = 2`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 2`, `t += 2 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
   - `b * 4 = 12`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 12 = 3`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 3 - 3 = 0`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 0`, `t += 0 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 1`, `t += 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
   - `b * 4 = 4`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

7. **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `0`.

8. **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 2`, `t += 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

9. **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 15`, `t += 15 // 15 + 0 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

10. **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
    - `b * 4 = 8`, `t = 1`.
    - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`.
    - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`.
    - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 1`, `t += 1 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
    - Output: `2`.

11. **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
    - `b * 4 = 36`, `t = 3`.
    - `t1 = 45 - 36 = 9`.
    - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 0 - 9 = 9`.
    - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 9`, `t += 9 // 15 + 1 = 5`.
    - Output: `5`.

### Conclusion:
The original program had an incorrect calculation for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`t = b * 2` instead of `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`). The corrected program handles all test cases correctly.

Final: **False** (
