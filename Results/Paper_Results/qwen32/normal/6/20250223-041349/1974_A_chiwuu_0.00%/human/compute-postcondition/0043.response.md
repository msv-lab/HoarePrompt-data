The code snippet converts the variable `b` from a string to an integer. This change affects the value of `b`, but it does not directly affect the other variables unless they are recalculated or depend on `b` in subsequent code. Given the initial state, the value of `t` is determined based on the original value of `b` (as a string), and `t1` is calculated using the original value of `b` as a string. Since `b` is now an integer, `t1` and `t` would need to be recalculated if they were to be used again, but the provided code snippet does not do so. The value of `i` is also independent of `b` in the given snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
