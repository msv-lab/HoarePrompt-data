The code converts the variable `a` from a string to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer, `b` is the second integer from the current input line as a string.**
