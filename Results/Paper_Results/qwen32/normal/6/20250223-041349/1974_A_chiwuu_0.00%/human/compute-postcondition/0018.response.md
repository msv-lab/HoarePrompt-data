The code snippet modifies the value of `t` by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Here's the step-by-step impact:
1. `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and is checked for divisibility by 15.
2. `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.

Given the initial state, `t` is either `(b * 2) // 5` or `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`, and `t1` is calculated accordingly as `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` or `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. The value of `t2` is `a - t1` and is used to update `t`.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer; `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer; `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1` and `t2 % 15 == 0`.**
