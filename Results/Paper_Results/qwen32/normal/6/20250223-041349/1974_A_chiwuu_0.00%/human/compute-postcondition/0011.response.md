Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine the output state after the code execution.

Initial State:
- `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.
- `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4).
- `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer.
- `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer.

The code snippet:
```
t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `t1` is calculated based on the current values of `t` and `b`.

Given that `t` is either `(b * 2) // 5` or `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, we can express `t1` in terms of `b`:
1. If `t = (b * 2) // 5`, then `t1 = ((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4`.
2. If `t = (b * 2) // 5 + 1`, then `t1 = (((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`.

Other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer; `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer; `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`.**
