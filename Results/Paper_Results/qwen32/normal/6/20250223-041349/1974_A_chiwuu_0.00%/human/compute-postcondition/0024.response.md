The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Given:
- `t` is calculated based on the value of `b`.
- `n` is the number of test cases.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the current input line.
- `t1` is calculated based on the value of `t` and `b`.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `t1`, `a`, `b`, `t2`) are in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration. The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is some value `x` (where `0 ≤ x < n`).
For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4). `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer. `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer. `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1`. `i` is `x + 1`**
