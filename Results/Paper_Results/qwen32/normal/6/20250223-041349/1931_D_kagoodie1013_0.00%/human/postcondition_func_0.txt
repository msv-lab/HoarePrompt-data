The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` that can be formed from the list `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder of an element when divided by `x` and `mod_y` is the remainder when divided by `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.
