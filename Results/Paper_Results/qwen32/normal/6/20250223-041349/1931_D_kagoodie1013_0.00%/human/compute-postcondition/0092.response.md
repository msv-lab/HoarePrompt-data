Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final value of `count` for each processed tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` represents the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered for that specific tuple.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list named `results`. This list contains counts for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each count is the number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` found during the processing of the tuple.
