The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is used to iterate over the elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if and only if `arr` contains at least one element.
2. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.
3. The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` is the list over which the loop iterates.

Given this, to ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The other variables can remain as they are.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element in `arr`**.
