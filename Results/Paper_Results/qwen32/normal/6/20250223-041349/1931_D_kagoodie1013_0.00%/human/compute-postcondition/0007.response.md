The code snippet provided calculates the value of `mod_y` by taking the modulus of `num` with `y`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` is meant to be the first element of `arr` from the first tuple in `test_cases`, we can proceed with the calculation.

Given:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0.
- `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `mod_x` is `-test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`.

Let's assume `num` is `test_cases[0][3][0]` for the calculation of `mod_y`.

Thus, `mod_y` will be calculated as `test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][2]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_x` is `-test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`; `mod_y` is `test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][2]`.**
