Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, x, y, and arr; `results` is a list containing the final value of count for the processed tuple; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_x_key and values as their respective counts for the processed tuple; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_y_key and values as their respective counts for the processed tuple; The current tuple (n, x, y, arr) is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed.**

Explanation: The variable `count` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
