The code snippet provided resets the `mod_y_map` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This means that any previous key-value pairs in `mod_y_map` are removed.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In natural language: The `mod_y_map` dictionary has been reset to be empty, while all other variables retain their previous values and states.
