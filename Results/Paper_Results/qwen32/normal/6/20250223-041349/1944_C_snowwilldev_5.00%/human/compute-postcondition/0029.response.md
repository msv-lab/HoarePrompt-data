Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` can be either 0 or 3. However, its value is dependent on the condition involving `cnt[i]`.
- `N` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where `cnt[x]` represents the number of times integer `x` appears in list `a`.
- The current value of `i` is `N-1`.

### Key Point:
- The value of `t` is updated based on the condition `if cnt[i] == 1`, but this does not affect the value of `i`.
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as `N-1`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(i)` statement will print the current value of `i`.
- Since `i` is explicitly set to `N-1`, the print statement will output `N-1`.

### Final Output:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `N-1`.

Output: **N-1**
