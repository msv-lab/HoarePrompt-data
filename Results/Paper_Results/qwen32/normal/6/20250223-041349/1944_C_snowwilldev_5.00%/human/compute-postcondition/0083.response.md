Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is equal to `N-1`
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1
- `N` is greater than 0
- Either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is defined as `N-1`. This means `i` holds the value that is one less than `N`.
- The statement `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the value of `i` itself.
- The conditions `N > 0`, `t >= 2`, and `cnt[i] == 0` are given, but they do not directly influence the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `N-1`.

### Output:
Output: **N-1 (where N is a value greater than 0)**
