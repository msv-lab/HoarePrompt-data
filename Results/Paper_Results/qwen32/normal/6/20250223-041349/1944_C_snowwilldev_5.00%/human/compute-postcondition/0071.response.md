The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state that `N` must be greater than 0, this precondition remains valid. The only change is in the value of `cnt[a[i]]`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0; `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
