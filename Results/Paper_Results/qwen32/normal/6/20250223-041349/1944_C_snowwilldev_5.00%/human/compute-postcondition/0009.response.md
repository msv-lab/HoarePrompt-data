The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Given that `i` is 2, the count of `a[2]` is incremented by 1.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys except `a[0]` which is 1 and `a[1]` which is 2, `i` is 2.

After executing `cnt[a[i]] += 1`, the count of `a[2]` in `cnt` is increased by 1. If `a[2]` was not already a key in `cnt`, it is now added with a value of 1. If `a[2]` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys except `a[0]` which is 1, `a[1]` which is 2, and `a[2]` which is 3, `i` is 2.**
