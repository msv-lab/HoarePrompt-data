The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` of the list `a` in the defaultdict `cnt`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the count of `a[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys except `a[0]` which is 1, `i` is 0**.
