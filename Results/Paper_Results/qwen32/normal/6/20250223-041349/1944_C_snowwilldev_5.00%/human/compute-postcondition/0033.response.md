The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than the integer value of the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, and `i` is `N-1`, we need to adjust the state of `tc` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` would have taken on a value from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `int(input())`.

Since the state of `t` and `i` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted, we only adjust `tc`.

State: **`t` is the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`**
