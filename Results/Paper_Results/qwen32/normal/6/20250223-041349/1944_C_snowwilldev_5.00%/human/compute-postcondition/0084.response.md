The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or control structure (such as a for or while loop) that it is contained within. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `i`, `cnt[a[i]]`, `N`, `t`, and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State except for the fact that the loop is exited.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is greater than 0, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
