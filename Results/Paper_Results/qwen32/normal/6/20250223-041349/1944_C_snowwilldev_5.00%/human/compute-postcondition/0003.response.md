The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default integer value of 0 for all keys. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys.**
