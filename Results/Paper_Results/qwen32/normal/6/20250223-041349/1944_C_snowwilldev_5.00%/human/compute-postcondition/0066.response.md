The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than the integer value of the input. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` has reached a value that is one less than the integer value of the input because the loop increments `tc` by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **The loop will terminate when either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0. The final value of `i` will be printed, and `t` will be at least 2 if the loop breaks due to `t >= 2`. `tc` will be `tc + 1`, and `N`, `a`, and `cnt` will remain unchanged.**
