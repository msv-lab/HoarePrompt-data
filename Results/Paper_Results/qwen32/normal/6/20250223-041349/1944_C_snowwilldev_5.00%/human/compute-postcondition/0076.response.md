Output State: **`i` is equal to `N-1`, and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `N-1` (which is the last index of the list `a` if `N` is the length of `a`). Additionally, the count for the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` will have been incremented by 1. The loop terminates because `i` has reached the last valid index for the list `a`.
