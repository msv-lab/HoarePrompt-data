To determine the state before the for loop that ensures the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for tc in range(int(input())):`. The variable `tc` is the loop variable, and `int(input())` determines the number of iterations.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` is the loop variable and will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

### Required Adjustments:
- The variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The list `a` and its properties (length `n` and the integers `a_i`) are not relevant to the execution of the outer loop; they will be relevant within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer.
