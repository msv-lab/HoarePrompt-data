The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `defaultdict` `cnt` by 1. This means that the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` is increased by 1. 

Given the initial state, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented by 1, and no other variables are directly affected by this operation. The variable `t` (the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once) may change if the count of `a[i]` transitions from 1 to 2, but without additional information, we cannot determine its exact value. The variables `i`, `tc`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the updated count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of `a[i]` incremented by 1.**
