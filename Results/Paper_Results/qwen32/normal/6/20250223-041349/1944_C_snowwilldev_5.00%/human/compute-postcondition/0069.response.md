The given code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with `int` as the default factory. This means that any key that does not exist in `cnt` will automatically be initialized to `0` when accessed.

Given the initial state, the only change is the creation of the `cnt` dictionary. The values of `N`, `t`, `cnt[i]`, `i`, `tc`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` will terminate when either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0, the final value of `i` will be printed, and `t` will be at least 2 if the loop breaks due to `t >= 2`. `tc` will be `tc + 1`. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
