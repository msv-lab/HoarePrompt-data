The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `N` must be greater than `i`, which implies that `i` is a valid index for the list `a`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than `i`; `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.** 

This means that the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt` has been increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
