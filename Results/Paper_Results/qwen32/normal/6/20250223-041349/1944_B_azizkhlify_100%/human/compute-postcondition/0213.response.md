Postcondition: **The loop prints all elements in `res` sequentially. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop has executed `n` times or fewer, and for each iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0, and `ur` has increased by 2. The values of `ul` and `ur` determine if the loop broke. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop did not execute or broke due to this condition.**
