The given initial state only specifies that `res` must contain at least one element. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(i, end=' ')`. This statement prints the value of the variable `i` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.

The value of `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variable `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
