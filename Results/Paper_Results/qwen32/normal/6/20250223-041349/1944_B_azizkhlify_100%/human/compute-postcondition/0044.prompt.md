Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `2*n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `ul` is either `k * 2` or remains unchanged; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, except if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0; `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `l[a[1] - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, except if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0; `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, or `k * 2 + 4` or `k * 2 + 6` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 2. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `l[a[1] - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
