To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the specific variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
- `ul` is either `k * 2` or remains unchanged.
- `ur` remains unchanged.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Determining the Values:
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the exact value of `a[1]` (i.e., the second element of `a`) is not provided in the initial state. However, based on the information provided, we know that `a[1]` is an integer from the input list.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the value of `a[1]` twice, separated by a space, and no newline character at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
