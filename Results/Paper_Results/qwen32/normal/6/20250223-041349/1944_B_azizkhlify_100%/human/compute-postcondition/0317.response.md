The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the innermost loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `n`, `r`, `a`, `i`, and `ur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 2`. If the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
