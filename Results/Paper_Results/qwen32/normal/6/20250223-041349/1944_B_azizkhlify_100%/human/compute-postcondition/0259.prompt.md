Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is an empty list; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` retains its previous value; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then `ul` remains equal to `k * 2`. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, `ul` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if it was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ul` is `ul + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, and all other elements of `l` remain unchanged. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
