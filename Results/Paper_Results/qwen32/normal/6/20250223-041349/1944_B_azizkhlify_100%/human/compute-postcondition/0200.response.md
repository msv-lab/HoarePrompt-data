The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to 0. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The specific value of `a[i] - 1` determines which element in `r` is set to 0, but without specific values for `a` and `i`, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
