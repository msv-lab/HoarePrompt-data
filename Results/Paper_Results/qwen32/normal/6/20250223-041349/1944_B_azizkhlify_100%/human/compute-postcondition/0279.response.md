To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are manipulated.

The initial state and the description of the changes to the variables provide us with the following information:
- `a` remains the same, indicating that `a` is a list or array that is not modified in the described operations.
- `res` is updated conditionally based on the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`, but it is not directly related to the `print` statement.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, indicating a loop condition.
- `k` is updated based on a formula but is not directly related to the `print` statement.
- `l` has elements set to 0 under certain conditions, but the specific element `l[a[i] - 1]` is key to determining what is printed.
- `r` remains the same.
- `re` is incremented if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
- `ul` is a count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2.
- `ur` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space. The value of `i` is incremented at the end of the loop, but for this specific `print` statement, we need to focus on the current value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the operations described, the value of `a[i]` will be the element at the current index `i` of the list `a`. Since `a` remains the same throughout the operations, the value of `a[i]` is simply the element at the index `i` of the original list `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
