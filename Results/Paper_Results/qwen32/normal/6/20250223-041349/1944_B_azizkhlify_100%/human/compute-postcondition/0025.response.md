Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, with `l[a[i] - 1]` now equal to 0; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is 2; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been incremented by 2, making it equal to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
