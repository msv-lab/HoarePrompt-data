Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if it was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ul` is `ul + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, and all other elements of `l` remain unchanged. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
