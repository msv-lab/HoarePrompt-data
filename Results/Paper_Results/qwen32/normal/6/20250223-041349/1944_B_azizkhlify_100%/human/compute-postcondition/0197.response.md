Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition is met and we break out of the loop or if statement, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if it was 2 before, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a` is a list of integers. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
