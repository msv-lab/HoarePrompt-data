The code snippet `re += 1` increments the value of the variable `re` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `re` was either equal to `k` or not. After the increment, `re` will be `re + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `re` equals `k + 1` or `re + 1` if `re` was not equal to `k`, `res` includes all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 up to the point where `re` equals `k` or remains unchanged.**
