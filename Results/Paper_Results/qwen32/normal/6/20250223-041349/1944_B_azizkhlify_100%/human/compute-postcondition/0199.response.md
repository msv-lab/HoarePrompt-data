To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`. However, there is no initial value given for `i` in the precondition. This statement seems to imply that `i` is being incremented by 1, but we don't know its starting value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet tries to print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
- However, there is no information provided about the list `a` or the initial value of `i`.
- Given that `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), we can assume that `i` was some value before this increment, but we don't know what that value was. Therefore, we can't determine the exact value of `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
Since we don't have the initial value of `i` or the contents of the list `a`, we can't determine the exact values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables and list provided.

Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i is the incremented index and a is the list containing the elements being accessed)**
