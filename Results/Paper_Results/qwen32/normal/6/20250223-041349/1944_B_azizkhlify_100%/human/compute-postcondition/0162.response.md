Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` contains `a[0]`, `re` is equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variables `n`, `i`, `res`, and `re` retain their initial values. The only change is that the code execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
