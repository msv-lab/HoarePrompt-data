Postcondition: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero, `a` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` is incremented by 2 for each index `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 (but not exceeding `k * 2`), `ur` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is `2*n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations.**
