To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` contains `a[0]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is given as 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that it has at least two elements because `n` is greater than 1 and `res` contains `a[0]`.
3. **Indexing**: The code snippet prints `a[i]`, which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1.

### Output:
Given that `a` is a list with at least two elements and `i` is 1, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value that will be printed. However, based on the information given, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
