Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**
