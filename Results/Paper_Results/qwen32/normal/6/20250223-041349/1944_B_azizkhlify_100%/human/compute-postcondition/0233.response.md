The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is an empty list; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` retains its previous value; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `i` is `n + 2`**
