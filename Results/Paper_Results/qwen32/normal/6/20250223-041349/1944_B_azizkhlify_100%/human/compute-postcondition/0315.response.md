The code snippet provided increments the value of `ur` by 2. The values of `n`, `r`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is 0, and the values at all other indices are either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is increased by 2**.
