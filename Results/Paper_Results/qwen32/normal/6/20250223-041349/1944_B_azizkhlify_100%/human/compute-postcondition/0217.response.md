The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial state does not specify any pre-existing values for `a`, so we assume `a` is being defined here. The other variables (`res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `r`) are mentioned but not altered by this specific code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `r` retain their previous values.**
This means that `a` now holds the list of integers from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
