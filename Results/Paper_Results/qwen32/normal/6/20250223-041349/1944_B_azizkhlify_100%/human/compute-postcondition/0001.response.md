The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
