Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `ul` and `ur` are variables that are compared within a loop or condition, but their values are not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is set to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is trying to access `a[i]` twice, where `i` is set to `n + 1`.
- Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` will be at least 1 (if `n` is 0) or greater.
- However, the length of the list `a` is not specified, but we know that `i` is `n + 1`, which means it is out of bounds if `a` has `n` or fewer elements.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is set to `n + 1`, and assuming `a` has `n` or fewer elements, accessing `a[i]` will result in an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not execute the print statement successfully and will raise an error instead.

However, based on the given precondition and without any additional context about the length of `a`, we can only describe the intended output if `a` had enough elements.

### Output Description:
If `a` had at least `n + 2` elements, the print statement would output the value at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) twice, followed by a space.

Given the current precondition, the exact values cannot be determined, but the structure of the output can be described.

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a[n + 1] is the value at index n + 1 of the list a, assuming a has at least n + 2 elements)**

However, since the precondition does not guarantee that `a` has enough elements, the actual execution would likely result in an `IndexError`.
