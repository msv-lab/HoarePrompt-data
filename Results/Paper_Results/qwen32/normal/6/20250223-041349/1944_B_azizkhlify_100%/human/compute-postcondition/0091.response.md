To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list (although its contents are not explicitly provided, we know it is a list).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Index Calculation**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`. This means that `i` is one more than the value of `n`.
   - Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` will be a positive integer (starting from 1 when `n` is 0).

2. **Accessing List Elements**:
   - The code attempts to access `a[i]` twice.
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the contents of the list `a`.
   - Since the exact contents of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `a[i]` is an element at index `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Printing Behavior**:
   - The `print` function will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end due to the `end=' '` argument.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The code will print the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) of the list `a` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i is n + 1 and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
