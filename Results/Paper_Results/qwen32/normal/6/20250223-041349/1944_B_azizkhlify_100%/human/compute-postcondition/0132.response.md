The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `l` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given the initial state where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, this element is now changed to 0. The other conditions and values of `n` and the other elements of `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**
