The code sets the element at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` to `0`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid, but now `i` has a new value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0`**.
