Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u`, where `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; `v` is in `remaining_vertices`; `v` is not 0.**

Explanation: The `path` list now contains the vertex `v` twice because `v` was already in the list and the code appends `v` to it again. All other variables remain unchanged.
