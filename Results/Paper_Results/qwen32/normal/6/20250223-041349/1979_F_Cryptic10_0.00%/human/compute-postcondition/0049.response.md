The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `d`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `d` was decremented by 1.

Given that the loop iterates with `d` starting from `n - 1` and decrementing by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be the previous value of `d` minus 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. 

To execute the next iteration, `d` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`.**
