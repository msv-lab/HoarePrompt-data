The only object in the loop head is the variable `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decremented by 1 again from its current value.

Given that the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, if `d` is currently `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `k - 1`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `d`, we can infer that `d` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration and is now `k - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `k - 2`.

However, without the specific value of `d` from the previous iteration, we can generalize that `d` should be one less than its current value, which is `d - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` three times (with the additional `v` added at the end), and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` once or twice, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described. `d` is `d - 1`**
