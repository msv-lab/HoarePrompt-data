Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Problem Overview:
- We are given a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, from which exactly `(n - 2)` edges have been removed.
- We need to find a Hamiltonian path in this graph in at most `n` queries.
- The queries involve asking for a vertex `v` with a degree of at least `d` and another vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
- The vertex `v` is then removed from the graph.
- The program must output the Hamiltonian path in the correct order after all queries.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function makes a query with the degree `d`.
   - It prints the query and flushes the output to ensure the query is sent.
   - It waits for the response, which consists of two integers: `v` and `u`.
   - It returns these two integers.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function is responsible for finding the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are processed.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, so it continues to the next degree.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, then breaks out of the inner loop to query the next vertex.
   - After processing all vertices, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the correct order.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the strategy of querying vertices with decreasing degrees and ensuring that each vertex is added to the path only once.
- The use of a set `remaining_vertices` ensures that each vertex is only processed once, which aligns with the requirement to make no more than `n` queries.
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the query and response mechanism as described in the problem statement.
- The final output of the path is in the correct format and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the strategy to find the Hamiltonian path within the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
