The only object in the loop head is the variable `d`. According to the loop statement, `d` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is 1 (assuming the previous state was when `d` was 2, as we need to decrement `d` by 1 for the next iteration).

Given this, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is `[0, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`, otherwise `path` is `[v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

For the next iteration, `d` should be:
