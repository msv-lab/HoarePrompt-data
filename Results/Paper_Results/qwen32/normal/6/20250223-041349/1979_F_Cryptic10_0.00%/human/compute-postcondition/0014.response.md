The code snippet assigns the return values of `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. Given that `d` is 1 and `u` was previously assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`, the new assignment will update `v` to the first return value of `func_1(1)` and `u` to the second return value of `func_1(1)`. The initial state of `v` is 0, and `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` when `d` was 1. Since `v` and `u` are reassigned, their new values will be the outputs of `func_1(1)`. The other variables `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1.**
