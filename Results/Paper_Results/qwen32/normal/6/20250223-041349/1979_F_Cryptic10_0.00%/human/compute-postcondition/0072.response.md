Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**
