Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and one vertex `u` (where `u` is not equal to `v` and `1 <= u <= n`) is added back to `remaining_vertices`
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; if `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` twice, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains unchanged beyond the given postcondition of the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added as the last element of `path`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is also removed from `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`. If `v` is 0, the program continues with the unchanged state described above. Otherwise, the program continues with the unchanged state described above and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
