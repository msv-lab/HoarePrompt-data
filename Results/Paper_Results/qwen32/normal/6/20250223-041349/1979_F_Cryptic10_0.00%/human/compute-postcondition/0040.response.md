Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; if `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` twice, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
