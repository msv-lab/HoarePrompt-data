Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and now includes `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`, and now `v` is also removed from `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`. If `v` is 0, the program continues with the unchanged state described above. Otherwise, the program continues with the unchanged state described above and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, `v`, and `d` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
