The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` updates the values of `v` and `u` by calling the function `func_1` with the argument `d`. After the function call, `v` and `u` will hold the values returned by `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`.
- `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed.
- If `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `v`.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` twice, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `d` is `d - 1`.

After the execution of `v, u = func_1(d)`, `v` and `u` will be updated to the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The value of `d` is not changed in this snippet, so `d` remains `d - 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`.**
