Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is `[0, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`, otherwise `path` is `[v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`; `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The values of `v` and `u` are updated to the return values of `func_1(d)`, where `d` is 0. The other variables (`n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged unless `v` is 0, in which case all variables remain as they were initially.
