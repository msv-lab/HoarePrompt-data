The code snippet sorts the sublist `temp`, which is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `temp` sublist, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
