The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp` in ascending order. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only variable that is affected is `temp`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `max` retains its original value, `i` retains its original value.**
