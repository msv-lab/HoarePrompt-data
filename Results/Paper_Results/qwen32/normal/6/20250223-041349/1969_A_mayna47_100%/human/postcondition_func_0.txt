The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from the input. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such index is found after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).
