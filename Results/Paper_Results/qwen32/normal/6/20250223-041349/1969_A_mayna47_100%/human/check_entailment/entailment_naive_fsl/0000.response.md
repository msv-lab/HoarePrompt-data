Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program assumes that if there is a mutual friendship (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then the answer is always 2. However, this is not always the case.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, the friendships form a cycle: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 1. There are no mutual friendships (i.e., no `v[v[i]] == i`), but it is still possible to invite only 2 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. For example, inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party because they each have their best friends (2 and 1, respectively) invited.

The program incorrectly prints 3 for this case, which is not the minimum number of invitations needed.

Here is another example:
```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```
In this case, the friendships form a cycle: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 1. Again, there are no mutual friendships, but inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. The program incorrectly prints 3 for this case as well.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and is incorrect.
