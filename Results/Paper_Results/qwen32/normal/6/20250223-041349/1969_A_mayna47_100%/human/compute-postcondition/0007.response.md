Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers provided in the input, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
