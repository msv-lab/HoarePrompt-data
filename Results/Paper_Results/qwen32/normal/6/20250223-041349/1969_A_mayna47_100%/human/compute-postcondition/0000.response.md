The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition states that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 50`. After executing this code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 50`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer where 2 <= `n` <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.**
