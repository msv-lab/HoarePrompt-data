Output State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `k` is the value read from the input, `res` is `n - 2`, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `n` must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and the current value of `dif` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so it changes from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
