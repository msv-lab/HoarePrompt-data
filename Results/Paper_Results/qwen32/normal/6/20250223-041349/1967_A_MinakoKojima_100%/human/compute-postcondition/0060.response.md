Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` was originally greater than 0, the behavior depends on the value of `k` relative to `dif * (i + 1)`: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` was originally 0, the loop or if statement is broken without changing `ans`, `k`, or `res`.**
