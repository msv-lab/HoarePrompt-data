The code snippet calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` of the array `a`, and assigns this difference to the variable `dif`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this code snippet is executed. Therefore, `dif` will be the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` of the array `a`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
