Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `a[0]`, `k` is the value read from the input, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `a[0]` if `k < dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + dif`. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element. `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1` and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, the behavior depends on the value of `k`: if `k` was originally 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `ans`, `k`, or `res`. If `k` was not 0, and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif`, `k` is decremented by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decremented by 1. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` is decremented by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`. If `dif` is not 0, `ans` remains unchanged and `k` is 0. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
