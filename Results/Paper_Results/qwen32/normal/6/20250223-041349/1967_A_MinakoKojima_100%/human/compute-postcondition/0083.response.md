Output State: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `k` is the value read from the input and is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1` since `dif` is not 0, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to `a[0] + dif`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
