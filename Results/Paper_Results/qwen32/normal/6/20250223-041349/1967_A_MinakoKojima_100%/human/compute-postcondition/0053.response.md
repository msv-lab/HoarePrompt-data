The code snippet `ans += k // (i + 1)` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `dif`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`**.
