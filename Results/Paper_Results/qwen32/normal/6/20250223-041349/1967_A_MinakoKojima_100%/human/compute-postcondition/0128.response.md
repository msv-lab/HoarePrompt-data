Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` remains unchanged, and `k` is 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else statement is executed, considering the given precondition and the behavior described in the if part.
