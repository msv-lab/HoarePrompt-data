Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, then `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `0 // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is not 0, or if `dif` is 0, then `ans` and `res` remain unchanged.**
