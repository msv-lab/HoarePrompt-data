The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

The states `dif`, `a`, `k`, `ans`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`**
