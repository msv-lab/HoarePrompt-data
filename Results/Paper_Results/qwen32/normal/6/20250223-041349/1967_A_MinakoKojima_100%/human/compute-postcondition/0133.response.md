The code snippet `res += k % n` increments the variable `res` by the remainder of the division of `k` by `n`. The values of `ans`, `k`, and the condition `k % n` are not altered by this operation. The only change is in the value of `res`, which is increased by `k % n`.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient, plus `k // n`; `k` is not 0; `res` is the number of iterations where `dif` was 0 plus `k % n`.**
