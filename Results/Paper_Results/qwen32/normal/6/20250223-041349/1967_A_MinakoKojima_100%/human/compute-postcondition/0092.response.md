The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. Therefore, none of the variables `ans`, `k`, `ans_list`, `a`, `n`, `dif`, or `res` are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans_list` contains the previous `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0, and `res` is `n - 1`.**
