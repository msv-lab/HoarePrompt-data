In the given task, the for loop iterates over `ans_list`, which contains the final calculated `ans` values for each test case. The only variable in the loop head is `a`, which represents each element in `ans_list` during each iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. The state of `a` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because `a` is assigned the value of each element in `ans_list` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ans_list` contains at least one element.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element**
