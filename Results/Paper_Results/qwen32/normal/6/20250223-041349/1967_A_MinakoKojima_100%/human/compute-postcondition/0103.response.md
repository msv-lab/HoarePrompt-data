Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `ans` is `ans + dif`; `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from it. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans`) retain their previous conditions or values as described in the initial state.
