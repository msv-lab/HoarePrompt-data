Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `k` is the value read from the input, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, then `res` is `n - 1`.**
