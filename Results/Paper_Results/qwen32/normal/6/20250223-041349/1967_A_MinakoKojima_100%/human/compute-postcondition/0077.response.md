The given code snippet calculates the difference between two consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and assigns it to the variable `dif`. Specifically, it calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The variables `ans`, `k`, `res`, and `ans_list` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `dif`, which is now assigned the value `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `k` is the value read from the input, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `n` must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
