The code snippet `ans += dif` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dif` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged unless specified by the code. Since `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` will be updated to its previous value plus this difference.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`.**
