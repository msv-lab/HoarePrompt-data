The code snippet `res -= 1` directly decrements the value of `res` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `ans`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `res - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `res - 1`; `ans` is `ans + dif`; `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is decreased by 1, and all other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
