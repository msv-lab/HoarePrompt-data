The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type. For each test case, it computes a value based on the given inputs and prints the result. The computation involves sorting the list of card counts, adjusting the counts based on the value of `k`, and then calculating a final value that includes adjustments for the remaining `k` and the differences in card counts.
