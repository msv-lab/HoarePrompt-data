Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is further updated to `res + k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`) retain their previous definitions and conditions.
