The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The precondition that `t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0 is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
