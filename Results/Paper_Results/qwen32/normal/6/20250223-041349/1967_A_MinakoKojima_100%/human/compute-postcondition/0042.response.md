Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is also increased by `k % (i + 1)`.**
