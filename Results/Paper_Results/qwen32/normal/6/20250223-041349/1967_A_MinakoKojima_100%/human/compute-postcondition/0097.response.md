Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0]` if `k < dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + dif`. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element. `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
