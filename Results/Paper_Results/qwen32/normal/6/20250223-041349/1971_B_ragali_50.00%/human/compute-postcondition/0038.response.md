The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`, and the length of `a` is greater than 1.
- `i` is the last character in the string `s`.

The Python code snippet contains the following print statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, or `i`. It will simply print the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
