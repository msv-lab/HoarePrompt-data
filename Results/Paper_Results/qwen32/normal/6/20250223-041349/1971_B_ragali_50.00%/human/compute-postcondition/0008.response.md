The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over each character in the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and how it will change as the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current character being processed in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Here are the steps to determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. The loop variable `i` will be updated to the next character in the string `s`.
2. The string `s` and the integer `t` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `i` is the next character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, the next character in the string `s` will be the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces and must have at least 1 character; `a` is a set containing the element `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one.**
