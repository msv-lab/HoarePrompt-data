You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each of the `t` iterations, the program reads a string `s` from the input, checks if the string consists of more than one unique character, and prints 'YES' if it does. If `s` has more than one unique character, the program then checks if `s` is a palindrome. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints the reverse of `s`. If `s` consists of only one unique character, the program prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
Given a string `s`, the task is to check if it's possible to rearrange its characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If such a rearrangement is possible, the program should output "YES" followed by one such rearrangement. If it's not possible, the program should output "NO".

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Unique Character Check:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are multiple unique characters in the string, and thus a rearrangement is possible.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The program attempts to create a new string `newstr` by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half.
   - It also considers the reverse of `s` (`isreverse`).
   - If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, it prints `newstr`.
   - If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, it prints `isreverse`.
   - If neither `newstr` nor `isreverse` is a valid rearrangement, it falls back to printing `newstr` again (which might not be correct in this scenario).

4. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1 (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), it outputs "NO" because no rearrangement can result in a different string.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The logic for rearranging the string is flawed. Simply concatenating the second half with the first half might not always result in a different string, especially for strings with a length that is not even.
   - The fallback to printing `newstr` again if neither `newstr` nor `isreverse` is valid is incorrect.

2. **Reverse String Check:**
   - The program checks if the reverse of the string is different from the original, which is a valid rearrangement, but it doesn't handle all cases correctly.

### Correctness
Based on the analysis, the program does not always provide a correct rearrangement of the string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
