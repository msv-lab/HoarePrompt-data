The code snippet `a = set()` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty set, discarding its previous value which was a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. The variables `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string (newly inputted and stripped of leading/trailing spaces); `a` is an empty set; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
