Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer value read from the input, while the condition 1 <= `t` <= 1000 remains valid. The variable `s` and its properties are not affected by this code snippet.
