Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `a < b < c`, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and either `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`.**
