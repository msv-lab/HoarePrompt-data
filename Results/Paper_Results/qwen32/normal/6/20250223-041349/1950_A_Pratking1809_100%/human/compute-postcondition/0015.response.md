The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`.
2. The string 'PEAK' is directly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are used in this statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
