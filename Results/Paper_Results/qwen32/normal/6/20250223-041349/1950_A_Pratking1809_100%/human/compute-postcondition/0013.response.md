The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. The code does not affect the values of `t`, `q`, or `i`. 

After the execution of the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
