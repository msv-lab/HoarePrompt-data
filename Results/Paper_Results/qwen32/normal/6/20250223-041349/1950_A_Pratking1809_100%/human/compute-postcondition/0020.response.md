The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state mentions that `t`, `q`, and `i` are already defined with specific conditions, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers read from the input, while `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.
