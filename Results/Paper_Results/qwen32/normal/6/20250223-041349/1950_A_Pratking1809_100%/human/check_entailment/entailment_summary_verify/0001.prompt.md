You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each ranging from 0 to 9) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given problem requires us to determine if three given digits form a "stair," a "peak," or neither. The conditions for these are clearly defined as:
- A "stair" is when the digits satisfy the condition a < b < c.
- A "peak" is when the digits satisfy the condition a < b > c.
- If neither of these conditions is met, the digits form "NONE."

The provided program follows these requirements step-by-step:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits.
3. It then checks if the digits form a "stair" using the condition `a < b < c`.
4. If the first condition is not met, it checks if the digits form a "peak" using the condition `a < b > c`.
5. If neither of the conditions is satisfied, it outputs "NONE".

The program correctly uses logical conditions to determine the output and handles all possible cases as per the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
