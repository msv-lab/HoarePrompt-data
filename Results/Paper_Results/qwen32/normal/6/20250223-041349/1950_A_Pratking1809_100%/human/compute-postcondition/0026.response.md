Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `q`. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, and for each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` were read from the input and the appropriate condition (`STAIR`, `PEAK`, or `NONE`) was printed based on the comparison of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `q`. For each of the `q` iterations, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints whether they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" pattern. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
