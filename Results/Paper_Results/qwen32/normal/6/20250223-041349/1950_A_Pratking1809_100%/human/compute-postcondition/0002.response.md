The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. After the execution of the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the integers provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `q`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
