The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to the value of `n`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is overwritten by the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `count` is 2, `countmins` is count_final - 1, `g` is n / count_final - count_final + 1, and `ans` is n.**
