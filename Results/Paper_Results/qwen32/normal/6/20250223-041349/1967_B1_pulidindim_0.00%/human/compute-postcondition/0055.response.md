The value of `countmins` is updated to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 4, `countmins` will be updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 3 - 2`, and `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its previous value.**
