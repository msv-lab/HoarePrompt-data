You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `i` is `t`, `n` and `m` are the values from the last test case, `count` is the final value that caused the inner loop to terminate for the last test case, `ans` is the final result printed for the last test case, `countmins` is `count - 1` for the last iteration of the last test case, and `g` is `n / count - countmins` for the last iteration of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
