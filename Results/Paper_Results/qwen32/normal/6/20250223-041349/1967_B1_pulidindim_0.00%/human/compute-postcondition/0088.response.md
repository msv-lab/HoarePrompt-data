Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
