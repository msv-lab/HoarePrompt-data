Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count - 2`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` has been updated to `count - 1`, which means `countmins` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
