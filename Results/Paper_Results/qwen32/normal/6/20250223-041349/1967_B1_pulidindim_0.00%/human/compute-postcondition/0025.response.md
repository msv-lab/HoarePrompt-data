Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` must be less than `m`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + ((n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1)`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `n / count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
