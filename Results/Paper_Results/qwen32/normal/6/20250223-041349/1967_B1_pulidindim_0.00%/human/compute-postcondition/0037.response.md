To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `count <= m`. The variables `count` and `m` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `count` is 2
- `ans` is `n`
- `countmins` is `count - 1`
- `g` is `n / count - countmins`

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `count <= m` must be true. Initially, `count` is 2. Therefore, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

No other state needs to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `count` and `m`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, and `g` is `n / count - countmins`**
