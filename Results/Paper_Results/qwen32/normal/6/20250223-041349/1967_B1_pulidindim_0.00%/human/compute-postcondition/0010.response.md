Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, then `g` is less than `countmins`. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.**
