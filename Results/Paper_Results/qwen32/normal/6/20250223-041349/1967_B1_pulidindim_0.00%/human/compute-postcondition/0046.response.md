To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. The loop condition is `count <= m`. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `count` and `m` to ensure that `count` is still less than or equal to `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is at least 2
- `count` is 3
- `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`
- `countmins` is 1
- `g` is `n / count - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `count` is currently 3, `m` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition `count <= m`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`. We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / count - 1`**
