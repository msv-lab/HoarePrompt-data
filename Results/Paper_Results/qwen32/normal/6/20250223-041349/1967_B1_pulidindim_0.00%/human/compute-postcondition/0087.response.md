The value of `g` is recalculated to be `n / count`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)`**.
