To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and how they interact within the described logic.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `count` is initialized to `m + 1` if the loop runs until `count` exceeds `m`.
- `ans` is the accumulated value after all valid iterations.
- `countmins` is `count - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as `n / count - countmins`.
- The loop breaks if `g` is less than `countmins`.

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet does not include the loop or the logic that modifies `ans`. Therefore, we can only make inferences based on the initial state and the given conditions.

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `count` is initialized to `m + 1` if the loop runs until it exceeds `m`.
   - `countmins` is `count - 1`, which means `countmins` will be `m` if the loop runs until `count` is `m + 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.

2. **Accumulated Value `ans`:**
   - Since the exact loop and how `ans` is accumulated is not provided, we can only infer that `ans` is an accumulated value based on some condition or calculation within the loop.
   - The loop runs until `count` exceeds `m`, and `ans` is presumably updated within each iteration of the loop.

3. **Condition to Break the Loop:**
   - The loop breaks if `g` is less than `countmins`. Given the initialization, `g` is `n / count - countmins`. If `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, and `g` is `n / (m + 1) - m`.
   - If `n / (m + 1) - m` is less than `m`, the loop breaks.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact loop and the logic that modifies `ans`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure and the given information, we know that `ans` is an accumulated value from the loop.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated value after all valid iterations of the loop)**
