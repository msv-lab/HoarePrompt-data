Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `n / 3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
