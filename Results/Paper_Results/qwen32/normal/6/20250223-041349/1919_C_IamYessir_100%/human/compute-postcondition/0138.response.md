Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is greater than `y`. Additionally, `y` is less than `lit[i]`.**
