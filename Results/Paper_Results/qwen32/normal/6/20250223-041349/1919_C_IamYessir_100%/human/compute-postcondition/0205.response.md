The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This changes the state of `b` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.

After the execution of `b.append(lit[i])`, the state of `b` changes because a new element is added to it. The values of `a`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `b` was previously empty and now `y` will be the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`).

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before appending `lit[i]`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
