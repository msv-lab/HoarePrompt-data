Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing its original elements plus `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. `x` is positive infinity if `a` was initially an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[i]`.**
