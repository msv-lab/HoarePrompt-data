Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x > y`, then if `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `a`. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. If `x < y`, `lit[i]` is added to list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or if `lit[i] > y`. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. `x` is set to the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
