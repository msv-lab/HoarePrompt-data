Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. Otherwise, there is no change to `a` or `x`.**
