Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If the list `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**

In simpler terms: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains greater than 0, `lit` remains a list of integers from the input, `cp` remains 0, and `i` is incremented by 2. The value of `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` or `lit` is empty; otherwise, it is the last element of `a` or `lit`, respectively. The value of `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, it is the last element of `b`.**
