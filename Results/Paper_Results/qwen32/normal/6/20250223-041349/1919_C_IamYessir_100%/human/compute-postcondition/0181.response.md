The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.

After the code snippet is executed, `a` will no longer be empty (if it was empty before), and its last element will be `lit[i]`.

The value of `x` will be updated to `lit[i]` because `x` is assigned the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.

The other variables (`b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list that includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
