The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`, as it now includes an additional element. None of the other variables are directly modified by this operation.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`, `y >= lit[i]`. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is positive infinity. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
