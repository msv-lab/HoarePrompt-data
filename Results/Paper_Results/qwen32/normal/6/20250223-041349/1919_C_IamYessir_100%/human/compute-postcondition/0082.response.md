Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `b` is the list `b` with `lit[i]` appended to it and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If none of the above conditions are met, the values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
