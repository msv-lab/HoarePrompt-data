The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `lit[i]` at the end.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers from the input.
- `cp` is 0.
- `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise it is the last element of `b`.
- `x` is greater than `y`.
- `lit[i]` is such that `x >= lit[i] > y`.

After the execution of `a.append(lit[i])`:
- The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` as its last element.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` before the append operation, and the new element `lit[i]` is not necessarily greater than the previous `x`.
- The value of `y` remains unchanged because `y` is not affected by the operation on `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before the append, or the last element of `a` before the append if `a` was not empty, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise it is the last element of `b`, `x` is greater than `y`, `lit[i]` is such that `x >= lit[i] > y`.**
