Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` was 0, or the last element of list `a` before any append operation otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]`, `lit[3]` is appended to `a`. If `x` is less than `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `y`, `lit[3]` is appended to `a`. If `x` is less than `lit[3]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, `lit[3]` is appended to `b`.**
