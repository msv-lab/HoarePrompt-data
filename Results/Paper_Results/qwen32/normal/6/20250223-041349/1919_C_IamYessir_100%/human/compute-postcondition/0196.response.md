The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. The variable `b` is modified, and all other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `a` and `b` can be either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` and `y` are determined based on whether `a` and `b` are empty or not.

The only change is that `b` now contains an additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, and `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
