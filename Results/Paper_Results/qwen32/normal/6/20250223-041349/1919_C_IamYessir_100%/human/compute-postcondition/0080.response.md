Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, the values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
