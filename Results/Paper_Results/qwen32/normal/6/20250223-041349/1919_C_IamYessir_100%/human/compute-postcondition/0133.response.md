The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `cp`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
