Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` now contains the additional element `lit[i]`.**
