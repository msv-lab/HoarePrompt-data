Postcondition: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5, `s` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`.**

This means that the list `a` remains [5, 8, 6], the list `b` remains [3, 2], `cp` remains 0, `n` remains 5, and `s` remains 0. Additionally, the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.
