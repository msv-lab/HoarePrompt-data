Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, and `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list. Additionally, the length of `b` is 0.**
