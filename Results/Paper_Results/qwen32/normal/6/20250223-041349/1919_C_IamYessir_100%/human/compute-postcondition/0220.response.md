Postcondition: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` remains 0, `i` is 3. In this case, since `a[i]` is 6 and `a[i - 1]` is 8, `s` remains 0. However, if `a[i]` were greater than `a[i - 1]`, `s` would be set to 2.**

Given the specific values provided in the precondition, `a[i]` (which is 6) is not greater than `a[i - 1]` (which is 8), so `s` remains 0. The postcondition accounts for both scenarios: if `a[i]` were greater than `a[i - 1]`, `s` would be set to 2, otherwise, it remains 0.
