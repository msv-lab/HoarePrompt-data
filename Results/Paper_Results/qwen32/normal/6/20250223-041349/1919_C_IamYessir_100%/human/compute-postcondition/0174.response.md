The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This will change the state of `b` by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` was empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` as its last element.**
