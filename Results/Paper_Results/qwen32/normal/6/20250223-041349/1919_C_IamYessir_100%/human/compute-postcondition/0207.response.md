Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. If `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > y` and `y` was `float('inf')`, `y` is now `lit[i]` and `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > y` and `y` was not `float('inf')`, `y` and `b` remain unchanged. If `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is now `lit[i]` and `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was not `float('inf')` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is now `lit[i]` and `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. Otherwise, if `lit[i] <= y`, `y` and `b` remain unchanged.**
