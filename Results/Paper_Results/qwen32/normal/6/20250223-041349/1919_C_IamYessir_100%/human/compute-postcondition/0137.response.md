The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This affects the state of `b` directly by adding a new element to it. The other variables (`a`, `cp`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless `b` was previously empty, in which case `y` would be updated to the newly appended value. However, since the precondition specifies that `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` will not change if `b` was not empty.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is not an empty list (it contains all previous elements of `b` plus `lit[i]`), `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` was an empty list and `lit[i]` is positive infinity, otherwise `y` remains the last element of `b` before the append operation, and `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
