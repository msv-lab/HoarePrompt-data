Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` was equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `x` was not equal to `y` and `x < y`, then if `x >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `x < lit[i]`, `a` remains unchanged. If `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was previously empty or `y` was `float('inf')`. If `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was not `float('inf')` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `y` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.**
