Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so if `s` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `s` was 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
