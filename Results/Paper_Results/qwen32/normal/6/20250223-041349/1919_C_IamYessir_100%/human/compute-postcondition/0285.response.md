The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables (`iterations`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is `float('inf')`**
