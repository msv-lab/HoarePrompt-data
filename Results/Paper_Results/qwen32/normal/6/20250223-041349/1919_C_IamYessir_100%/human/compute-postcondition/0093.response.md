To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the lists `a` and `b` are populated based on the input list `lit`.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it compares the last elements of lists `a` and `b` (or `float('inf')` if the lists are empty) with the current element of `lit`. Depending on the comparison, it appends the current element to either list `a` or list `b`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` and `b` are initially empty.
   - `x` and `y` are initially `float('inf')`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element in `lit`, the loop compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (or `float('inf')` if the lists are empty) with the current element.
   - If `x > y`, the current element is appended to `b` if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, the current element is appended to `a`.
   - If `x == y`, the current element is appended to `a`.
   - If `x < y`, the current element is appended to `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, the current element is appended to `b`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `a` and `b` will contain elements from `lit` based on the above conditions.
   - `x` will be the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty.
   - `y` will be the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.
   - `t` and `cp` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state can be described as:

- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `lit` remains the same as the initial value.
- `a` and `b` are populated based on the conditions described above.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty.
- `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers populated based on the conditions described, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.**
