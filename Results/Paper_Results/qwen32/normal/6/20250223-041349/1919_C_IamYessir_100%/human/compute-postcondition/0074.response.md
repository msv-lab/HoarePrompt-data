The code snippet assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This change impacts the variable `y` directly, while the other variables remain unaffected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If the list `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. `y` is `float('inf')`.**
