Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0. If `x` was equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, and both `x` and `y` are updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` maintain their original values or are updated based on the conditions: `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, if `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, it is appended to `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `a`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, it is appended to `b` as its last element.**

This postcondition summarizes the outcomes of both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, and `cp` remain consistent with the precondition, while `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are updated according to the specified conditions.
