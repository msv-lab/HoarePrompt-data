The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. If the loop has just completed an iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 from its value at the start of that iteration. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop is about to start the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
