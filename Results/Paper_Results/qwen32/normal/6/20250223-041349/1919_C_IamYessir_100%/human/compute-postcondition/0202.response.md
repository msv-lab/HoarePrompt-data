The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.

After the code executes, `a` will have the new element `lit[i]` appended to it. This change affects `x` because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` has `lit[i]` appended to it; `b` is either empty or not; `cp` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before the append, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`; if `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
