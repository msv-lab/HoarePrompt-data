The given code snippet `s += 1` attempts to increment the variable `s` by 1. However, the initial state provided does not include a variable `s`. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `s` as it is not defined in the initial state. Assuming that `s` should be included in the initial state to make the task solvable, let's assume `s` was initially 0 for the sake of this example.

Given this assumption, the updated value of `s` would be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5, `i` is 2, `s` is 1**.
