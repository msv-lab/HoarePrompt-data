The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
