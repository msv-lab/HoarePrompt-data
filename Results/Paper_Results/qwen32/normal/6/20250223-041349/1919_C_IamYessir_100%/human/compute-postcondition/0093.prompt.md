Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, the following conditions apply: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is less than `y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` remains `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, or the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty. If `x` is not greater than `y`, the following conditions apply: if `x` was equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, and both `x` and `y` are updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` maintain their original values or are updated based on the conditions: `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, if `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, it is appended to `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `a`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, it is appended to `b` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x > y`, then if `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to the list `a`. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. If `x < y`, `lit[i]` is added to list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or if `lit[i] > y`. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. `x` is set to the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If `x > y`, then if `y >= lit[i]`, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `b` is the list `b` with `lit[i]` appended to it and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x == y`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x < y`, then if `x >= lit[i]`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty. If `x < lit[i]`, then if `lit[i] > y`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, with `y` remaining unchanged. If `lit[i] <= y`, then `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`. If none of the above conditions are met, the values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. If the list `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
