To determine what will be printed by the `print(X)` statement, we need to understand the value of `X` based on the given initial state.

From the initial state, we have:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`.

The `//` operator in Python is the floor division operator, which divides the first operand by the second and then rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can only describe `X` in terms of `A`.

Therefore, `X` will be the integer result of `A` divided by 2, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Output: **X (where X is the integer result of A // 2)**
