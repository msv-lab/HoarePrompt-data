Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `B * 2 < C`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `A` is even, no additional changes are made. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
