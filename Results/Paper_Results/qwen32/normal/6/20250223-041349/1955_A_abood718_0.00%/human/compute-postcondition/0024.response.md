To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the variables `A` and `B` as they are the ones being used in the `print` statement.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

From the given initial state, we know that `A` and `B` are integers obtained from the input. However, the specific values of `A` and `B` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `A` and `B`.

The output will be the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers obtained from the input)**
