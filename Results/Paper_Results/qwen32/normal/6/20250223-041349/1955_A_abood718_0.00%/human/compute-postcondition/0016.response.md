To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(A * C / 2))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the given conditions.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the output of the print statement.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. These variables also do not affect the output of the print statement.
3. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
4. There are conditions based on the values of `B` and `C`:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, then the current value of `B` remains unchanged.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, then `A` remains unchanged.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is odd, then `X` is set to `A // 2`, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, `X` and `i` are not mentioned in the print statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(int(A * C / 2))` directly depends on the values of `A` and `C`. The value of `B` does not affect the output of this statement.

### Output Description:
The output will be the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`. Since we don't have specific values for `A` and `C`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers obtained from the input)**
