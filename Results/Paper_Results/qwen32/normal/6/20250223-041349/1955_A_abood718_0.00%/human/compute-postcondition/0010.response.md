To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. (These variables are also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore them for this task.)
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
   - `A` is an odd integer.
   - `X` is `A // 2`. Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will be the floor division of `A` by 2, which means it will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `X * C + B`.

3. **Substituting `X` in the expression:**
   - Since `X = A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Given the information, we cannot compute the exact numerical value without the specific values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, B is an integer, and C is an integer such that B * 2 ≥ C)**
