You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on the conditions involving these integers. Specifically, it prints `A * B` if `B * 2` is less than `C`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The problematic part of the code is:

```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```

Here, the code prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating and printing the total cost. This is incorrect and should be removed. Additionally, the calculation for the total cost when `A` is odd is incorrect. It should be:

```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X * C + B)
```

Let's test the code with an example to see the issue:

For the input:
```
1
3 5 11
```

The correct output should be `15` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles) results in a total of `11 + 5 = 16` burles. However, the given code will print `1` (which is `X`) and then `16` (which is `X * C + B`), which is incorrect.

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            Y = A % 2
            print(X * C + Y * B)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum cost for any number of yogurts `A`, given the prices `B` and `C`.
