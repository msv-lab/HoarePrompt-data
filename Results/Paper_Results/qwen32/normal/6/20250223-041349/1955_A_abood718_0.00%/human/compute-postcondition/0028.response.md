To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their ranges**:
   - `t`: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n`, `a`, `b`: integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\)
   - `A`, `B`, `C`: integers obtained from the input (their specific values are not given, but they are defined)
   - `i`: incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned in the initial state)
   - `X`: defined as `A // 2` (integer division of `A` by 2)

2. **Expression to be printed**:
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`

3. **Calculating the output**:
   - `X` is `A // 2`, meaning `X` is the integer part of `A` divided by 2.
   - The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`, which translates to `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the expression in terms of the given variables.

**Output Description**:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers obtained from the input)**
