The code snippet `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. The other variables `s` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element, and `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration and must be less than the length of `s`, these conditions remain valid after the code execution.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, and it must be less than the length of `s`; `n` is incremented by 1.**
