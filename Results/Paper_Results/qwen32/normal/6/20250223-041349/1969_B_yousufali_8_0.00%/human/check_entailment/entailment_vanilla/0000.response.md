Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should appear before all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is equal to the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:
1. The optimal strategy is to move all '1's to the end of the string.
2. For every '0' encountered after a '1', we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the front, incurring a cost.
3. The cost of moving a '0' to the front increases with the number of '1's encountered before it.

### Correct Algorithm:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`). Each time we encounter a '0' after having encountered at least one '1', we add `n + 1` to the total cost. This is because the substring from the first '1' to the current '0' needs to be cyclically shifted.

### Given Program Analysis:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is supposed to handle a single test case.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect for reading a binary string. It should be `s = input().strip()` to read the string as is.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost based on the given observations. However, due to the incorrect input handling, the function will not work as intended.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in `func_1`, particularly the incorrect input handling, the program cannot be considered correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
