### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the code step-by-step to determine whether the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Transform a binary string into a non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
- **Cost**: The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
  - Initializes `n` (count of 1s) and `ans` (total cost) to 0.
  - Iterates through the list:
    - Increments `n` when encountering a `1`.
    - When encountering a `0` and `n` is not 0, adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - Prints `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` `t` times for each test case.

#### Annotations Recap:
- **State of `func_1`**:
  - `n` is the count of 1s encountered so far.
  - `ans` is the sum of `(length of each sequence of 1s + 1)` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.
- **State of `func_2`**:
  - Calls `func_1` `t` times.

#### Evaluation:
- The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The cost is based on the length of the substring being shifted.
- The provided code does not correctly calculate the cost for cyclic shifts. Instead, it calculates a different metric: the sum of `(length of each sequence of 1s + 1)` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.
- This metric does not accurately represent the minimum cost to sort the string. For example, in the test case `101011`, the correct minimum cost is 5, but the provided code would not yield this result.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cyclic shifts.

### Final: **False**
