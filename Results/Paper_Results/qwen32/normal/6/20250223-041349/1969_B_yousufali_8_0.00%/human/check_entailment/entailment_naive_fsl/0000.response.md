Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Let's analyze the functions `func_1` and `func_2`:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over the list `s`. If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The provided code does not correctly handle the cost calculation for cyclic shifts. The cost calculation should consider the length of the substring being shifted, which is not correctly implemented in `func_1`.

For example, consider the test case `101011`:
- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as shown in the problem description.
- However, the provided code would not yield this result. The code's logic is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
