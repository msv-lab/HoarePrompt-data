To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1()` and its impact on the variable `t`. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, I will assume that `func_1()` does not modify `t` or introduce any new variables. If `func_1()` does not affect `t`, then `t` remains unchanged.

Given this assumption, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**.
