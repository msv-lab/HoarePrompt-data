Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, and it must be less than the length of `s`. If `s[i]` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to include `n + 1`, while the list `s`, the index `i`, and the counter `n` retain their previous states with the exception that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `s[i]` was 1, `n` would have been incremented by 1 before the update to `ans`.
