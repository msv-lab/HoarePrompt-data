To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given output states for the first three iterations.

The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

Here, `t` is a positive integer input by the user, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The loop will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times.

Given the output states for the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `func_1()` has been executed once.
- After 2 iterations: `func_1()` has been executed twice.
- After 3 iterations: `func_1()` has been executed three times.

Following this pattern, after all `t` iterations, `func_1()` will have been executed `t` times.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations would be:

Output State: **`func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

Natural language description: After the loop finishes executing, the function `func_1()` will have been called a total of `t` times, where `t` is the initial positive integer input by the user within the range of 1 to 10,000.
