The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the index of the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `s`.

Given that `s` has at least 1 element, and assuming the loop has processed up to the element at index `i`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element. `n` retains its original value. `i` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of `s`.**
