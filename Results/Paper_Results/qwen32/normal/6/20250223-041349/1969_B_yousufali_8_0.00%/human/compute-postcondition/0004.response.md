Since the code snippet provided is simply `func_1()`, and there is no information given about what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine how it affects the variables in the initial state. The only thing we know is that `t` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, and `func_1()` has already been executed once.

Therefore, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not alter the variable `t` or any other variables not mentioned in the initial state. As a result, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4**.
