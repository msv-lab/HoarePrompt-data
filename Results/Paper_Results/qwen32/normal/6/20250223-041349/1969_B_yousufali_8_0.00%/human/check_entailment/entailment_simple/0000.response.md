### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input, converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s), and initializes `n` and `ans` to 0.

2. **Logic in `func_1()`:**
   - It iterates through the binary string.
   - It counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`).
   - Whenever a 0 is encountered and `n` (the count of 1s) is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - The value `n + 1` represents the cost of shifting a substring that ends with the current 0 and includes all the preceding 1s.

3. **Explanation of Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost to move a substring ending with a 0 and containing `n` 1s to the left is `n + 1` because you need to cyclically shift the substring of length `n + 1` (including the 0).
   - By summing these costs for all such occurrences, the program calculates the total minimum cost to sort the string.

4. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - For the string `11000`, the program correctly identifies two sequences of 1s followed by 0s:
     - The first sequence is `11` followed by `0` (cost = 2 + 1 = 3).
     - The second sequence is `11` followed by `0` (cost = 2 + 1 = 3).
     - The third sequence is `1` followed by `0` (cost = 1 + 1 = 2).
     - Total cost = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. However, the provided output for this case is 9, suggesting a different interpretation or edge case handling might be required.
   - For the string `101011`, the program identifies the following sequences:
     - `1` followed by `0` (cost = 1 + 1 = 2).
     - `1` followed by `0` (cost = 1 + 1 = 2).
     - `11` followed by `0` (cost = 2 + 1 = 3).
     - Total cost = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. However, the provided output is 5, indicating a discrepancy in the cost calculation logic.

### Conclusion:

Given the discrepancies in the cost calculation logic as demonstrated by the example walkthrough, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
