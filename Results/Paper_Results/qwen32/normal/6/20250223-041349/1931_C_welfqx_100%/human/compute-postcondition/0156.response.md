The code snippet `symb2 = onum[0]` assigns the first element of the list `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `onum[0]` is the last element of the original list `num`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `ck` is 1; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is 1.**
