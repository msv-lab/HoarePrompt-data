The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of the variable `cn` by 1. Given the initial state, `cn` is initially 1. After the operation, `cn` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `cn` is 2, and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
