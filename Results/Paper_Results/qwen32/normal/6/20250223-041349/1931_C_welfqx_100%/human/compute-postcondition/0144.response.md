Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, `j` is `j + 1` from the previous iteration. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
