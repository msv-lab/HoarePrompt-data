To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop are completed, we need to understand how the loop behaves based on the given conditions and the initial state.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range `n - 1` times. In each iteration, it checks if the current element `num[i]` is equal to the next element `num[i + 1]`. If they are equal, it increments the counter `cn`. If they are not equal, the loop breaks.

### Initial State:
- `t`: an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n`: an input integer
- `f`: 1
- `num`: a list of integers obtained from the input
- `j`: `n - 2`
- `onum`: a reversed copy of `num`
- `symb1`: the first element of `num`
- `symb2`: the last element of `num`
- `cn`: 1
- `ck`: 1

### Loop Execution:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times.
- It increments `cn` by 1 for each consecutive pair of equal elements in `num`.
- The loop breaks if it encounters a pair of non-equal elements.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will run until it either checks all `n - 1` pairs or finds a pair of non-equal elements.
- `cn` will hold the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop is determined by the value of `cn`, which counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes, `cn` will tell us how many consecutive elements starting from the first element of `num` are equal. All other variables remain unchanged.
