Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the output will be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `num` to make all remaining elements equal.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the program determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `num` so that all remaining elements are the same. This is achieved by checking the longest sequence of equal elements from the start and the end of the list, and then deciding whether these sequences can be combined if they share the same element. The output for each test case is printed, and the final state of the program reflects that all `t` test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been generated.
