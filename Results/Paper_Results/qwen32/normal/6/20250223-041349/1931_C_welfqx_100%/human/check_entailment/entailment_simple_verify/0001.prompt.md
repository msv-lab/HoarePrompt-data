You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
The task is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation consists of selecting a subarray and assigning a value to all its elements. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through multiple test cases. For each test case, it first checks if all elements in the array are already equal. If they are, the cost is 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the cost by considering the longest sequence of equal elements from the start and the end of the array.

The program uses the following logic:
1. **Check if all elements are the same**: If all elements are the same, the cost is 0.
2. **Calculate the longest sequence of equal elements from the start**: It counts how many elements from the beginning of the array are the same.
3. **Calculate the longest sequence of equal elements from the end**: It counts how many elements from the end of the array are the same.
4. **Combine sequences if they have the same element**: If the first and last sequences have the same element, it combines their lengths.
5. **Calculate the minimum cost**: The minimum cost is the total number of elements minus the length of the longest sequence (or combined sequence).

### Correctness Evaluation
The program correctly handles cases where all elements are the same, returning a cost of 0. For other cases, it attempts to minimize the cost by considering the longest sequences of equal elements from both ends. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum cost in all scenarios.

### Counterexample
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The program will calculate the longest sequences from the start and end as `[1]` and `[1]` respectively, leading to a cost of `5 - 1 = 4`. However, the optimal solution is to change the middle element to either `1` or `3`, resulting in a cost of `3 - 2 = 1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for all possible arrays. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
