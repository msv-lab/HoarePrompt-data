Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `i` is 0. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
