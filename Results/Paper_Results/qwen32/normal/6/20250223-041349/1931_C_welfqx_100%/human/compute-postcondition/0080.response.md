Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached, `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
