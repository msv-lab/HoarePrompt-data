The given Python code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`. This line will overwrite the previous value of `n` with a new integer value obtained from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1`**
