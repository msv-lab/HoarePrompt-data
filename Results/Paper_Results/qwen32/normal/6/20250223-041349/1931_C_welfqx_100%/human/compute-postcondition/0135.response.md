Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, `r` is `r + 1`, `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `r`, and `num[j]` remain the same as they were in the initial state, except that we have now broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
