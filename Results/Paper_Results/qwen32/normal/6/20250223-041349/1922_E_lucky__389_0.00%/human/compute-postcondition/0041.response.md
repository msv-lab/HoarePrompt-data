Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is incremented by 1**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) retain their initial values.
