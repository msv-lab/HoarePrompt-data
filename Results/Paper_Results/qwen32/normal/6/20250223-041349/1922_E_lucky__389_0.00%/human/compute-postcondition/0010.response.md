To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
```

This condition depends on the variables `i` and `x`. Let's analyze the condition:

- `i` is currently 2.
- `x` must be at least 7.

First, let's compute the value of `2 ** (i + 1)` when `i` is 2:
- `2 ** (2 + 1) = 2 ** 3 = 8`.

So, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` becomes:
- `8 <= x + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. Thus:
- `x + 1 >= 8`.
- `x >= 7`.

Since `x` must already be at least 7, this condition is satisfied. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` such that the next iteration's condition is also satisfied. Let's consider the next iteration:

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The condition will then be:
- `2 ** (3 + 1) <= x + 1`.
- `2 ** 4 <= x + 1`.
- `16 <= x + 1`.
- `x >= 15`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 15.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 15; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 2**
