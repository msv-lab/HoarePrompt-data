You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it receives an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. It calculates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to X-1 and outputs the count of these powers minus one, followed by the sequence of powers of 2 (excluding the largest power of 2 used).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
- An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
- The array length should be at most 200.
- If no such array exists, we should output -1.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `X`.
   - It then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1()`:**
   - `x` is decremented by 1 to account for the empty subsequence.
   - The program tries to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 (2^i - 1) to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list that stores the indices `i` such that 2^i - 1 is part of the decomposition.
   - `mx` keeps track of the maximum length of subsequences found.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed based on `subseq_lens` and `mx`.

3. **Output Construction:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` as the array.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Decomposition of `x`:** The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 (2^i - 1). However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The relationship between the decomposition and the number of increasing subsequences is not clearly established.
- **Array Construction:** The array `ansv` is constructed in a way that does not necessarily ensure the number of increasing subsequences equals `X`. The logic for constructing the array based on `subseq_lens` is flawed.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct such an array (i.e., when `X` cannot be represented as a sum of 2^i - 1 for valid `i` values).

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for decomposing `x` and constructing the array based on that decomposition does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
