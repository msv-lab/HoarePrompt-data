Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it receives an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. It calculates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to X-1 and outputs the count of these powers minus one, followed by the sequence of powers of 2 (excluding the largest power of 2 used).**
