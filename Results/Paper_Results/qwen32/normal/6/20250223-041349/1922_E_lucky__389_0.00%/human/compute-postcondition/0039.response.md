The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `i` is 0, after executing the code, `i` will be 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 1**.
