Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
