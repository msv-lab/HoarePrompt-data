You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it receives an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. It calculates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to X-1 and outputs the count of these powers minus one, followed by the sequence of powers of 2 (excluding the largest power of 2 used).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The code seems to be attempting to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructing an array based on these powers, but it does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly X increasing subsequences.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case:

For X = 5, the code should produce an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. One possible correct array could be `[0, 1, 0]`, which has the following increasing subsequences:
1. []
2. [0]
3. [0, 1]
4. [1]
5. [0, 1, 0]

However, the code provided does not guarantee this. Let's examine how the code works for X = 5:

1. X is decremented by 1, so X becomes 4.
2. The code then enters a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to X + 1 (which is 5). It finds that 2^2 = 4 is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5.
3. It appends 2 to `subseq_lens` and subtracts 2^2 - 1 = 3 from X, making X = 1.
4. The loop continues, but since 2^1 = 2 is greater than X + 1 = 2, it breaks out of the loop.
5. The array `ansv` is constructed as `[0, 1]` (since `mx` is 2).
6. The code then appends the values in `subseq_lens` starting from the second element, but since `subseq_lens` only has one element, `ansv` remains `[0, 1]`.

The resulting array `[0, 1]` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences. It has only 4 increasing subsequences:
1. []
2. [0]
3. [1]
4. [0, 1]

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for X = 5, and thus it is incorrect.
