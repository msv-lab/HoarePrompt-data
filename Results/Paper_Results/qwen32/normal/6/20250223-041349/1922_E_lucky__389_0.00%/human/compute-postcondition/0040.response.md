To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18
- `x` is at least 2^58
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59
- `mx` is 0 or 59
- `i` is 1

We need to adjust `i` and `x` such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

Let's analyze the condition:
- `2 ** (i + 1)` means 2 raised to the power of `i + 1`.
- `x + 1` is `x` plus 1.

Since `i` is currently 1, the condition becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `2 ** 2 <= x + 1` or `4 <= x + 1`. Given that `x` is at least 2^58, this condition is already satisfied.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the next iteration, the condition is still satisfied. Let's assume the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and the condition will be `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `2 ** 3 <= x + 1` or `8 <= x + 1`.

Since `x` is at least 2^58, this condition is also satisfied. To ensure the loop can execute one more time after that, we need to check the next condition, which would be `2 ** (3 + 1) <= x + 1` or `2 ** 4 <= x + 1` or `16 <= x + 1`, and so on.

Given that `x` is at least 2^58, all these conditions will be satisfied. Therefore, the only thing we need to ensure is that `i` is incremented correctly.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `x` within the loop, we can assume `x` remains at least 2^58. Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it increments correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is incremented by 1**
