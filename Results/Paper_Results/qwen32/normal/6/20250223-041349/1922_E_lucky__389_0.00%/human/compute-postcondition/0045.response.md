Given the if condition `if (i == 0):` and the precondition, it's clear that the condition `i == 0` is never true based on the provided precondition where `i` is explicitly stated to be 58. However, to follow the task instructions, I will assume the scenario where the if condition is true and derive the postcondition as requested.

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 0.**

In this postcondition, all the initial conditions from the precondition are retained, and the value of `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, reflecting the if condition being true.
