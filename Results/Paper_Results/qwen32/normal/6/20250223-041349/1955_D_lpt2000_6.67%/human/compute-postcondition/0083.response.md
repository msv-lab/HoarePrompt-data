Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `aa`, `m` is less than `n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_aa - D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_bb - D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the `D` Counter object, `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0, and `D[out_aa]` is 0**
