Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` (unchanged), `nabors` must be greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `aa` is a list of integers from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_aa - D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_bb - D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the `D` Counter object, `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is unchanged, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `aa`, `m` is less than `n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the `D` Counter object, `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k` else 0, `E[out_aa]` or `C[out_aa]` is adjusted accordingly based on the initial conditions, and `C[in_aa]` is adjusted accordingly based on the initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is unchanged, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `aa`, `m` is less than `n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the `D` Counter object, `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k` else 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is unchanged, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `aa`, `m` is `m + 1`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `C` and `E` are unchanged, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k` else `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
