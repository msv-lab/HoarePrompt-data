Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` > 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0, and `tot` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `tot` remains unchanged. `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0.**

In simpler terms: **`t` remains the same, `nabors` is reduced by 1 and still greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers with `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers of length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` are Counter objects representing frequencies in `aa` and `bb` respectively. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0, and `tot` is decreased by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
