Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, a list `a` of `n` integers each in the range 1 to 10^6, and a list `b` of `m` integers each in the range 1 to 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
