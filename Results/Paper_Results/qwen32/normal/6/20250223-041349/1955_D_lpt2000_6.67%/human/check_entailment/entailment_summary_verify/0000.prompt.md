You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines how many times a sliding window of size `m` over list `a` can contain at least `k` common elements with list `b`. It prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` that match at least `k` elements of array `b` after rearrangement. Here's a breakdown of the program and why it works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counters:**
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the initial subarray of `a` (of length `m`) and in `b`.
   - It calculates the intersection `D` of these two counters, which contains the minimum count of elements that are common in both.
   - It calculates the differences `E` and `C` which help in updating the counts as the window slides.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - It starts with the initial subarray and checks if the number of matching elements (sum of `D`) is at least `k`.
   - It then slides the window one element to the right in each iteration.
   - For each new element entering the window (`in_aa`) and each element leaving the window (`out_aa`), it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
   - It recalculates the number of matching elements and checks if it is at least `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `m = 1` (subsegments of length 1).
   - It handles cases where `k = m` (all elements in the subsegment must match `b`).
   - It handles cases where `k = 1` (at least one element in the subsegment must match `b`).
   - It handles cases where `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements.
   - It handles cases where `a` and `b` contain elements that do not appear in the other array.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach with counters, ensuring that the solution is efficient even for large inputs (up to `2 * 10^5` elements).

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
