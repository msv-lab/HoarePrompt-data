The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. This input is not related to the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b` as described in the initial state. Therefore, only `nabors` is updated, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.**
