Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a new list of integers with length `n` read from the latest input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the new list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0.**
