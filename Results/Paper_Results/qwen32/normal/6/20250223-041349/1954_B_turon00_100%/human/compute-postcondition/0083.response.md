Postcondition: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 3 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, and `i` is 2.**
