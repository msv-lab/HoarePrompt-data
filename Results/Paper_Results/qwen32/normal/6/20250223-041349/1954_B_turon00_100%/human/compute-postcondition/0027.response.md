Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
2. `n` is an integer.
3. `a` is a list of integers.
4. `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the list `a`.
5. `cnt` is initialized to 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended, or to the length of the last sequence if it hasn't.
6. `ans` is initialized to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
7. Either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`.

### The Code:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans`. Regardless of the initial state described, the `print` statement will output `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
