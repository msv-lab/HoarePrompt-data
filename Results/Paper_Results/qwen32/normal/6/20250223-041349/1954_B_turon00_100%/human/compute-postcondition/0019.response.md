The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
