The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken some value, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but it must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. The value of `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can express the state in terms of the incremented value of `i`. If we denote the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration as `i_new`, then `i_new` is `i + 1` from the previous iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new`, `i` is `i_new`**
