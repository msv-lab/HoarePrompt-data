The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `i_new`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly modified by this code, but the precondition that `n` must be greater than `i_new + 1` and `i` is `i_new + 1` still holds. The value of `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and the newly set `cnt` (which is 0).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new + 1`, `i` is `i_new + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, `cnt` is 0.**
