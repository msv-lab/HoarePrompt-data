The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This action changes the value of `n` to whatever integer the user inputs, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans`.

Given the initial state, `n` was already an input integer, and now it is reassigned to a new input integer. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
