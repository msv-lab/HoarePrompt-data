To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **`t`**: An integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. This variable is not directly relevant to the `ans` variable in the context of the `print(ans)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. It is specified that `n` is not equal to 1.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **`tmp`**: Initialized to `a[0]`, which is the first element of the list `a`.
5. **`cnt`**: Initialized to 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't.
6. **`ans`**: Initialized to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, it is specified that `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is not explicitly defined or calculated in the provided snippet. However, we know the following:
- `ans` is initialized to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is either 0 or the length of a sequence of elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Since we do not have the exact values of the list `a` or the sequence of operations that might update `cnt` and `ans`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions provided:

- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` or 0 if such a sequence has ended.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide for the output is based on these conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt, and cnt is the length of the last sequence of elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` or 0 if such a sequence has ended, and ans is not equal to `n`)**
