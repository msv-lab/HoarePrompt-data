Reasoning: The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic within the program iterates through the array and counts the lengths of contiguous sequences of equal elements. It then determines the smallest such sequence length and uses this to decide the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

However, the program's logic is flawed. The program only considers contiguous sequences of equal elements and calculates the minimum length of such sequences. But to make the array non-beautiful, we need to consider more complex scenarios. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would find the minimum contiguous sequence length as `1` (for the element `5`), but removing just one element (the `5`) is not enough to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, we need to remove all elements except the `5` or remove the `5` and some of the `3`s to break the ability to make all elements the same using the allowed operation.

The correct approach should involve checking if the array can be split into two non-empty parts where no element in one part can be transformed into an element in the other part using the allowed operation. This requires a more sophisticated analysis than just finding the minimum length of contiguous sequences.

Given the current logic, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
