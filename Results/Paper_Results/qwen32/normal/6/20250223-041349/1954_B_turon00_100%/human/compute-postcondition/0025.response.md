The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `cnt` is either 0 (if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended) or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't.

After executing the line `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, `ans` will hold the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`. This means that if `cnt` is less than the current `ans`, `ans` will be updated to `cnt`. Otherwise, `ans` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
