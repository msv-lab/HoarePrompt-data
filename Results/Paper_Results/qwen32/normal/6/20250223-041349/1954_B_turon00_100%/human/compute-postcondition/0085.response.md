The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means that `ans` will now hold the smaller of the two values it was previously holding and the current value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `n`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `a` is the new input list of integers
- `tmp` is `a[0]`
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements starting from `a[0]` that are equal to `a[0]`
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the loop

After executing the code snippet, `ans` is updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements starting from `a[0]` that are equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
