The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means that `ans` will hold the smaller value between its previous value and `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is the input list of integers
- `tmp` is `a[0]`
- `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`
- `ans` is the minimum length of any contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`

After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
