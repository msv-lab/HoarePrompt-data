Postcondition: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements starting from `a[0]` that are equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
