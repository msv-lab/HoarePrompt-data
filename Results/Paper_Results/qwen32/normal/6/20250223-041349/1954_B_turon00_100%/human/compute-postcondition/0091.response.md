Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of the last `a`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp` in the last `a`, `ans` is the minimum length of contiguous sequences of equal elements found across all iterations of the loop. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, the output for that iteration is `-1`; otherwise, it is `ans`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt` will reflect the values from the last iteration. The variable `ans` will hold the smallest length of contiguous sequences of equal elements found in any of the input lists `a` across all iterations. If for any iteration `n` is 1 or the smallest length of contiguous sequences equals `n`, the output for that iteration is `-1`; otherwise, it is the smallest length found.
