The code assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and the condition that the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 remain unchanged. The function `find_max` is expected to return a specific value based on its implementation, which we will denote as the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains all `xor` values with the `bit`-th bit as 0, `xor` is the final XOR of remaining elements, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.**
