You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) as input. It recursively calculates and returns the maximum value between the length of `cur_arr` and the length of a derived list `new_arr` based on XOR operations and bit checks. If certain conditions are met, it returns the result of a recursive call with a decremented `bit` value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `find_max` does not properly handle the bitwise XOR and OR operations to determine the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the cumulative XORs of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of Bitwise Operations**: The function `find_max` is supposed to recursively split the array based on the current bit being considered (from 31 down to 0). It checks if the XOR of the current segment has the current bit set and tries to split the array accordingly. However, the logic for handling the bitwise OR of these segments is not correctly implemented.

2. **Base Case**: The base case of the recursion (`if bit == -1`) returns the length of the current array, which is not necessarily the correct value for `k`. This is because the function should check if the cumulative XOR of the segments is less than or equal to `x` before returning the length of the array.

3. **Incorrect Handling of XOR and OR Operations**: The function `find_max` does not correctly accumulate the XOR values and check the OR of these values against `x`. The logic for handling the OR operation is flawed, and it does not correctly determine the maximum number of segments `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when `x` is 0 or when the array contains only one element.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The array can be split into three segments: [1], [3], [3].
- The cumulative XORs of these segments are: 1, 3, 3.
- The bitwise OR of these cumulative XORs is: 1 | 3 | 3 = 3, which is greater than `x` (2).
- However, the correct segments should be [1], [3, 3], with cumulative XORs: 1, 0, and the bitwise OR of these cumulative XORs is: 1 | 0 = 1, which is less than or equal to `x` (2).

The provided code does not correctly handle this test case, and it will likely fail for other test cases as well due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is `False`.
