The code snippet `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Given that `xor` is equal to `i` and `new_arr` is initially either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]`, after appending `xor` to `new_arr`, `new_arr` will have an additional element `xor` at the end. 

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `cur_arr` is still a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `bit` is still an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is still `i`, `thing1` is still 0, and `i` is still the next element in `cur_arr`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor, xor]` or `[xor, xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
