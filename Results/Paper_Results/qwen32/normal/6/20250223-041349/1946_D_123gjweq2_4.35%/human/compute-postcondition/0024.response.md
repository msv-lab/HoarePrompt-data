Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains all `xor` values with the `bit`-th bit as 0, `xor` is the final XOR of remaining elements, `thing1` is -1, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been changed to -1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
