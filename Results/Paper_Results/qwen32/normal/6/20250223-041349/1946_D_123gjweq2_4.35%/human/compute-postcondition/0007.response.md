The given code snippet `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the variable `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means we need to assume `i` is a variable that holds a specific value for the purpose of this simulation. Since `i` is not provided, let's assume `i` is a non-negative integer (as per the context of the other variables).

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.

The operation `xor ^= i` will update the value of `xor` to be the result of `xor XOR i`. Since `xor` is initially 0, the new value of `xor` will simply be the value of `i`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` is 5 (you can replace 5 with any non-negative integer as per the context).

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 5, `thing1` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `xor` is updated to 5 (assuming `i` is 5), while all other variables remain unchanged.
