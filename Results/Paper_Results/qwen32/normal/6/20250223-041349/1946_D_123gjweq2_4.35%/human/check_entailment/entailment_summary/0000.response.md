Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number \( x \). The function `func_1` and `find_max` do not properly address this requirement.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to solve the problem, but it only calls `find_max` with `bit=31`. This is incorrect because `find_max` should be called with `bit=29` since the maximum value of \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \).
   - The function `func_1` does not use the parameter `x` at all, which is crucial for the problem.

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` is supposed to recursively find the maximum number of segments by checking the bits of the XOR of segments.
   - However, the logic for checking the bits and forming the `new_arr` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The function is trying to split the array into segments based on the XOR values, but it is not correctly ensuring that the bitwise OR of these XOR values is less than or equal to \( x \).
   - The function also incorrectly handles the base case and recursion steps, leading to incorrect results.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
