Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is [5] if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is 0 if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise `xor` remains 5, and `thing1` is 0.**
