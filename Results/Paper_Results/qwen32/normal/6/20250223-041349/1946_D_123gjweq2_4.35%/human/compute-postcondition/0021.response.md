Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0 if the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0, otherwise `xor` remains `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
