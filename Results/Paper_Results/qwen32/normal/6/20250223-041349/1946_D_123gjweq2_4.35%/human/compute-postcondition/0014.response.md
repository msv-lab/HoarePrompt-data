The code appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Since `new_arr` was initially either `[5]` or `[]` based on the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor`, after the append operation, `new_arr` will have `xor` as its last element. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]`, `xor` is the result of `xor ^ i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
