The code snippet sets `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `thing1`, or `i`. The only change is that `xor` is reset to 0.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
