You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) to distribute the bets. However, there are a few issues with the logic that make it incorrect for some cases.

1. **Logic for Finding Bets**:
   - The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers (`m`).
   - Then, it calculates the value of each bet as `m / k[i]` and divides it by the GCD of these values to reduce the size of the numbers.
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the reduced LCM. If not, it returns `-1`.

2. **Issue with the Condition**:
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is not correct. The sum of the bets (`sum(c)`) should be strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario, which is `k[i] * c[i]` for each outcome.
   - The code does not ensure that `sum(c) < k[i] * c[i]` for all `i`.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     2 2 2
     ```
   - The LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
   - The bets calculated will be `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 / 2 = 1` for each `k[i]`).
   - The sum of the bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any winning outcome. Hence, this should return `-1`, but the code will output `1 1 1`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would be to assign bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the minimum `k[i] * x_i` for any `i`.
   - One simple way to do this is to assign bets as `x_i = 1` for all `i` and check if `n < min(k_i)`. If true, print `1 1 ... 1`; otherwise, print `-1`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
