#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and `numbers` has at least `t + 1` elements; `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `numbers[1:]`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers[1:]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. The subsequent elements are integers representing multipliers for each test case. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these multiplier integers.
