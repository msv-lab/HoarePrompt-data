You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and `numbers` has at least `t + 1` elements; `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `numbers[1:]`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers[1:]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing multipliers. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers[1:]`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
