To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the existing variables. The code snippet is:

```python
hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
```

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and `numbers` has at least `t + 1` elements.
- `hcf` is assigned the value of `t`.

The `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In this case, it computes the gcd of `hcf` and `num`. Since the initial value of `hcf` is `t` and `num` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume `num` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and holds some integer value.

After executing `hcf = gcd(hcf, num)`, the value of `hcf` will be updated to the greatest common divisor of its current value (`t`) and `num`.

Since the exact value of `num` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `hcf` as `gcd(t, num)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and `numbers` has at least `t + 1` elements; `hcf` is `gcd(t, num)`**.
