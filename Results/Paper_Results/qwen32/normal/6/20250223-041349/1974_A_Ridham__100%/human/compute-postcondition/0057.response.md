Given the initial state, the `result` list contains the outcomes of processing all `n` test cases. The `print` statement is designed to join each element of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Each element of the `result` list is first converted to a string using the `map(str, result)` function.

Since the exact contents of the `result` list are not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical or string values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, we know that the print statement will output each element of the `result` list on a new line.

Output: **Each element of the `result` list, each on a new line (where `result` is the list containing the outcomes of processing all `n` test cases)**
