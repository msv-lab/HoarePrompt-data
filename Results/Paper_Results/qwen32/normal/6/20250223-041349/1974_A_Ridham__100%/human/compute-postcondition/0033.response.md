The code snippet appends `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list. This means that the `result` list, which initially contained one element (either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`), will now have two elements, both of which are `screen_require_for_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the values `[screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
