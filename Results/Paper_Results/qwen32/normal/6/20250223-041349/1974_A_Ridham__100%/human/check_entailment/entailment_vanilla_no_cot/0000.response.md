Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases. The main issue is in how it handles the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Cells**:
   - After placing 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells incorrectly and does not account for the most efficient way to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` is incorrect because it assumes that all remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons without considering the layout constraints of the 2x2 icons.

2. **Inefficient Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons around the 2x2 icons. It simply checks if the remaining cells are enough but does not account for the actual layout of the grid.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the most efficient way to place the 2x2 icons first and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = y // 2
        if y % 2 != 0:
            screens_for_2x2 += 1
        
        # Calculate remaining 1x1 icon spaces after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_1x1 = x
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        
        if remaining_1x1 > remaining_cells:
            # If remaining 1x1 icons do not fit, calculate additional screens needed
            additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            screens_for_2x2 += additional_screens
        
        result.append(screens_for_2x2)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we place the 2x2 icons first and then efficiently place the remaining 1x1 icons, considering the layout constraints of the grid.
