The code snippet calculates the `extra_space` by subtracting `remaining_cells` from `space_x`. Here are the updated values of the variables after the code execution:

- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.

Since the initial state specifies that `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` will be a positive integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`. `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**
