Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively; `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions on `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
