Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of screens required for a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and whether it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the values of `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) for each test case.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which correctly represents the space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which correctly represents the space required for 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y` is calculated to determine the minimum number of screens required to fit the 2x2 icons. This is done by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up if necessary. This part of the logic seems correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so every two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as the total number of cells in the screens allocated for 2x2 icons minus the cells occupied by 2x2 icons. This is intended to determine how many cells are left for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

5. **Calculating Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program checks if the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons. If they can, the result is the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
   - If not, the program calculates the extra space needed for the 1x1 icons and determines how many additional screens are required to fit these icons. This is done by dividing the extra space by 15 and rounding up if necessary.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

Given the above steps, the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic appears to be sound, and the provided examples in the problem statement match the expected output of the program.

Correctness: **True**
