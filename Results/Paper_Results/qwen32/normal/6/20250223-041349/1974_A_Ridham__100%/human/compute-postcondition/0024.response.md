In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. This means that the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in any calculations or conditions within the loop. The loop will execute `n` times, and the value of `_` is not relevant to the state of the program.

Given that the loop variable `_` is not used, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration does not need to change with respect to `_`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and since it is not used, we do not need to modify any state related to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the decrement in the loop counter which is implicitly handled by the loop construct itself.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
