### Reasoning:
The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pq` is a min-heap of tuples `(price, index)` from the `prices` list. This allows us to efficiently get the day with the lowest price.
   - `total_cost` keeps track of the accumulated cost of buying tickets.
   - `tickets_bought` counts the number of tickets purchased so far.
   - `price_increase` is the cumulative number of tickets bought, which is added to the price of subsequent tickets.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, the day with the lowest price (considering the `price_increase`) is selected.
   - The number of tickets to buy on that day is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost for these tickets is added to `total_cost`.
   - `tickets_bought` is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets purchased, affecting the prices of subsequent days.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
   - The function returns `total_cost`, which is the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

### Correctness:
The algorithm ensures that tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner by always selecting the day with the lowest current price. The use of a priority queue allows efficient retrieval of the day with the lowest price, and the logic correctly accounts for the price increase due to tickets bought on previous days.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
