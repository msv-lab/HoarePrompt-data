The code snippet provided updates the `price_increase` variable by adding the value of `tickets_to_buy` to it. No other variables are modified by the given code.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9.
- `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`.
- `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element.
- `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - min(m, k))`.
- `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`.
- `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`.
- `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list.
- `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.

The only change made by the code snippet is to increment `price_increase` by `tickets_to_buy`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - min(m, k))`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**.
