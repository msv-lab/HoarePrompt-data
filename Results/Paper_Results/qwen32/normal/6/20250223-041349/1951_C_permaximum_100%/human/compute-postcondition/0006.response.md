The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest element from the heap `pq` and assigns it to the variables `price` and `day`. This means that `price` will be the smallest price from the heap, and `day` will be the corresponding index from the `prices` list. The heap `pq` will have one less element after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0; `price_increase` is 0; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list.**
