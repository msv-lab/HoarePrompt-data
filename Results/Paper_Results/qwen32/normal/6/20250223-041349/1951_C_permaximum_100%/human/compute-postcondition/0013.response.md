The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest element from the heap `pq`, which is a tuple containing the smallest `price` and its corresponding `day` (index). This operation updates the `price` and `day` variables with the values of the smallest element from the heap.

After this operation, `pq` will have one less element since the smallest element has been removed. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`; `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`.** 

In simpler terms, `price` and `day` are updated to the smallest price and its corresponding index from the heap `pq`, and `pq` now has one less element. All other variables retain their previous values.
