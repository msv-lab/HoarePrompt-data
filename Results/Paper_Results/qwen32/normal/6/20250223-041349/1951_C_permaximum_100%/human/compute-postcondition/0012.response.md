The loop condition is `while tickets_bought < k:`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9)`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be incremented such that it is still less than `k`. Given that `tickets_bought` is set to `min(m, k)` at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`.

Since `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`, the only way to ensure `tickets_bought < k` is to adjust `k` to be greater than `tickets_bought`. However, since `tickets_bought` is already `min(m, k)`, the simplest and most direct adjustment is to ensure that `k` is strictly greater than `tickets_bought`.

Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to be greater than `tickets_bought`. Since `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`, we can simply state that `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`; `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`**
