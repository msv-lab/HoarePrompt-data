Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`; `a` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `b` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `f` is 1; `m` is `k // 2`; `n` is `k // 2`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged. The values of `m` and `n` are both updated to be equal to `k // 2`.
