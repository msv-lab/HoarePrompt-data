Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`; `a` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `b` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `f` is `1`; `m` is `k // 2`; `n` is `k // 2`.**

In this output state, the values of `m` and `n` have both been updated to `k // 2`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
