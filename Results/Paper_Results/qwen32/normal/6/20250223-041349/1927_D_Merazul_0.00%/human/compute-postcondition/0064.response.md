Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `k` must be at least 1; `a` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `b` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `f` is `1`; `m` is `k // 2`; `n` is `k // 2`; `u` is `True` if `i` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`.**

This means that the variable `u` has been added to the state, and its value depends on whether `i` is an element of the set `a`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
