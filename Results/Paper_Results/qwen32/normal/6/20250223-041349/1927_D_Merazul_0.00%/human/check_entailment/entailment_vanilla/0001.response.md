Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within a specified range `[l, r]` such that the elements at these indices are different (`a_i â‰  a_j`). If no such pair exists, we need to report that by outputting `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses a lambda function `R` to read integers from input and splits them into a map.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - It then reads the array length `n` and the array `a` correctly.
   - However, the program then reads `k` (which is actually the number of queries `q`) and attempts to read the queries into sets `a` and `b`. This is incorrect because the queries are pairs of integers `[l, r]`, not individual integers.

2. **Logic for Queries:**
   - The program initializes `f`, `m`, and `n` and iterates from `1` to `k`. The logic inside the loop seems to be trying to determine something about the presence of elements in sets `a` and `b`, but it does not relate to the problem of finding different elements in a specified range.
   - The print statement at the end attempts to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on some logic, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement of outputting indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program attempts to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on some condition, which does not match the problem's requirement to output indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- For each test case, read the array and the number of queries.
- For each query, extract the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- Check if there are two different elements in this subarray.
- If such elements exist, output their indices. If not, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly parse the input, does not implement the required logic to solve the problem, and does not produce the correct output format.

Correctness: **False**
