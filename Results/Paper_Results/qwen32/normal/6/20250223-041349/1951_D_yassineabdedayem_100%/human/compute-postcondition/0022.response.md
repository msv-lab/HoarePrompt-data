The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes conditions related to the integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is not dependent on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes three integers: `n`, `k`, and `t`.
2. The conditions provided are:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k` (this is a tautology and doesn't change the value of `n`).
   - Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.
3. The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the conditions and variables described, it will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
