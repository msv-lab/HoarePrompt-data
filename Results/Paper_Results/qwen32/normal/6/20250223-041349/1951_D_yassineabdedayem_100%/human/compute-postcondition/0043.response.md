Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then determines if it's possible to partition `n` into `k` parts under certain conditions and prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and their sizes if possible, or "NO" if not.**
