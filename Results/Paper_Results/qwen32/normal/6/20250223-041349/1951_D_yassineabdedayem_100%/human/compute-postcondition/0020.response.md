The `print(1)` statement in the provided Python code snippet will execute and print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Let's break down the initial state and the code:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- There are conditions based on the values of `n` and `k`, but none of these conditions affect the `print(1)` statement. The conditions are:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k` (which is redundant and doesn't change anything).
  - Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition.
  - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

Regardless of which of these conditions is true, the `print(1)` statement will still execute and print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
