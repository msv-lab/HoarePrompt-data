The given code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state describes the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the integer `1`.

Since there are no conditions or variables affecting the `print` statement itself, the output will always be `1` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Output: **1**
