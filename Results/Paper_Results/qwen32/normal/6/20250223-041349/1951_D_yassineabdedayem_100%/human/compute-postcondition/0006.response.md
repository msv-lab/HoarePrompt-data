The given initial state describes the values and relationships of the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. Specifically, it states that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is a positive integer, and `n` is equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`, which does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
