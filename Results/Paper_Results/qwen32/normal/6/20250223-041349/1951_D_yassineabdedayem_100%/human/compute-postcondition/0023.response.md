The given initial state describes the conditions and relationships between the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print(2)`. This statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t` in any way. It will always print the integer `2`.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `t` is a positive integer (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - There are conditions based on the values of `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(2)` is executed.
   - This statement will always output the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
