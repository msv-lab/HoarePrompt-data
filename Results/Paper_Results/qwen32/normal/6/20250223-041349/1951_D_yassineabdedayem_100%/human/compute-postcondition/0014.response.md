The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, `t`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers.
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, the output is straightforward and does not require any additional calculations or descriptions of the variables.

Output: **NO**
