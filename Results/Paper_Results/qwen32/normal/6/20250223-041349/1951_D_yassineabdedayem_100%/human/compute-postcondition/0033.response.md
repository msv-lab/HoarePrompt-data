The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet does not depend on the variables `n`, `k`, or `t` as defined in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement explicitly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
