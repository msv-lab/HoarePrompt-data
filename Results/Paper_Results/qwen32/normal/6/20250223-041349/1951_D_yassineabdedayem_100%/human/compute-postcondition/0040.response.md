Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. If `n` equals `k`, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and if `n + 2 > k * 2`, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged.** 

To simplify, the postcondition can be described as:
Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged regardless of whether `n` equals `k` or not. Additionally, if `n + 2 > k * 2` when `n` does not equal `k`, the relationship between `n` and `k` remains unchanged.**
