The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`.

Here is the analysis based on the provided initial state:

- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is mentioned but does not affect the print statement.

The `print(2)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`. It simply outputs the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
