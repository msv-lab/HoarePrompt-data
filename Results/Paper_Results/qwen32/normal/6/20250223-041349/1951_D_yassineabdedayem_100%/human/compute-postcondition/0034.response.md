The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer, but these variables are not used in the given print statement. Therefore, the value of the print statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The code snippet is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the print statement.
3. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the print statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
