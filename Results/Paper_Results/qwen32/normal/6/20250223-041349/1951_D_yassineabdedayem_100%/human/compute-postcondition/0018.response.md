The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are now updated based on the input, but the value of `t` remains unchanged. The conditions related to `n` and `k` are not affected by this input operation, so they still hold true based on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k`. Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
