To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y - z)` statement, let's break down the variables and their meanings based on the provided initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `a` is an integer value provided by the user input. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `s` is a new input string provided by the user.
- `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

The print statement calculates the value of `x + y - z`. This means we need to count the non-overlapping occurrences of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string `s`, and then compute the result of the expression `x + y - z`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the string s, y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the string s, and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the string s)**
