Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the integer value provided by the user input; `s` is the new input string provided by the user; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`. The value of `y` is updated to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`.**

In simple terms: The value of `y` is now the count of how many times 'pie' appears in the string `s` without overlapping. All other variables remain unchanged.
