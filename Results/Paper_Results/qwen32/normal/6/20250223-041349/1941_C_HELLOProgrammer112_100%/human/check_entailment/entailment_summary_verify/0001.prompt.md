You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie'. It then prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided solution seems to be attempting to count occurrences of "map" and "pie" and then adjust for any overlap of "mapie". However, this approach is flawed.

Here's why:
1. The solution does not consider all possible overlaps between "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mpieap", the occurrences of "map" and "pie" overlap, but the solution does not account for this correctly.
2. Simply counting occurrences and subtracting overlaps does not give the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mpieap", removing the second 'p' would make the string beautiful, but the solution would output 2 (one for "map" and one for "pie"), which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Given the flaws in the provided solution, it is incorrect.
