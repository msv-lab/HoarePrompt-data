The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie'. It then prints the result for each test case.
