To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the initial state provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
2. `a` is an input integer. This variable also does not affect the print statement directly.
3. `s` is an input string. The occurrences of substrings in `s` are what we need to count.
4. `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
5. `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
6. `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

Given the print statement `print(x + y - z)`, we need to compute the value of `x + y - z` based on the occurrences of the substrings in `s`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `x` counts how many times 'map' appears in `s` without overlapping.
- `y` counts how many times 'pie' appears in `s` without overlapping.
- `z` counts how many times 'mapie' appears in `s` without overlapping.

The expression `x + y - z` adjusts for the overlap of 'mapie' by subtracting the count of 'mapie' from the sum of 'map' and 'pie'. This is because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie' as substrings, and if we simply added `x` and `y`, we would be double-counting the occurrences of 'mapie'.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in s, and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in s)**
