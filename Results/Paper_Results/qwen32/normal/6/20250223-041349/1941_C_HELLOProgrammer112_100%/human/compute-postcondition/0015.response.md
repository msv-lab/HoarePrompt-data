The code snippet `a = int(input())` updates the value of `a` by assigning it the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `z`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`, `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`, `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**.
