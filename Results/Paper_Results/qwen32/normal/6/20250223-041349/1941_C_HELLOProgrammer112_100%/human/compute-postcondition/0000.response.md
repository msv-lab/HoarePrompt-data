In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases, `t`. The variables `n` and `s` are defined within the loop body and do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value for `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
