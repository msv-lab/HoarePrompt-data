The code appends the sum of the last element of `left` and `i` to the `left` list. 

Given that `left` was initially `[0, i, 2*i]`, the last element of `left` is `2*i`. Therefore, the new element appended to `left` will be `2*i + i`, which is `3*i`.

Thus, the updated `left` list will be `[0, i, 2*i, 3*i]`.

The values of other variables (`a`, `n`, `ans`, `last`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is `[0, i, 2*i, 3*i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
