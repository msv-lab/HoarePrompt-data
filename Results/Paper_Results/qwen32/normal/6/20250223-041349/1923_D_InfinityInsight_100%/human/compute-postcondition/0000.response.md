The code snippet initializes a list `left` with a single element, `0`. The initial state of the variables `a` and `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`.**
