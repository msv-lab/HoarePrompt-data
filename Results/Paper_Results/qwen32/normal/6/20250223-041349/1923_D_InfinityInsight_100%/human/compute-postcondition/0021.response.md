The code snippet appends a new element to the list `left`. This new element is the sum of the last element of `left` and `i`, where `i` is the next element in the list `a`. 

The initial state of `left` is `[0, i]`, where `i` is the next element in `a`. After the code execution, `left` will have an additional element which is `left[-1] + i`, i.e., `i + i` or `2*i`.

Given that `left` was `[0, i]`, the new `left` will be `[0, i, 2*i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is `[0, i, 2*i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.**
