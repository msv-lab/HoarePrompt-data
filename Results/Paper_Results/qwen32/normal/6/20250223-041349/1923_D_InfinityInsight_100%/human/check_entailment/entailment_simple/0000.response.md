### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and flow of the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Function `func_1(a, x)`:
- This function is supposed to find the smallest index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`.
- It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in `a`. If the element at that position is exactly `x`, it returns the index plus one. Otherwise, it returns the insertion point.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is less than the smallest element in `a` by returning `-1`.

#### Function `func_2(a, n)`:
- This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from the left.
- It maintains a `left` list that contains cumulative sums of slime sizes up to each slime.
- It also maintains a `last` list to keep track of the last index where the slime size changed.
- For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous slime, it can be eaten in one second.
- Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the current slime minus the current slime size minus one. It then finds the smallest index in the `left` list that is greater than or equal to this value using `func_1`. If the last size change index is smaller than this index, it uses the last size change index instead.
- If the found index is valid, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten.

#### Main Loop:
- The main loop processes each test case.
- It calls `func_2` on the original list and the reversed list to get the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from both directions.
- It then takes the minimum of these two values for each slime. If either direction results in `-1` (impossible to be eaten), it takes the maximum of the two values.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by considering both left and right directions.
- The use of cumulative sums and binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the upper limits of the problem constraints.

The given program correctly solves the problem based on the provided logic and constraints.
