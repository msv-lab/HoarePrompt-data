You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    #The program returns the value of `ans` which is modified based on the loop conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) indicates a specific value based on the conditions applied to the elements of `a`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The main function `func_2` aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or determine if it is impossible. However, the logic in the code seems flawed and does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Let's analyze a specific case where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

According to the problem statement, the process would go as follows:
- The 2nd slime cannot eat the 1st slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 3rd slime cannot eat the 2nd slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 4th slime cannot eat the 3rd slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 5th slime cannot eat the 4th slime because it is not strictly bigger.

Since no slime can eat another slime, the output should be:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

However, the provided code will not produce this output. The code attempts to use a prefix sum and binary search approach to determine the minimum number of seconds, but it does not correctly simulate the process where each slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly bigger. The code seems to be trying to find some prefix sum condition, which is not directly related to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement, and it fails to handle at least one potential case.
