The code snippet `inx = inx2` updates the value of `inx` to be the same as `inx2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx2` is less than `inx` (before the assignment, now `inx` is equal to `inx2`).**
