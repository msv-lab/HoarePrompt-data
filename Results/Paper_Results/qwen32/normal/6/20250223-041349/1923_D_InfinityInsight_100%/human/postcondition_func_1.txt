The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) indicates a specific value based on the conditions applied to the elements of `a`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
