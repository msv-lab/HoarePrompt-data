The provided Python code snippet appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Given the initial state, the list `last` is initialized based on the condition `if a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1]` or `if a[i] is equal to a[i - 1]`. 

Let's consider both scenarios:

1. **If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`**: 
   - Initial `last` is `[-1, i, i]`.
   - After `last.append(last[-1])`, `last` becomes `[-1, i, i, i]`.

2. **If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`**: 
   - Initial `last` is `[-1, -1, i]`.
   - After `last.append(last[-1])`, `last` becomes `[-1, -1, i, i]`.

Since the specific values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact initial state of `last`. However, we know that the last element of `last` is appended to `last` in both cases.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i, i, i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, -1, i, i]`.**
