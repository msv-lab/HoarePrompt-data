Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1`, `last` is unchanged, and `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or conditions changed, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
