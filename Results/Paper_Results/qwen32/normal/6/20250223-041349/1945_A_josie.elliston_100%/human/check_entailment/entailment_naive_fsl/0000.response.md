Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it handles all the edge cases correctly according to the problem description.

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`: This function attempts to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
2. `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`: This function uses `func_1` to calculate the total number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's not possible.

Let's break down the logic:

- `func_1` checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remainder of extroverts plus universals can form a group of 3. If not, it returns `None`.
- `func_2` calls `func_1` and if `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
1. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough universals to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts.
2. The function `func_1` does not consider the possibility of forming smaller groups with universals if the extroverts cannot be perfectly divided into groups of 3.

Let's consider an example case:
- Suppose we have `a = 0`, `b = 2`, and `c = 1`.
  - According to the problem description, we need 1 tent for the two extroverts and the one universal (since 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form a group of 3).
  - However, `func_1` will return `None` because `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 1 < 3` is `True`. This will result in `func_2` returning `-1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the provided code does not handle all cases correctly, and we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
