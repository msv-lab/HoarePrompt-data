Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert must be in a tent alone. Thus, the number of tents required for introverts is exactly `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. Thus, the number of tents required for extroverts must be `ceil(b / 3)`, as each tent can accommodate 3 people, one of whom is an extrovert.

3. **Universals (c):** Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others. They can be used to fill in the gaps left by introverts and extroverts.

4. **Constraints:** If it is impossible to fulfill the wishes of each participant, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:**
  - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and any additional universals needed to fill the gaps.
  - The function checks if the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero. If so, it checks if the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3, which would mean it's impossible to form a group of 3 for the remaining extroverts. In this case, it returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and the remaining universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:**
  - This function uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and any additional universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to the rules, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

### Correctness:

Let's verify if the program handles all the cases correctly:

1. **Handling Introverts:**
   - The program correctly adds the number of introverts (`a`) to the total number of tents.

2. **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the remaining extroverts can be grouped with universals to form tents of 3.
   - If not, it returns `None`, which is correctly handled by `func_2` to return `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`), returning `0` tents.
   - It also correctly handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate all participants, returning `-1`.

### Verification with Function Summaries:

The function summary for `func_2` states:
- The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- It returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of that computation.

This aligns with the problem description and the program's logic.

### Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case: `1 2 3`**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Test Case: `1 4 1`**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case: `19 7 18`**
   - Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
   - Tents for introverts: 19
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = ceil(25 / 3) = 9`
   - Total tents: `19 + 9 = 28`
   - Output: `28` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the constraints are respected.

**Final: True**
