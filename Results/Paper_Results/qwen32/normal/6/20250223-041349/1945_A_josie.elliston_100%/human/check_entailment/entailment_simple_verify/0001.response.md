### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure that the program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert must occupy a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. Thus, the number of tents required for extroverts is `ceil(b / 3)`.
3. **Universals (c):** Universals can be used to fill in the gaps left by introverts and extroverts.
4. **Constraints:** If it's impossible to fulfill the wishes of each participant, the output should be `-1`.

#### Program Analysis Recap:
- **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:**
  - Checks if the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero.
  - If so, it checks if the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3. If true, it returns `None` (impossible to form a group of 3).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and any additional universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:**
  - Uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and any additional universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (impossible to accommodate).
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

#### Annotations:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Correctly checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, returning `None` if true.
  - Otherwise, it calculates `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Correctly handles the result from `func_1`, returning `-1` if `None` and otherwise adding `introverts` to the result from `func_1`.

#### Verification of Edge Cases:
- **No Participants (`a = b = c = 0`)**: The program correctly returns `0` tents.
- **Impossible Cases**: The program correctly returns `-1` when it's impossible to form groups of 3 for extroverts with the available universals.

#### Conclusion:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The program handles all edge cases and ensures that the constraints are respected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
