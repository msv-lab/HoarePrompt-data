Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and if `hd` was greater than 0, it is now `hd - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is incremented by 1. If `hd` was not greater than 0, no changes are made to `hd`.**
