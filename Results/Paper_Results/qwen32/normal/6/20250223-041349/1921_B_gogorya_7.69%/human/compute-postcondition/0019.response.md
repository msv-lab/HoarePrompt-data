The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and no loop is shown, the `continue` statement has no impact on the variables or the state provided.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `i` is 4; `hd` is `hd - 1`**
