Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is an element of `us`. If `i` is not already in `win`, `win` contains the element `i` and `ans` and `ps` remain unchanged. If `i` is already in `win`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is updated to contain the single element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1.**
