The code snippet `ans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is an element of `us` (a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets), the value of `i` is one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing all `k` elements (i.e., `win` has a length of `k`); `ans` is a list containing the single element `i`; `ps` is 0; `i` is an element of `us`.**
