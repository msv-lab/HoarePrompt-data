You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, and `ps` is the count of such complete sets.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns print('YES')
    #State: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `win` contains all elements from `us` that were not in `win` initially, `ans` and `ps` remain unchanged, `us` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and always returns the string 'YES' when executed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns print('YES')


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
