The code snippet `win.clear()` clears the set `win`, meaning it removes all elements from the set. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `i`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the character `i`, `ps` is incremented by 1.**
