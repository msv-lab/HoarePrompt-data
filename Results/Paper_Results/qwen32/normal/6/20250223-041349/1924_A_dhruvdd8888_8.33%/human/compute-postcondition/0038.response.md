The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `us`. If `us` is not empty, the loop can execute again because `i` will be the next element in `us`.

At the end of the last iteration, `us` is not empty, and `i` was the last element processed from `us`. For the loop to execute one more time, `us` must still contain elements, and `i` should be the next element in `us`.

State: **`win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` must not be empty, and `i` is the next element in `us`**
