The code snippet `ps += 1` increments the value of the variable `ps` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change in the state is the increment of `ps`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `win` is a set containing the character `i`, `ans` is a list containing the character `i`, `ps` is incremented by 1.**
