Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element. If `new_segment` was non-empty, `new_segment[0]` is the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]` before `arr[i]` was added, `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`; otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[[new_segment[0], new_segment[1], i - 1]]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]` and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` was empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is now `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. `max_sum` remains -1 in both cases.**
