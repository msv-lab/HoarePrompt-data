Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `max_sum` remains -1; `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it; `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`.**

In simple terms: The list `arr` still contains integers with at least one element. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The variable `max_sum` remains -1. The list `segments_variants` includes a new segment `new_segment` with an extra element `i - 1`. The variable `max_segment` is now directly equal to `new_segment`.
