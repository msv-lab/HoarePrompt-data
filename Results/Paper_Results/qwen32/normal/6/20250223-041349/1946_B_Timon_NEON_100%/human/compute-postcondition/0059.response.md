Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, `total_max_segment` is `[3, 3, 4]`, `segment` is `[3, 3, 4]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `segment`, which is `[3, 3, 4]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
