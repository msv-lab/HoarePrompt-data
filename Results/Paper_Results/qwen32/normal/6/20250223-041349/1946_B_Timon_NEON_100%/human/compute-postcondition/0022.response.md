Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` remains an empty list, and `max_sum` remains -1.**
