The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the combination of `new_segment` and a list containing `i - 1`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged except for the modification to `segments_variants`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**
