Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list where `new_segment[0]` is the previous value of `new_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `new_segment[0]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
