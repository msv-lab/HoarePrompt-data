The code modifies the first element of the `max_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment` has its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` remains the same, `new_segment` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms: The first element of `max_segment` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it. All other variables retain their original values.
