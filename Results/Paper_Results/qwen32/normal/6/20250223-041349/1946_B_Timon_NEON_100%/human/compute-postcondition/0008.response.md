The code appends a new list to `segments_variants` by concatenating `max_segment` with `[i - 1]`. This means that `segments_variants` will now contain the list `[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]` as its first (and currently only) element.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and the current element of `arr` at index `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`, `max_sum` is -1, the current element of `arr` at index `i` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.**
