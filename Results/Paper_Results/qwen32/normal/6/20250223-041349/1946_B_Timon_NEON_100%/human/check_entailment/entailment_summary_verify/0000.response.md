### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its functions in the context of the problem description and the provided function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Function Summary**: Returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Analysis**: This function seems correct as it ensures that the final answer is within the required range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Function Summary**: Attempts to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices.
   - **Analysis**:
     - The function is designed to find the maximum sum subarray, but its implementation is flawed.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is not robust, particularly in handling cases where all numbers are negative or when the subarray transitions from positive to negative values.
     - The function does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the array contains only negative numbers or when the maximum subarray is at the beginning or end of the array.
     - The function does not ensure that the maximum subarray sum is correctly identified in all scenarios.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Function Summary**: Incomplete and does not perform any operations.
   - **Analysis**:
     - The function is described as incomplete and does not perform any operations to insert the sum of subarrays into the original array.
     - The function is supposed to handle the main logic of performing `k` operations and calculating the final sum, but it is not implemented.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Implementation**: The program does not perform any operations to insert the sum of subarrays into the original array.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum is incomplete and may not work correctly for all edge cases.
- **Lack of Iteration**: The program does not iterate over the number of operations `k` to perform the required insertions.
- **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum of the array after `k` operations is not calculated.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The program should output `96` as explained in the problem description. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly because it does not perform any insertions based on the maximum subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
