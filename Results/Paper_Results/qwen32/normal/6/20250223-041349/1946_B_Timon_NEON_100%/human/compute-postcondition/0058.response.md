Postcondition: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, `segment` is `[3, 3, 4]`. The current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not equal to 1.**
