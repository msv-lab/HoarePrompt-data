### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This seems to be useful for ensuring that the final answer is within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray in the given array `arr`.
   - It iterates through the array to keep track of the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The function returns the subarray with the maximum sum.
   - However, there are some issues with the logic:
     - `max_segment` and `new_segment` are initialized incorrectly. They should be initialized with the sum and the index of the first non-negative element, not just the sum.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. The function does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum subarray ends at the last element of the array.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements are negative.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**
   - This function is supposed to compute the final answer, but it is incomplete and does not perform any operations.
   - The logic for performing the k operations and calculating the maximum possible sum is missing.

#### Conclusion:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. 
- `func_2` has incorrect logic for finding the maximum sum subarray.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem.
- The program does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum after k operations.
