Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.**

Natural Language: The variable `new_segment` is now assigned the value `[arr[i], i]`, where `arr[i]` is the current element of the list `arr` and `i` is its index. All other variables remain unchanged.
