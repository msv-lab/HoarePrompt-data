Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
