Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, and if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new list appended to it, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are simply incremented by `arr[i]`.**
