Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element. If `new_segment` was non-empty, `new_segment[0]` is the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]` before `arr[i]` was added, `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`; otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[[new_segment[0], new_segment[1], i - 1]]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]` and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` was empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is now `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. `max_sum` remains -1 in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `new_segment` was not an empty list before the if statement, it is now an empty list. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are each increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0 and `new_segment` was not empty, `new_segment` is not defined. `segments_variants` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is True, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are incremented by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, a new list `max_segment + [i - 1]` is appended to `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`. If `new_segment` is False, `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`, and if `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
