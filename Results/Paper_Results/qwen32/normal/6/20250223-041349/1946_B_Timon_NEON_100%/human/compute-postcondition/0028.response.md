The code snippet assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This does not affect the other variables directly, but it updates the value of `max_segment` to match `new_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_segment` is `new_segment`.**
