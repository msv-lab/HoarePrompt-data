To determine what will be printed when the `print(x)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`**: This is an integer representing the number of test cases. It is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **`a` and `b`**: These are integers obtained from the new input.
3. **`c` and `d`**: These are integers obtained from the most recent input.
4. **`e` and `f`**: These are integers obtained from the current input.
5. **`n`**: This is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
6. **`x`**: This is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
7. **`g` and `h`**: These are integers obtained from the new input.
8. **`steps`**: This is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.

### Calculation of `x`
The value of `x` is determined by the formula:
\[ x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h) \]

### Given Information
- The exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are not provided.
- Therefore, we can only describe `x` in terms of these variables.

### Output
The `print(x)` statement will output the value of `x`, which is the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((c, d)\) and \((g, h)\).

### Final Answer
Output: **x (where x is the squared Euclidean distance between the points (c, d) and (g, h))**
