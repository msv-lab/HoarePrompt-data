Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
- It is given that \(x \leq n\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet directly prints the value of `x`.
- `x` is calculated based on the formula \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
- The exact numerical value of `x` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `c`, `g`, `d`, and `h`. However, we know the formula used to compute `x`.

### Output:
The `print(x)` statement will output the value of `x`, which is calculated using the formula \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

Output: **x (where x is the value calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\))**
