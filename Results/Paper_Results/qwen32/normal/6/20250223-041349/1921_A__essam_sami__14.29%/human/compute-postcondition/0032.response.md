Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the new input; `c` and `d` are integers obtained from the most recent input; `e` and `f` are integers obtained from the current input; `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\); `x` is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\); `g` and `h` are integers obtained from the new input; `steps` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. The comparison `x > n` is performed, but the postcondition does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `n`, `x`, `g`, `h`, or `steps` based on the result of the comparison.**
