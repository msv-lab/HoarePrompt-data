The code snippet assigns new values to `e` and `f` by reading an input line, splitting it into two parts, and converting each part to an integer. The initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100); `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `c` and `d` are integers obtained from the input; `e` and `f` are integers obtained from the input.**
