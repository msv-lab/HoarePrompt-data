You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums` plus 1.
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`. Either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`, which is stored in the variable `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer representing a threshold value), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). The function processes the list `nums` by reducing its elements based on the value of `k`. If all elements in `nums` are reduced to 0 and removed, the function returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed plus 1. In all other cases, it returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed, stored in the variable `ans`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums` plus 1.

Case_2: The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`, which is stored in the variable `ans`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
