The code assigns the variable `x` the minimum value between `a` and `b`. The values of `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `x` takes on the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
