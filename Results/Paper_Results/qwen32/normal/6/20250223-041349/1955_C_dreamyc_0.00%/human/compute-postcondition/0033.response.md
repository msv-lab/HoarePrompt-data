The code snippet appends the value of `b` to the list `nums`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged unless the `break` statement is executed, which is not the case here as we are only considering the execution of `nums.append(b)`. The variable `ans` is only incremented if `a` is not greater than 0, but this condition does not affect the state of `nums` directly.

Given the initial state, the only change is the addition of `b` to the end of the list `nums`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer with `b` appended to it, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the `break` statement is executed. If `a` was not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
