Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `nums` is a deque of `n-1` or `n` integers depending on the value of `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` has `n-1` integers with `a` appended at the beginning. If `b` is greater than 0, `b` is appended at the end of `nums`. `x` is recalculated as min(a, b) after any modifications to `a` and `b`. If `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `a` is 0, `nums` has `n-2` integers, and `ans` is set to 1. If `b` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
