The value of `x` is assigned the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
