The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `x`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the `break` statement is executed. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
