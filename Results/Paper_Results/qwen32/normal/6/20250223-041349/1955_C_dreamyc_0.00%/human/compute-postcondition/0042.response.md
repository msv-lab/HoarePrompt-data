Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
