You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to simulate the Kraken's attacks on a sequence of ships, each with a specific durability. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship in the sequence until it either runs out of attacks or all ships have sunk.

Let's examine the provided program step-by-step to see if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Simulation Logic:**
   - The program uses a `deque` to efficiently access and modify the first and last elements of the list of ships.
   - It initializes `ans` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The main loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships remaining (`len(nums) >= 2`).

3. **Attacking Ships:**
   - In each iteration of the loop, the program removes the first (`a`) and last (`b`) ship from the `deque`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability (`x`) between the two ships.
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink both ships (`k >= 2 * x`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and subtracts `2 * x` from `k`.
   - If the durability of a ship is greater than zero after the attack, it is put back into the `deque`. Otherwise, the ship is considered sunk and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Handling Single Ship:**
   - After the main loop, if there is one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), the program increments `ans` by one.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of ships that have sunk for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- It efficiently reduces the durability of ships and removes them when they sink.
- It correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it.
- The use of a `deque` allows for efficient removal and addition of elements from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
