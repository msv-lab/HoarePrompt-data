Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `nums` is a deque of `n-1` or `n` integers depending on the value of `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` has `n-1` integers with `a` appended at the beginning. If `b` is greater than 0, `b` is appended at the end of `nums`. `x` is recalculated as min(a, b) after any modifications to `a` and `b`. If `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `a` is 0, `nums` has `n-2` integers, and `ans` is set to 1. If `b` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b > 0` and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. If `b > 0` and `k` is less than `2 * x`, the `break` statement is executed. If `b > 0` and `a` was not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` and `b` are the first and last integers removed from `nums` respectively, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` is greater than 0 and `a` is greater than 0 and `k` was initially greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`. If `b` is greater than 0 and either `a` is not greater than 0 or `k` was less than `2 * x`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
