The code snippet removes the first element from the `nums` deque and assigns it to `a`, and removes the last element from the `nums` list and assigns it to `b`. Given that `nums` initially has at least 2 integers, after the operations, `nums` will have at least one integer remaining.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`.**
