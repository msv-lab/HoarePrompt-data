Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the integer that was the first element of `nums` minus `x`; `b` is the integer that was the last element of `nums`; `ans` is 0; `x` is min(a, b); `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`.**

In the output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be `a - x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
