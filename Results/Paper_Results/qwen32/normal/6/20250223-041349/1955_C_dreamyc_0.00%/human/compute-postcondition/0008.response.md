The value of `k` is decremented by `2 * x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` before `b` was modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 minus 2 * x; `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the integer that was the first element of `nums` minus `x`; `b` is `b - x`; `ans` is 0; `x` is min(a, b) before `b` was modified.**
