Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there is an odd number of ships and the number of attacks is large enough to potentially sink all but one ship, but not enough to sink the last remaining ship. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling of Single Ship Case**: The program correctly handles the case when there is only one ship by checking if `len(nums) == 1` and if `k >= nums[0]`. This part seems correct.

2. **Attacking Multiple Ships**: The main logic of the program is to alternate between attacking the first and last ship. The logic for reducing the durability and checking if the ships sink is correct, but it breaks out of the loop when it cannot fully attack both ships in a cycle (i.e., when `k < 2 * x`). This is not incorrect per se, but it does not account for the possibility of attacking the remaining ship(s) after this.

3. **Remaining Attacks After Loop**: After the loop, the program does not correctly account for the remaining attacks. Specifically, if there are still ships left and attacks remaining, it should continue to attack the remaining ships until there are no more ships left or no more attacks left. The current program only checks if there is one ship left and if it can be sunk, but it does not handle the case where there are multiple ships left and enough attacks to sink them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and nums:
        if len(nums) >= 2:
            (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
            x = min(a, b)
            if k >= 2 * x:
                a -= x
                b -= x
                k -= 2 * x
            else:
                x = k // 2
                a -= x
                b -= x
                k = 0
            if a > 0:
                nums.appendleft(a)
            else:
                ans += 1
            if b > 0:
                nums.append(b)
            else:
                ans += 1
        elif len(nums) == 1:
            if k >= nums[0]:
                ans += 1
                k -= nums[0]
                nums.pop()
            else:
                k = 0
    return ans

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program continues to attack the remaining ships after the loop, handling all edge cases correctly.
