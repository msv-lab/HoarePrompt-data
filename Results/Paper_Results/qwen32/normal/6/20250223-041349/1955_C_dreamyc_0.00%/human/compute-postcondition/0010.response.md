Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the integer that was the first element of `nums`; `b` is the integer that was the last element of `nums`; `ans` is 0; `x` is min(a, b); and `k` is less than 2 * `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
