Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums`, respectively, and `ans` is 0. `x` is min(a, b) and `a` is greater than 0. If `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, `b` is reduced by `x`, and `x` is recalculated as min(a, b) before `b` was modified. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
