The code snippet removes the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, but they are now assigned the values of the first and last elements of `nums`. The deque `nums` will have two fewer elements after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the integer that was the first element of `nums`; `b` is the integer that was the last element of `nums`; `ans` is 0.**
