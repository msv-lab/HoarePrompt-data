Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been increased by 1. The values of `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain as described in the initial state, with no further changes to these variables.
