### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - The `nums` list is converted into a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - The first and last ship's durability are retrieved and stored in `a` and `b`.
     - The minimum durability between the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`) is determined.
     - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink both ships (`k >= 2 * x`), both ships' durability is reduced by `x` and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`.
     - If the durability of either ship is still greater than 0 after the attack, it is added back to the `deque` at the appropriate end.
     - If a ship's durability is reduced to 0, it is considered sunk and the count `ans` is incremented.

3. **Handling Single Ship Case**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), the ship is sunk and `ans` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the total number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:
- For the first test case with `n=4`, `k=5`, and `nums=[1, 2, 4, 3]`:
  - The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0 (`nums = [2, 4, 3]`).
  - The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 2 (`nums = [2, 4, 2]`).
  - The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 1 (`nums = [1, 4, 2]`).
  - The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1 (`nums = [1, 4, 1]`).
  - The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0 (`nums = [4, 1]`).
  - Two ships have been sunk, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships sunk as per the problem description. There are no logical errors or edge cases that are not handled.

**Correctness: True**
