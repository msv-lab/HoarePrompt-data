Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 0**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
