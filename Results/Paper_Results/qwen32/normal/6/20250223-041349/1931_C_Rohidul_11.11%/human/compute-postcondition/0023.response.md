The code snippet `end += 1` increments the variable `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` is initially 2. After the increment, `end` becomes 3.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is greater than `l` minus 1; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 3; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.**
