The code snippet sets the values of `l` and `r` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively. This means `l` is updated to `0` and `r` is updated to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element; `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
