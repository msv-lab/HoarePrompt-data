To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition `r > l`:** 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be greater than `l`.

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`:**
   - This condition checks if the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`. For the loop to execute again, these two elements must be equal.

Given the current states:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `r` is `l`.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `end` is 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need to adjust `r` so that `r > l`.
- We need to ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Since `r` is currently equal to `l`, we can increment `r` by 1 to satisfy `r > l`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the element at the new `r` is equal to the element at `r - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l + 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 1; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
