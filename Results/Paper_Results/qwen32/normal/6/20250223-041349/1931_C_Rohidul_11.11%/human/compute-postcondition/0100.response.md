Postcondition: **`r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`. The first element of the array `a` is not equal to the last element of the array `a`. Additionally, either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
