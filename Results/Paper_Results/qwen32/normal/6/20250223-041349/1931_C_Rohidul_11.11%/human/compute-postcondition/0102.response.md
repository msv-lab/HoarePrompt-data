Postcondition: **`r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`; the first element of the array `a` is not equal to the last element of the array `a`. If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
