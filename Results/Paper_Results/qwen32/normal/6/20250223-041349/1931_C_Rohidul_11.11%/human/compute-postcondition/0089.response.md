The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. According to the initial state, `r` is initially set to `n - 2`. After the decrement operation, `r` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input such that the last two elements are equal, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `l` is decremented by 1 (ensuring it remains less than n - 2), `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the number of times the loop has incremented `l`, `end` is 1**.
