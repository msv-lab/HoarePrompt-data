The code snippet increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` was 1, so after the increment, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0**.
