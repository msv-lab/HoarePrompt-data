The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is greater than `l` minus 1; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 2; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
