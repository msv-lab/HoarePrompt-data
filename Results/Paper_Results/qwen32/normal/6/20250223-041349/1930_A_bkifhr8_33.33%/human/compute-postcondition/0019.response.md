The code snippet removes the element at index 2 (which is the third element, as indexing starts at 0) from the list `lst`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `l`, `ans` are not affected by this operation. The list `lst` will have one less element after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings, each representing one of the integers from `l` except for the first and third one, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`.**
