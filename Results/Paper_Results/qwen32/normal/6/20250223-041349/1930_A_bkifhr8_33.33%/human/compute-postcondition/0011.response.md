The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst` (since `1 * 2` evaluates to 2). 

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of `2n-1` strings, each representing one of the integers from `l` (excluding the first element). After the removal, `lst` will have `2n-2` elements, with the element at index 2 removed.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user.**
