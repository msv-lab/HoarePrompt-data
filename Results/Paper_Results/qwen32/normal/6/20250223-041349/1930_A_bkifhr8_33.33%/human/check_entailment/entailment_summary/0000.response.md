Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by reading the input test cases and computing the maximum score that can be achieved by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, there are a few issues in the provided code that prevent it from working correctly:

1. The code attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` always evaluate to 0 and 2, respectively, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list after processing them.

2. The loop that processes the list `lst` is structured incorrectly. It should iterate `n` times, each time selecting the minimum of the first two elements, adding it to the score, and then removing those elements from the list. However, the current loop iterates `2n` times and incorrectly checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, which is not the correct condition for processing pairs.

3. The code correctly handles the case when the list has only two elements left, but the logic for removing elements is flawed.

To fix the program, the loop should be adjusted to iterate `n` times, and the elements should be removed correctly. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
    lst.remove(lst[0])
    lst.remove(lst[0])
```

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly compute the maximum score as intended by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
