Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n-1 strings, each representing one of the integers from `l` except for the first one, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code removes the first element from the list `lst`, so `lst` now contains 2n-1 elements instead of 2n. All other variables remain unchanged.
