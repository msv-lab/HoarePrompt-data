Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2. `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of the integer values represented by the first two elements of `lst`. All other variables retain their initial values.
