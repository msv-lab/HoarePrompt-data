To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `i` is defined as `t - 1`.

Since `i` is explicitly defined as `t - 1`, the value of `i` is directly dependent on the value of `t`. Given that `t` can range from 1 to 5000, `i` will range from \(1 - 1 = 0\) to \(5000 - 1 = 4999\).

However, without an explicit value for `t`, we can only describe `i` in terms of `t`.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `t - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be described as:

Output: **t - 1 (where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000)**
