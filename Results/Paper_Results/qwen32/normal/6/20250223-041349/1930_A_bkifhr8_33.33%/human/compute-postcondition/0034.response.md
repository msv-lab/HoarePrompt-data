Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, and `lst` is a list with fewer than 2 elements, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer input by the user. However, the precondition specifies that `n` is already an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. Therefore, the value of `n` remains the same as the user input, and all other variables retain their initial values.
