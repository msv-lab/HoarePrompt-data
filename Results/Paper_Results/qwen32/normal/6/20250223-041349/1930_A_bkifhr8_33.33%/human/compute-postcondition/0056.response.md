The code removes the element at index 2 (which is `lst[1 * 2]` or `lst[2]`) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state, we know that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a string `l` by spaces, with the first element removed. Therefore, after splitting and removing the first element, `lst` has `2n-1` elements since one element was removed from the original split list.

After the removal of the element at index 2, the list `lst` will have `2n-2` elements.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `l`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed and the third element (index 2) also removed, `ans` is the initial `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` converted to integers.**
