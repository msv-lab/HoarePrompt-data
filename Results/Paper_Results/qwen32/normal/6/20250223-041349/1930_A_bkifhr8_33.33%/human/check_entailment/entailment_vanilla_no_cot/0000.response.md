Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect List Removal Logic**: The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, the program should remove the first two elements of the list after processing them.

2. **Inefficient Min Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum of the first two elements and then removes them, but it does not sort the list first. To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest numbers together. Sorting the list and then summing every second element (starting from the first) would yield the correct result.

3. **Unnecessary Condition**: The `if len(lst) != 2` condition is unnecessary because the loop will naturally handle the case when only two elements remain. The `else` block is redundant.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of numbers and then sums every second element starting from the first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
