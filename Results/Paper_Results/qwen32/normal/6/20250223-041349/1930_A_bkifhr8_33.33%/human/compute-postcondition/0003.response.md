Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
