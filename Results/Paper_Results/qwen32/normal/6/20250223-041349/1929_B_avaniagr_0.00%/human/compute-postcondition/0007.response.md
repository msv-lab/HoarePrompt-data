The code snippet provided splits the string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state mentions that `s` is `s_next`, which implies `s` contains two space-separated integers. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold these integer values.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `s` is `s_next`; `n` and `k` are integers derived from the string `s_next` by splitting and converting.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `s` remains unchanged, `t` still must be at least 1, and `n` and `k` now hold the integer values obtained from splitting `s`.
