To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer provided by user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
2. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Analysis:
- The value of `n` is not directly used in the print statement, so we don't need to consider it for the output.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, but the initial value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of its incremented value.

### Output Description:
- The print statement `print(i)` will output the current value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Final Output:
Since the exact initial value of `i` is not given, we can only describe the output as the incremented value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the incremented value of i from its previous iteration)**
