To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition and the given state.

The `while` loop in question is:
```
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Given the state right before the loop, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50, it will always be non-zero. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute at least once without any need for adjustment.

Thus, the state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
