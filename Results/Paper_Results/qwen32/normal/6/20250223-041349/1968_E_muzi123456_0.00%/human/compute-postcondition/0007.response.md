The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and `i` is the last value it took in the loop, which is `n` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. However, since the loop condition is `i < n + 1`, the loop will not execute if `i` is already `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to the next value it would take in the loop, which is `n + 1` minus the condition check, so `i` should be `n`.

Since `n` is provided by the user and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n**
