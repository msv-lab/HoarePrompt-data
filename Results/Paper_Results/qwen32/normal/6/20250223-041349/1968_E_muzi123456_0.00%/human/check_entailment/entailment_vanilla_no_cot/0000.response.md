Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The current implementation simply prints points along the first row of the grid, which will not result in a large variety of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n=3\), the program will output the points (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3), resulting in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of only \{0, 1, 2\}. However, as shown in the problem description and the example output, it is possible to achieve a larger set \(\mathcal{H}\) by choosing points strategically.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in a way that maximizes the variety of distances between them. One possible strategy is to place points on a diagonal or in a pattern that ensures a wide range of distances. The example outputs provided in the problem statement demonstrate such placements.
