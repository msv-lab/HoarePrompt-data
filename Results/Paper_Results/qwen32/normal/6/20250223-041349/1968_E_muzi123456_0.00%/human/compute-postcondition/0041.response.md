To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior and the final state of the variables involved in the loop.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

Here's what happens in each iteration:
- The loop starts with `i` taking values from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop prints `1` followed by the current value of `i`.

After all iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will have taken all values from `1` to `n` and will have finished its execution.
- The value of `n` will remain unchanged as it is the user input and does not change within the loop.
- The value of `t` is not affected by the loop since it is defined as `t - 1` in the initial state and is not modified within the loop.

Given the loop runs from `1` to `n`, the output state after all iterations will be when `i` has completed its sequence up to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and `i` has completed its iterations, taking all values from 1 to n.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `n` remains the same as the user input, and `i` has gone through all numbers from `1` to `n` as specified in the loop.
