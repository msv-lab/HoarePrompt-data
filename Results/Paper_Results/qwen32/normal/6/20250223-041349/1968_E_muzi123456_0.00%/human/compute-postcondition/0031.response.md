The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```
This line of code reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state mentions that `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, but this line of code will overwrite that value with whatever new input is given.

The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. The initial state of `t` is `t - 1`, which means `t` has already been decremented by 1 from some previous value. The initial state of `i` is `n + 1`, but since `n` is being reassigned, the new value of `i` would be based on this new `n`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n + 1` using the new value of `n`.**
