Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, after the decrement, `t` will be between 0 and 49. The value of `n` and the condition for the test cases remain unchanged.
