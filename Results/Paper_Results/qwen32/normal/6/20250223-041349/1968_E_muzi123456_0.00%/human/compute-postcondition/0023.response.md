To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the information provided about the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned for context).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this means `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value).

However, the initial value of `i` is not provided. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the output will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.

Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. After the increment, the value of `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not given, we can only express the output in terms of the incremented value.

Output: **i_initial + 1 (where i_initial is the initial value of i before it was incremented by 1)**
