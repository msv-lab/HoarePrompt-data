Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

- The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the screen.
- The argument `'1'` is a string literal that will be printed.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that instead of the default newline character (`\n`), a space (`' '`) will be printed at the end of the string.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet.
- Therefore, these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **
