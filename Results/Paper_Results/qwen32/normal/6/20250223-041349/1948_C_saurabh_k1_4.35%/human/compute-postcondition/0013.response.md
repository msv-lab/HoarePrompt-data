In the given task, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`), but they are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
