You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) which is even, followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has determined whether the second last character of the string `b` is `'<'`. If it is, it prints `'No'`; otherwise, it prints `'Yes'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer in their initial state as they have been updated through each iteration, but `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (which is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
