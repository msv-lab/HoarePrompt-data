The given initial state describes several variables and their conditions, but the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The list `a` contains strings, each representing a character from the input.
4. The list `b` contains strings, each representing a character from a new input.
5. The current value of `b[n - 2]` is specified to be `'<'`.

However, none of these variables or their values affect the print statement. The print statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement will always output the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
