### Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description and the annotated states. The program only checks if the second last character of the second row (string `b`) is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No', otherwise it outputs 'Yes'. This is an oversimplification and does not consider the actual movement of the robot based on the arrows in the grid.

The robot's movement is more complex and depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows. The robot starts at (1, 1) and must follow the arrows to determine if it can reach (2, n). The program should simulate the robot's movement through the grid to check if it can reach the target cell.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not accurately determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
