The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `cnt`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`
- `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False
- `ans` is the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in `arr`
- `val` is `arr[0]`
- `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, the value of `ans` will be updated, but all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements; `i` is `n-1`.**
