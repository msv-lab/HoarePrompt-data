Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value for each test case based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.**
