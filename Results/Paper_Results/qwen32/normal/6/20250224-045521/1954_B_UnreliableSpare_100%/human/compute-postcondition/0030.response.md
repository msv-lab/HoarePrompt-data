Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
