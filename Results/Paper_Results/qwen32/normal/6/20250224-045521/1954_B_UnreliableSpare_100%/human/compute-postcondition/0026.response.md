The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 1 if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
