The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is 0, the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `0` is `0`.

Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0; `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`**
