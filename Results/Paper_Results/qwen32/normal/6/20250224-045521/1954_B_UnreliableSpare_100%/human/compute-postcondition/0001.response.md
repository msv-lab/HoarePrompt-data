The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state, `n` is the number of integers that will be in the input, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `arr` will hold the same list of integers that `a` was supposed to hold, as per the problem's definition.

The values of `t`, `n`, and the precondition that `a` is a beautiful array remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of `arr`, which now holds the same values as `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`.**
