Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is False; `i` is 4**

Natural language explanation: The value of `flag` has been explicitly set to False. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
