The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet is independent of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The print statement is hardcoded to output `-1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, `cnt`, or `i`.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 300,000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and `n`.
- `arr` is a copy of the list `a`.
- `flag` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same.
- `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements in `arr`, which is `n` if all elements are the same.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.

Despite the detailed state of the program, the `print` statement is straightforward and outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
