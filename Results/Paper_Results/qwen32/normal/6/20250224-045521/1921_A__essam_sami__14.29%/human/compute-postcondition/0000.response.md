The code snippet provided is only `t = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. After executing this line, `t` will be assigned the specific integer value provided by the input, and it will replace the previous description of `t` being an integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.**
