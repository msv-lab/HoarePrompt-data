Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided as input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` are integers read from input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b` are integers read from input; `c`, `d` are the new integers read from input; `e`, `f` are the integers read from the latest input; `g`, `h` are the new integers read from input; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
