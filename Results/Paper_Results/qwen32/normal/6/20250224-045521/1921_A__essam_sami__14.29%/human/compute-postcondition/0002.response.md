The code snippet takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100, but this value is not used or modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

After the execution of the code, the variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers provided as input. 

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input.**
