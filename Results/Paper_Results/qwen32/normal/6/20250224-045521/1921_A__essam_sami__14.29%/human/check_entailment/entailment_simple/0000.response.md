### Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates. It then calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners and prints the smaller of the two distances, which should be the side length squared of the square.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners but does not ensure that these pairs are actually opposite corners of the square. It simply calculates the squared distance between two pairs and prints the smaller one, which may not necessarily be the side length of the square.

2. **Lack of Verification**: The program does not verify that the four points form a square. It assumes that the input is always a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints, but the program does not explicitly check this.

3. **Inconsistent Logic**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners but does not consider all possible pairs. It should calculate the squared distance between all pairs of corners and determine the correct side length from those distances.

Given the above points, the program may not always produce the correct area if the pairs of corners used for distance calculation are not the correct ones. However, based on the provided example, it seems to be working correctly because the pairs of corners used happen to be opposite corners in the examples provided.

### Correctness:

Despite the potential issues, the program appears to be working correctly for the given examples. However, the program does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the reasons mentioned above. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
