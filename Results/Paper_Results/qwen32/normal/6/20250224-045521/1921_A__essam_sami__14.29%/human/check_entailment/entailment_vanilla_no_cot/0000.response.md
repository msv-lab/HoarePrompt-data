Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two, which is not the correct approach to determine the area of the square.

To find the area of the square, we need to determine the length of one of its sides. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be found by calculating the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        # Extract x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length_x = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        side_length_y = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        # Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, one of these will be the side length
        side_length = max(side_length_x, side_length_y)
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates, and then uses the larger difference to compute the area.
