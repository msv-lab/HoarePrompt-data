The only variable in the loop head is `steps`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `steps` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `steps` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `steps` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` are integers read from input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration.**
