To determine what will be printed by the `print(x)` statement, we need to understand the value of `x` based on the initial state provided.

The initial state gives us the following information:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided as inputs.
- `c` and `d` are the two integers from the first input split by space.
- `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space.
- `g` and `h` are the two integers from the latest input split by space.
- `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
- It is given that `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

The value of `x` is computed based on the formula `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. The exact numerical value of `x` cannot be determined without the specific values of `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h`, but we know how it is calculated.

Given the information above, the `print(x)` statement will output the value of `x` as computed by the formula.

Output: **x (where x is calculated as (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h))**
