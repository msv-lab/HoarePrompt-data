Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided as inputs; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space; `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space; `g` and `h` are the two integers from the latest input split by space; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; and `x` is less than or equal to `n`**
