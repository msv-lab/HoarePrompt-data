Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`.**
