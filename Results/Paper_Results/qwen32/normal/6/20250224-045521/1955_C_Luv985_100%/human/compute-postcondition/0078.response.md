Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` will be the total number of elements that have been fully reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]`.**

In this output state, the variable `r` has been updated to `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
