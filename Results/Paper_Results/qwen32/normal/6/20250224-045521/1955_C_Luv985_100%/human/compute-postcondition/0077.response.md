The variable `l` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` will be the index where no more reductions can be made from the right, `ans` will be the total number of elements that have been fully reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]`.**
