Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `l` is 1 and `r` is at least 1, or `l` is 2 and `r` is at least 2, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 3 if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
