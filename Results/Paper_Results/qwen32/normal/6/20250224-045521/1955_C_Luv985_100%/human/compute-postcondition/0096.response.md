Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. Additionally, `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0.**
