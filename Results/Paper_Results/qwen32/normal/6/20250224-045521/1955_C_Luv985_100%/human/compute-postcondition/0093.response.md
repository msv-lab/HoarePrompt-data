Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2`, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[0]` reduced by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` further reduced by `mi`, `l` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` (before the reduction). Additionally, `a[r]` is 0 if the condition `a[r] == 0` is true.**
