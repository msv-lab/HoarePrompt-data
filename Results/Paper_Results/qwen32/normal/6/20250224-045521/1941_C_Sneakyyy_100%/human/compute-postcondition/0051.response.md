Postcondition: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 9, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 3 or 1 and `i` is either 9 or 5. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 0 and `i` is either 7 or 3.`**
