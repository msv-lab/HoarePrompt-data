The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `i` could be 2, 4, or 6 depending on the original value of the substring `s`.

- If the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `i` was initially 6, and after the increment, `i` becomes 7.
- If the original `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` was initially 2, and after the increment, `i` becomes 3.
- If the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `i` was initially 4, and after the increment, `i` becomes 5.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is also not affected by this increment operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`; If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If the original `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**
