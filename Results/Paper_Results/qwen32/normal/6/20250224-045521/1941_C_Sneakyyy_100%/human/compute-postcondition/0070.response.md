The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, if `ans` was 1, it will now be 2. If `ans` was 0, it will now be 1. The values of `iterations`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1; `n` is an integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4.**
