Postcondition: **iterations is the value obtained from int(input()) and must be at least 1; n is an integer; a is a string with length greater than i + 2; s is the substring of a from index i to i + 3; if the original s was 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6; otherwise, if the original s was not 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 0 and i is 2.**
