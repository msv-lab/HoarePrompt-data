The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 4

The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 4, it will be incremented to 5 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5**
