Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program checks the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" as specified:

- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- For all other cases, it prints "NONE".

The program uses the `map` function to convert the input strings into integers and correctly handles multiple test cases. The execution summary provided matches the program's behavior, confirming that it processes each test case according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
