The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints "STAIR" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints "PEAK" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints "NONE" for all other cases.
