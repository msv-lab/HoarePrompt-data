You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: After `n` iterations, the loop has finished executing. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers read from the input, and `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, and `n` remains the same as well.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true.
2. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if true.
3. **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible combinations of the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (from 0 to 9) for each test case. It also correctly iterates through the number of test cases specified by the user.

The example inputs and outputs provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
