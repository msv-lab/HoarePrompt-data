Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4. The condition `a < b < c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false. The condition `a < b and b > c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false. If `a < b < c` is true, then no additional changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. If `a < b < c` is false and `a < b and b > c` is true, then no additional changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`.**
