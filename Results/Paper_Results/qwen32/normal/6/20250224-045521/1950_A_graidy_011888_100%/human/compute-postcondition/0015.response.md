The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. The statement `print('PEAK')` will output the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the conditions or values of the other variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`, and two conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`, which directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`.
3. Since the print statement is a literal string, it does not depend on the values or conditions of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
