The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t` as described in the initial state. The number `1` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the number `1`.

Output: **1**
