Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an integer input that must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not used in this specific print statement. Therefore, the output will be the constant value `1` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
