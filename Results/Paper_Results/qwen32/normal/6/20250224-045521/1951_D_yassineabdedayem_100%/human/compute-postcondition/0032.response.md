In the given task, we have the following initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
- `t` is an input integer, with the constraint t ≥ 0.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Since the value to be printed is explicitly `1`, and it does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, we can directly state the output.

Output: **1**
