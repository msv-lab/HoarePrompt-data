The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop runs `t` times, and since `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 if the loop body was executed. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has not yet reached 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.**
