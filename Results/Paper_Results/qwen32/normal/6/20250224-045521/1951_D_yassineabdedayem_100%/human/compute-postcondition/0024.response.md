To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.

### Print Statement:
```
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1`.
- The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Calculation:
- The value to be printed is `n - k + 1`.
- Since `n` and `k` are integers and their exact values are not provided, the output will be expressed in terms of `n` and `k`.

### Output:
The print statement will output `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1**
