The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.**
