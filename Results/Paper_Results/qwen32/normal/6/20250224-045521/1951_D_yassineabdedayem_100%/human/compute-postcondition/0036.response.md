Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `n - k + 1` is evaluated first.
- Since `n` and `k` are integers within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), the result of `n - k + 1` will also be an integer.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing the result of `n - k + 1`, a space should be printed instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
The code will print the value of the expression `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18})**
