The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are positive integers within a specific range, and the function will be called multiple times with different values of `n` and `k`. However, this code does not affect `n` or `k` in any way. It only introduces a new variable `t` with the value of the input.

Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer.**
