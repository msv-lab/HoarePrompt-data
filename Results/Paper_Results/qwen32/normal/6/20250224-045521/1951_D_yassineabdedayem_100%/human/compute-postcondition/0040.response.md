Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0. If `n == k`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
