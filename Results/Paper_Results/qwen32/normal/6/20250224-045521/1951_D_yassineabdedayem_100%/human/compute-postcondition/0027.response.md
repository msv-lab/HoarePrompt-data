Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2` holds, the condition is satisfied without any changes to `n` and `k`. If `n + 2 > k * 2` does not hold, the condition is not satisfied without any changes to `n` and `k`.**

In simpler terms: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range [1, 10^{18}] and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. No changes are made to `n` and `k` regardless of whether `n` equals `k` or the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds or not.**
