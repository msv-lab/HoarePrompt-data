The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, and `t`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.
2. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are defined and constrained in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the code is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
