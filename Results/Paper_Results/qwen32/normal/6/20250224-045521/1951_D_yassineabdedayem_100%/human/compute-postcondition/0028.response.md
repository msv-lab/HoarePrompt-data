Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold without any changes to `n` and `k`.**
