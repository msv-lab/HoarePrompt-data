The provided code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` may or may not hold, and there is a special case where `n` equals `k`.

The code `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input read from the standard input. Therefore, after the execution of this code, `n` and `k` will hold the new values read from the input, and `t` remains unchanged as it is not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.**
