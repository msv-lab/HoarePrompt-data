The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, and `t`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`:
   - `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `t` is an integer with the constraint \(t \geq 0\).

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
