### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation that can set a subarray to a specific value. The logic in the `func_1` function aims to find the smallest subarray that needs to be changed to make the entire array uniform.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization and Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j` and checks if the elements at these pointers are equal.
   - If `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`, both pointers are moved inward (`i` is incremented and `j` is decremented).
   - If `arr[i]` does not equal `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and the program checks if `i` has surpassed `j` (indicating the entire array is uniform). In this case, it returns `0` because no operation is needed.

2. **Finding the Subarray to Change**:
   - If the array is not uniform, the program then enters another while loop that increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` equals `arr[i + 1]`. This loop effectively finds the first position `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - After this loop, the program checks if `j` is not the last index of the array.
     - If `j` is not the last index, it means there is a subarray from `i` to `j` that needs to be changed. The cost of changing this subarray is `j - i + 1` burles.
     - If `j` is the last index, it means the subarray that needs to be changed is from `i` to the end of the array. The cost in this case is `j - i` burles.

While the logic seems to address the problem, there are some issues:

- The second while loop (`while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`) does not handle the case where `i` reaches the second last element and `arr[i]` equals `arr[i + 1]`. In such a scenario, `i` will be incremented one more time, leading to an `IndexError` when `arr[i + 1]` is accessed.
- The logic does not consider the optimal subarray to change. It simply finds the first non-uniform subarray from the start and end, which may not always be the optimal subarray to change to minimize the cost.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program may not always return the correct result, especially in cases where the optimal subarray to change is not the one found by the current logic. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
