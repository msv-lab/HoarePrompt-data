To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. The loop stops when `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- `i` is incremented by 3, meaning that `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i + 1]` was equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `arr[i + 2]` was equal to `arr[i + 3]` at the start of the 3rd iteration.
- The loop stops when `arr[i + 3]` is not equal to `arr[i + 4]`.

Thus, after the loop finishes, `i` will be incremented to the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`. `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

**Output State: i is incremented to the position where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1], and j is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `i` will point to the first element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and `j` will stay the same as it was initially.
