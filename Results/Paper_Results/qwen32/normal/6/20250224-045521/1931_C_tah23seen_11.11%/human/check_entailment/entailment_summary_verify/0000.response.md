### Reasoning:

The provided code and the function `func_1` are indeed incorrect based on the problem description. Let's break down the issues with the code and the original assessment.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function Purpose:**
   - The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of the described type.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function first tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal.
   - If the entire array is the same, it returns `0`.
   - If not, it calculates the cost to make the remaining elements equal by considering the longest contiguous subarray from the start or end that has the same elements.

3. **Flaws in the Logic:**
   - The function only considers one operation and does not explore all possible ways to minimize the cost. It does not account for the possibility of making multiple segments equal with a single operation.
   - The function does not correctly handle arrays where the optimal solution involves changing elements in the middle of the array.

#### Counterexample:

The original assessment provides a good counterexample:

```
Input:
1
4
1 2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- To make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` equal, we can perform the following operations:
  - Choose `i=1`, `j=2`, `x=1` → Array becomes `[1, 1, 1, 2]` (cost = 2 burles).
  - Choose `i=3`, `j=4`, `x=1` → Array becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]` (cost = 2 burles).
- Total cost = 2 burles.

However, the provided code will not produce `2` for this input. Instead, it will incorrectly calculate the cost based on the longest contiguous subarray from the start or end that has the same elements, which would not yield the optimal solution.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, particularly when the optimal solution requires more complex operations than simply making the longest contiguous subarray equal.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
