Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of making all elements of an array equal with the minimum cost using at most one operation that sets a subarray to a specific value. The cost of such an operation is the length of the subarray.

Let's analyze the function `func_1(arr)` to see if it correctly computes the minimum cost:

1. **Initial Checks and Boundaries**:
    - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
    - It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i <= j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`. This loop effectively reduces the array from both ends as long as the elements at the ends are equal.
    - If `i > j` after this loop, it means all elements were the same, and the function returns `0`.

2. **Identifying the Boundary**:
    - If not all elements are the same, the function then enters another while loop that increments `i` as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This loop finds the first position where the elements are not equal to the next element.
    - If `j` is not the last index of the array after this, the function returns `j - i + 1`. This means the cost to make the array uniform is the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
    - If `j` is the last index of the array, the function returns `j - i`. This handles the case where the longest uniform subarray is at the end of the array.

However, the logic in the function is flawed. Specifically, the function only considers making the array uniform by either:
- Making the entire array equal to the value of the first element (if the first and last elements are the same after the first loop).
- Making the array uniform by setting a subarray from `i` to `j` to a value if `j` is not the last index.
- Making the array uniform by setting a subarray from `i` to the end of the array if `j` is the last index.

The function does not consider other potential subarrays that could be set to a value to make the entire array uniform. For example, it does not consider setting a subarray in the middle of the array to a value that matches one of the ends or another subarray.

Given the examples provided in the problem statement, the function fails to provide the correct minimum cost in all cases. For instance, in the test case `1 2 3 4 5 1`, the function returns `4`, but the correct minimum cost is `2` (setting the middle four elements to `3`).

Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
