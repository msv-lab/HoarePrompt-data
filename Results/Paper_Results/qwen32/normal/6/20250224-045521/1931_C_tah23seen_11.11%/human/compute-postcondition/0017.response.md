Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `arr`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
