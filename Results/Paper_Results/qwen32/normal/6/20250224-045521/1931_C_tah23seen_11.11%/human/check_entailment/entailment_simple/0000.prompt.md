Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i and j are such that either i > j or arr[i] != arr[j].
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i and j are such that i is not greater than j, and either i > j or arr[i] != arr[j] is still true, implying that arr[i] != arr[j] must be the case.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. The loop stops when `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
    #- `i` is incremented by 3, meaning that `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i + 1]` was equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `arr[i + 2]` was equal to `arr[i + 3]` at the start of the 3rd iteration.
    #- The loop stops when `arr[i + 3]` is not equal to `arr[i + 4]`.
    #
    #Thus, after the loop finishes, `i` will be incremented to the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`. `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #**Output State: i is incremented to the position where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1], and j is unchanged.**
    #
    #In simpler terms, `i` will point to the first element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and `j` will stay the same as it was initially.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns `j - i + 1`, where `i` is the position in the array `arr` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is unchanged and not equal to the last index of `arr`.
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is unchanged. Additionally, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `len(arr) - 1` and the position `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
