The value of `i` is incremented by 1, as per the given code. The value of `j` remains unchanged. The relationship between the array elements `arr[i]`, `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 2]` is preserved, meaning that `arr[i]` is still equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is still equal to `arr[i + 2]`. 

Given that `i` was initially incremented by 1, after the execution of the code snippet, `i` will be incremented by another 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 2 more than its original value.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `j` is unchanged, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`.**
