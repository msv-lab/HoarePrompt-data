arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The total number of elements across all arrays in the input does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
