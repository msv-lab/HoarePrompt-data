The code snippet assigns the value `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. The length of `arr` is `n`, so `j` will be `n - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
