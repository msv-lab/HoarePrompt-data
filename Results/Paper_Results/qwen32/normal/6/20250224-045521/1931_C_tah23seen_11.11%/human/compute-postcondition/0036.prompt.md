You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i and j are such that either i > j or arr[i] != arr[j].
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i and j are such that i is not greater than j, and either i > j or arr[i] != arr[j] is still true, implying that arr[i] != arr[j] must be the case.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. The loop stops when `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
    #- `i` is incremented by 3, meaning that `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i + 1]` was equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `arr[i + 2]` was equal to `arr[i + 3]` at the start of the 3rd iteration.
    #- The loop stops when `arr[i + 3]` is not equal to `arr[i + 4]`.
    #
    #Thus, after the loop finishes, `i` will be incremented to the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`. `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #**Output State: i is incremented to the position where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1], and j is unchanged.**
    #
    #In simpler terms, `i` will point to the first element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and `j` will stay the same as it was initially.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns `j - i + 1`, where `i` is the position in the array `arr` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is unchanged and not equal to the last index of `arr`.
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is unchanged. Additionally, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `len(arr) - 1` and the position `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns 0 if all elements in `arr` are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from the beginning or ending at the end where all elements are the same. Specifically, it returns `j - i + 1` if there is a position `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `j` is the last index of `arr`. If no such `i` exists, it returns the difference between `len(arr) - 1` and the position `i` where the element changes, indicating the length of the contiguous subarray at the end.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns `j - i + 1`, where `i` is the position in the array `arr` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is unchanged and not equal to the last index of `arr`.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between `len(arr) - 1` and the position `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
