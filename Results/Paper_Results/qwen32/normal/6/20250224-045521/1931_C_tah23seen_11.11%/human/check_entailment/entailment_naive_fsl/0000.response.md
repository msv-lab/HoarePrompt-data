Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. It tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal and then calculates the cost to make the remaining elements equal. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal.

Here is a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation of the expected output: 
We can make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` equal by choosing `i=1`, `j=4`, and `x=1` or `x=2`. In either case, the cost is `4 - 1 + 1 = 4` burles, but we can do better by choosing `i=1`, `j=2`, and `x=1` and then `i=3`, `j=4`, and `x=1` or `x=2` which would cost `2` burles in total.

However, the provided code will not produce `2` for this input. Instead, it will return `3` or some other incorrect value because it only considers one operation and does not explore other possible ways to minimize the cost.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
