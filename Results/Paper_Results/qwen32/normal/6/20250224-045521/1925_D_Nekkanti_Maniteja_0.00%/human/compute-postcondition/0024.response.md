The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer read from the input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop is `for i in range(int(input())):`, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
