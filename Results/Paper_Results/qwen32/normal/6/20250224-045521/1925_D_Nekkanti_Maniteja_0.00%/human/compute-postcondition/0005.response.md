Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
