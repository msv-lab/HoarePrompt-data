To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's carefully analyze the provided loop and the given output states after the first few iterations.

The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by `m` lines of input specifying pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. The variable `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, where `M = 10^9 + 7`. The variable `a` is the sum of all `f_i` values. The variable `s` is computed based on `c`, `a`, `m`, and `k`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the general form of `s` for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `s` is computed as:
\[ s = c \cdot a \cdot k + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \]

This formula is derived from the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```
which can be simplified to:
\[ s = c \cdot a \cdot k + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \left( \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i \right) \]
\[ s = c \cdot a \cdot k + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \]

Since the loop processes `t` test cases independently, the final output after all iterations is simply the result of computing `s` for each test case and printing it.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **the final `s` value computed for each of the `t` test cases, printed one per line.**

In natural language: After all the iterations, the program will have computed and printed the final value of `s` for each of the `t` test cases, where `s` is calculated using the formula \( s = c \cdot a \cdot k + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) for each test case.
