You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with `m` lines of edge data. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value `s` based on the given parameters and edge values, ensuring the result is within a modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for k randomly chosen pairs of children over multiple test cases. The expected value should be expressed in the form of \( \frac{p}{q} \), and the result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # c is the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - The variable `c` is intended to be the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \). However, the code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) which is not correct. It should be the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), i.e., `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` is being updated in a loop over `k` excursions, but the formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves a more complex combinatorial approach.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct. The expected value for each pair of friends is calculated based on the probability of being chosen and the increasing friendship value over time. The correct approach involves summing the expected values over all possible pairs and considering the increasing friendship values.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic for the final result, but the intermediate calculations need to be corrected.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. Calculate the expected value for each pair of friends, considering the increasing friendship values.
3. Sum the expected values for all pairs and compute the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
