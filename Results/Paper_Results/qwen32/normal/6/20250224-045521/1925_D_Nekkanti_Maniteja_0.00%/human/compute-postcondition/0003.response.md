The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M` and assigns it to the variable `c`. Since `n * (n - 1) // 1` simplifies to `n * (n - 1)`, `c` will hold the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.**
