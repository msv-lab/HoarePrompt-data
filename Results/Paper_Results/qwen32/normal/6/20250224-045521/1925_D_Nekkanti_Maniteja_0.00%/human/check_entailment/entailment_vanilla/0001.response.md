Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for k randomly chosen pairs of children over multiple test cases. The expected value should be expressed in the form of \( \frac{p}{q} \), and the result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # c is the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - The variable `c` is intended to be the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \). However, the code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) which is not correct. It should be the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), i.e., `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` is being updated in a loop over `k` excursions, but the formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves a more complex combinatorial approach.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct. The expected value for each pair of friends is calculated based on the probability of being chosen and the increasing friendship value over time. The correct approach involves summing the expected values over all possible pairs and considering the increasing friendship values.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic for the final result, but the intermediate calculations need to be corrected.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. Calculate the expected value for each pair of friends, considering the increasing friendship values.
3. Sum the expected values for all pairs and compute the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
