Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are new integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + k`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
