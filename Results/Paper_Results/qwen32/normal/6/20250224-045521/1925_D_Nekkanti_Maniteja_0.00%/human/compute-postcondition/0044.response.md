The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + 1` and `k` must be greater than `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + 2`, `k` must be greater than `m + 2`**
