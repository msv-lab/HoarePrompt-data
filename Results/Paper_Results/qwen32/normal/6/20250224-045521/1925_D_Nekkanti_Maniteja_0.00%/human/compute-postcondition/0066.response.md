The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is uninitialized (or 0, but it will be set by the loop), and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is uninitialized (or 0) at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 1, and `k` must be greater than 1.

The state of `s` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1**
