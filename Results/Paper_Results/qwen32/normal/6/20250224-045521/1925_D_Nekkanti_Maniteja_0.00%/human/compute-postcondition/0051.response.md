The code snippet updates the value of `c` to be the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are new integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + k`.**
