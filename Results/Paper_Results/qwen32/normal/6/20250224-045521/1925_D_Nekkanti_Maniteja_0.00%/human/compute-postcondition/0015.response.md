To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables change with each iteration. The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `u`, `v`, and `f` from the input and adds the value of `f` to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state and the state after the first three iterations, we can infer that after `m` iterations, the variable `a` will be the sum of all `f` values read during the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not modified inside the loop.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing `m` times, `a` will hold the total sum of all `f` values that were read in each iteration, while all other variables will remain in their initial state.
