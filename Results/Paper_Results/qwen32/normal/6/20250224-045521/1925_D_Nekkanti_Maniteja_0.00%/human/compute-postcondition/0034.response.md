The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. This means the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated based on the input provided.

The initial state specifies that `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers as read from the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing the code, the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f`, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
