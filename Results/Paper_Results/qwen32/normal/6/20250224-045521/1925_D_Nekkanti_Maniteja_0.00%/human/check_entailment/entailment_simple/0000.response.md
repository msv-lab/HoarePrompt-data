Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, but it contains several logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `c`:**  
   The variable `c` is initialized as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is intended to be the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs (which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`). However, the denominator in the `pow` function is incorrectly written as `1`, which would always result in `c` being `1` (since `1^-1 mod M` is `1`). It should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Accumulating the Total Friendship Value `a`:**  
   The variable `a` is used to accumulate the total initial friendship value of all friend pairs. This part is correct.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value `s`:**  
   The loop that calculates `s` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be computed by considering the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions. The current implementation incorrectly adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration of `k`, which does not reflect the correct expected value calculation.

   The correct approach would involve calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum over `k` excursions, taking into account the probability of being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship value.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**  
   The final result is computed modulo `M`, which is correct. However, due to the incorrect logic in the calculation of `s`, the final result will not be accurate.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
