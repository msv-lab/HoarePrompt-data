To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the expressions involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `M` is a constant value: \(1000000007\).
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.
- `s` is calculated as \(c^2 \cdot m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k / 2 + c \cdot a \cdot k\).
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
- `i` is calculated as \(m + k - 1\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `c`**:
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`. This means \(c\) is the number such that \((n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot c) \mod M = 1\).

2. **Calculate `s`**:
   - `s` involves several components:
     - \(c^2 \cdot m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k / 2\): This part involves squaring `c`, multiplying by `m`, and then by \((k-1) \cdot k / 2\).
     - \(c \cdot a \cdot k\): This part involves multiplying `c` by `a` and then by `k`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final value printed is `s % M`, which means we take the result of `s` and find its remainder when divided by `M`.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print(s % M)` statement is the result of the expression `s % M` where `s` is calculated as described above. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` (the sum of `f` values) are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `s`. However, we can describe the expression precisely.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007, a is the sum of all f values read from the input, m, n, and k are integers read from the input, and M is 1000000007)**
