Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. The value of `pergunta` remains as the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `i` are not changed by this code snippet.
