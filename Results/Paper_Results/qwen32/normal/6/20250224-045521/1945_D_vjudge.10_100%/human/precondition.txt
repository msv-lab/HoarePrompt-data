pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). a is a list of n integers where each a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost for Kirill to exchange places with the person at position i. b is a list of n integers where each b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost for Kirill to pass through person at position k when exchanging places with a person at position j such that j < k < i. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
