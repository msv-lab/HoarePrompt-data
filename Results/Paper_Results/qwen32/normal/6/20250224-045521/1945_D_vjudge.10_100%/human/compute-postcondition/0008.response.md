Postcondition: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. If `i < m`, then `i` is incremented by 1 (if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n-1`). If `i` is not less than `m`, no further changes are made to `i`.**
