You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a list of integers representing the number of test cases, a is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the a_i values for each test case, b is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the b_i values for each test case, n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of people in the queue for each test case, and m is a list of integers where each integer represents the maximum allowable final position of Kirill for each test case. It is guaranteed that the length of pergunta, a, b, n, and m are the same, and for each test case, 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` for all `i < m` after all iterations. `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `0`. `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, and `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `0`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. `pergunta` is a list of integers representing the number of test cases. `a` and `b` are 2D lists of integers where each sublist contains `n` integers representing the `a_i` and `b_i` values for each test case, respectively. `n` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of people in the queue for each test case, and `m` is a list of integers where each integer represents the maximum allowable final position of Kirill for each test case. The function returns a list of results for each test case. For each test case, if it is possible for Kirill to end up in a position no greater than `m` based on the given `a_i` and `b_i` values, the function returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
