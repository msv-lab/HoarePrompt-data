Postcondition: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `i < m`, then `pergunta` is recalculated as the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `pergunta`.**
