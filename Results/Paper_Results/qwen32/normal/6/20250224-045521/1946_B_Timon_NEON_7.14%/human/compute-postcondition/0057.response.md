The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If the list has at least one segment, the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one segment for the loop to execute. Given the information about `segments_variants`, it already contains at least one segment, which is `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` or `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. Hence, no additional adjustments are needed for `segments_variants` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`**
