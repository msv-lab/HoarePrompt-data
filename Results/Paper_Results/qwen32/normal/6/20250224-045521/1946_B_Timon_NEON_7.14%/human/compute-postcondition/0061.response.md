The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `segment` for the next iteration of the loop. The variable `segments_variants` is the iterable, and `segment` takes the value of each element in `segments_variants` one by one.

At the end of the previous iteration, `segment` was the last element in `segments_variants`. To execute the loop one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least one more element that `segment` can take. However, since the problem does not specify any additional elements in `segments_variants` beyond what was described, we can infer that the loop will terminate if there are no more elements in `segments_variants`. 

Given the current state, we can assume the next `segment` will be the next element in `segments_variants` if it exists. Since the exact elements of `segments_variants` are not specified beyond the last one, we cannot determine the exact next `segment`. However, we can represent the state in a generic way assuming there is a next element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`**
