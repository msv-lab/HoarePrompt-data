The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and a list containing the value `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value `i - 1` is `-1`. Therefore, the new list added to `segments_variants` is `new_segment + [-1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is `[new_segment + [-1]]`, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**
