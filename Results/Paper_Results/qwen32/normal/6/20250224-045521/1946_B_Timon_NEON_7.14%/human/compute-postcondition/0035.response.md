Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. `new_segment` is now set to `[arr[1], 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `new_segment` is updated to be `[arr[1], 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
