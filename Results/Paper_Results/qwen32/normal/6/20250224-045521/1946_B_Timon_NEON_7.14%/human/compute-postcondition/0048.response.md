Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2. If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` includes `new_segment + [1]` if `new_segment[0]` is not greater than `max_segment[0]`, and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are both increased by `arr[2]`.**
