Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0.**
