The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`, where the new list is the combination of `new_segment` and a list containing `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the new list being appended to `segments_variants` is `new_segment + [1]`.

Since `segments_variants` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it was previously an empty list or a list with some elements. The code modifies `segments_variants` by adding a new element to it, but the values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [1]`**.
