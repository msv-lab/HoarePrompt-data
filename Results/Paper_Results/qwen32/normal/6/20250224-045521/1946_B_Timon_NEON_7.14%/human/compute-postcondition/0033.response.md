Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`; otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`; `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list; `max_sum` is -1; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `new_segment[0]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. If `arr[0]` was initially greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` was `[arr[0], 0]`, and after the operation, it becomes `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
