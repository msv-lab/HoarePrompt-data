Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[1]` is not less than 0, otherwise `new_segment` is `[]`. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains `[]` and `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison logic with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` is `[]` and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `arr[1]` is less than 0 and `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` or determined by the comparison logic. `segments_variants` is updated to include `max_segment + [0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1], [arr[0], 0, 0]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]` depending on its initial state if `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is less than 0. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` remains unchanged. `max_sum` is -1 and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2. If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` includes `new_segment + [1]` if `new_segment[0]` is not greater than `max_segment[0]`, and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `new_segment` is `[2 * arr[2], 2]` or `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are both increased by `arr[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
