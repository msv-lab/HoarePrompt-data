The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `max_segment` is being updated and no other variables are affected, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [1]`, `max_segment` is `new_segment`**.
