Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is `[]`, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, then `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` and `segments_variants` is `[[0, 0, -1]]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[new_segment + [-1]]`. `max_segment[0]` is `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `max_segment[0]` is updated to be the value of `arr[i]`, which is less than 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
