Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[1]` is not less than 0, otherwise `new_segment` is `[]`. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains `[]` and `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison logic with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` is `[]` and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `arr[1]` is less than 0 and `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` or determined by the comparison logic. `segments_variants` is updated to include `max_segment + [0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1], [arr[0], 0, 0]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]` depending on its initial state if `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `arr[1]` is less than 0. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` remains unchanged. `max_sum` is -1 and `i` is 1.**
