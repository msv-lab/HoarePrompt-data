Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_max_segment` is updated to `[-1]`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
