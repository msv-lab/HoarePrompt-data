The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of `max_segment`. Given that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, the first element of `max_segment` will increase by a non-negative amount. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
