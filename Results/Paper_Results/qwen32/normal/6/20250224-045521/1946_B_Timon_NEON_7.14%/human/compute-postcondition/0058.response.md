Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. `max_sum` is -1 initially. `total_max_segment` is `[-1]` initially. The current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is less than the current value of `segment[0]`.**
