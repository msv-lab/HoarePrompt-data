The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants` after the current `segment`, `total_max_segment` is `segment`**.
