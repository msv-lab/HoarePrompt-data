### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing `k` operations. In each operation, you can select any contiguous subarray of `a`, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Observations:

1. **Finding the Maximum Sum Subarray**: The optimal strategy is to identify the maximum sum subarray in the array `a` using Kadane's algorithm or a similar approach. This subarray's sum will be the most beneficial to add repeatedly to maximize the total sum.

2. **Repeating the Maximum Sum Subarray**: Once the maximum sum subarray is identified, you can repeatedly add its sum to the total sum of the array up to `k` times. This is because adding the maximum sum subarray's sum will always yield the highest possible increase in the total sum.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum sum subarray will be the least negative number (or zero if the array contains zeros).
   - If the array contains zero or positive numbers, the maximum sum subarray will be the sum of the contiguous subarray with the highest sum.

#### Code Analysis:

Let's evaluate the provided code against the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Correctness**: True.

2. **Function `func_2(arr)`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, the logic is flawed:
     - The logic of maintaining `new_segment` and `max_segment` seems incorrect. It does not correctly handle the transition between segments and does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
     - The function does not handle cases where all numbers are negative correctly.
     - **Correctness**: False.

3. **Function `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is not implemented and does not contribute to the solution.
   - **Correctness**: False.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program is incorrect because it relies on `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray, but `func_2` does not correctly implement this functionality.
   - The formula used to compute the final answer (`max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`) is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - **Correctness**: False.

#### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues lie in the incorrect implementation of `func_2` and the incorrect formula used to compute the final answer.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
