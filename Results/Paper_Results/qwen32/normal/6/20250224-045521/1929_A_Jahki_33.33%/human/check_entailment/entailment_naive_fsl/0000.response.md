Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The program contains a logical error in the function `func_1` and the way it handles the input and output.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` for the beauty of the array. However, this is incorrect because the beauty of the array can still be non-zero even if the array is sorted. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the beauty is `2`, not `0`.

2. **Handling Input**: The code reads input for each test case, but it does not handle the case correctly if the array elements are not digits (though the problem guarantees they are). The condition `if i.isdigit()` in the list comprehension is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly formatted.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty**: The code sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This part seems correct, but it is not executed if the array is already sorted according to `func_1`.

To correct the program, the function `func_1` should be removed, and the beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for every test case.
