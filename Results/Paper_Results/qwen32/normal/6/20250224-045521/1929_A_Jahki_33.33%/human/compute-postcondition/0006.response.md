Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num2` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `order` is `order + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `order` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
