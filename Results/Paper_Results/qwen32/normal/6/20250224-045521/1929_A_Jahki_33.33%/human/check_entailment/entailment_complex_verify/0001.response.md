### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array in increasing order using `sorted(a)`. This is a valid approach to maximize the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements will be maximized in this order.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Unnecessary Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is unnecessary because the beauty should always be calculated based on the sorted array regardless of the initial order. The function's logic is flawed since it incorrectly returns `True` only if the array is strictly increasing, not non-decreasing.

4. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The program incorrectly prints `0` if the array is already sorted according to `func_1`. This is incorrect because even if the array is sorted, the beauty should still be calculated and printed as the sum of differences in the sorted array.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty based on the sorted array.
- The function `func_1` and its corresponding print statement should be removed or corrected.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrectly used function `func_1`. The beauty should always be calculated for the sorted array, and the program should not incorrectly print `0` based on the initial order of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
