Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the maximum beauty of an array. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after arranging the array in any way. The goal is to maximize this sum.

### Key Idea:
To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in increasing order. This way, each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be non-negative and maximized given the sorted order.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array in increasing order, we ensure that each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` is as large as possible.
2. **Calculate Beauty**: Compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array using `sorted(a)`.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: It calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program includes a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this function is not correctly used in the main logic and seems unnecessary for solving the problem. The program incorrectly prints `0` if the array is already sorted, which is not always correct.

### Issues in the Given Program:
- The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly used. The beauty should always be calculated as the sum of differences in the sorted array, regardless of the initial order.
- The `func_1` check and its corresponding print statement should be removed or corrected.

### Corrected Logic:
- Always sort the array.
- Calculate the beauty as the sum of differences in the sorted array.
- Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrectly used function `func_1`. The beauty should always be calculated for the sorted array.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
