To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following:
- The loop variable `i` which starts at 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is the integer input provided, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.

To ensure the loop can execute:
- The value of `n` must be at least 2, as specified in the problem statement. This ensures that the range `(1, n + 1)` is valid and contains at least one element.
- The loop variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized to the starting value of the range (which is 1 in this case).

Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that we need to ensure is `n`, and it must meet the condition 2 <= `n` <= 10^3. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3**
