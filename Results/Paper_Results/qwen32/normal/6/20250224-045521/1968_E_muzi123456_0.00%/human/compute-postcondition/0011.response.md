The provided `print` statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

In this statement, the `print` function is called with two arguments:
- The first argument is the string `'1'`, which is the value to be printed.
- The second argument is `end=' '`, which specifies that after printing the string `'1'`, a space `' '` should be printed instead of the default newline character.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the given `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this `print` statement.

Based on the information provided, the output will be:
Output: **1 ** (where the output is the number 1 followed by a space)
