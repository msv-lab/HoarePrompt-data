In the given task, the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The state at the end of the previous iteration is provided, and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.
- Loop statement: `for i in range(1, n + 1):`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the loop variable `i` since it's the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value from 1 to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `n`.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a value `k` such that 1 <= k <= n.
2. For the next iteration, `i` must be `k + 1`.
3. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `k` could be any value from 1 to `n - 1` (because if `k` were `n`, the loop would have just ended), `i` will be a value from 2 to `n`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `t` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains the same because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, `i` is an integer such that 2 <= `i` <= `n`**
