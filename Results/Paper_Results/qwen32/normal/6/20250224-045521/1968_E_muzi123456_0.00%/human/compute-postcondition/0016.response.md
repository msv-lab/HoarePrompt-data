The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, and `i` is an integer equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, `i` is an integer equal to `n + 1`.**
