Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **t**: It is mentioned that `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. However, the exact value of `t` is not explicitly given, so we can't determine its precise value. But it is important to note that `t` has been decremented by 1.
2. **n**: It is mentioned that `n` must be at least 1. The exact value of `n` is not provided.
3. **i**: It is explicitly stated that `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the `print(i)` statement will simply output `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
