Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements.

The task is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells chosen in an n x n grid. The program should output n points for each test case.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Output Generation**:
   - For each test case, it prints `n` points. Each point is printed as `1 i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`.

### Evaluation:

- **Output Format**: The program outputs `n` points for each test case. However, the points are all in the first row of the grid (i.e., all points have `x = 1`).
- **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
  - The Manhattan distance between points `(1, i)` and `(1, j)` is `|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|`.
  - The possible distances are `0, 1, 2, ..., n-1`.
  - This means the set of distinct Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`, which has a size of `n`.
- **Maximizing Distances**:
  - The provided solution is not optimal for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, placing points in a diagonal or zigzag pattern could potentially yield more distinct distances.
  - The problem statement and examples suggest that the goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, which is not achieved by placing all points in a single row.

### Conclusion:

While the program does output `n` points for each test case, it does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
