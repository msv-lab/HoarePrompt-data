The loop in question is controlled by the variable `t`:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is not zero. Since `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

The variables `n` and `i` are not part of the loop condition and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

So, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, `i` is an integer equal to `n + 1`**
