The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

This statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, but it will not end the line because of the `end=' '` parameter, which specifies that a space should be used instead of the default newline character.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string '1' followed by a space)
