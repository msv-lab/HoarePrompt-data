Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply outputs points along the first row of the grid, which results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\) only produce Manhattan distances of 0 and 1, whereas the optimal solution can produce a set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a different strategy is required, such as placing points in a way that covers a wide range of Manhattan distances. The example outputs provided in the problem statement show how this can be achieved.
