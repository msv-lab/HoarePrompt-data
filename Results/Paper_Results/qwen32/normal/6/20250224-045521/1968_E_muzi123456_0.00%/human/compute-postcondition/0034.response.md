Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This statement doesn't directly affect the value of `i` or what is printed, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.)
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
- `n` is at least 1.

Since `n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `i` would be `1 + 1 = 2`.

However, `n` can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, so `i` can be any integer greater than or equal to 2.

Given the information, we can describe the output as:
Output: **i (where i is n + 1 and n is at least 1)**

Since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `i`, but we know the relationship between `i` and `n`.

To provide a more precise description based on the precondition:
Output: **i (where i is n + 1 and n is at least 1)**
