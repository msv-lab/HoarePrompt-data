### Reasoning:
The provided code is supposed to output n points in an n x n grid for each test case in a way that maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances, \(\mathcal{H}\).

However, the code does not achieve this goal. Instead, it outputs points that lie on a single row (the first row) of the grid. Specifically, for a given \( n \), the points output are (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n). This results in a very limited set of distinct Manhattan distances, primarily just 0 (for the distance from a point to itself) and values from 1 to \( n-1 \) (for the distances between points on the same row).

The optimal solution involves placing the points in such a way that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized. One way to achieve this is by placing points on the perimeter of the grid or in a pattern that ensures a wide variety of distances.

For example, for \( n = 3 \), an optimal arrangement could be (1,1), (1,3), (3,1) which would yield distinct Manhattan distances of 0, 2, 1, and 3.

The given code does not implement such a strategy and therefore does not solve the problem as intended.
