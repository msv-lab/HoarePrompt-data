You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if there exists at least one position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`) where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:

The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20. It then processes these strings and prints "increasing" if `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b` and `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, "decreasing" if `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` and `b` is lexicographically larger than `c`, and "neither" in all other cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules for a string `s` to match a template `t` are:
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be the same as the `i-th` character of `t`.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the characters of `a` and `b` at position `i` are different from the character of `c` at position `i`. If such a position exists, it returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if `func_1` correctly determines the existence of a valid template `t` for each test case.

The provided `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where the characters of `a` and `b` at position `i` are different from the character of `c` at position `i`. However, this does not guarantee that such a template `t` can be constructed that satisfies all positions.

Consider the example:
```
3
acc
abd
abc
```
- For position `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'a'`, `c[0] = 'a'`. Here, `a[0]` and `b[0]` are the same as `c[0]`, so we cannot use an uppercase 'A' in the template.
- For position `i = 1`, `a[1] = 'c'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, `c[1] = 'b'`. Here, `a[1]` is different from `c[1]` and `b[1]` is different from `c[1]`, so we can use an uppercase 'C' in the template.
- For position `i = 2`, `a[2] = 'c'`, `b[2] = 'd'`, `c[2] = 'c'`. Here, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are different from `c[2]`, so we can use an uppercase 'C' in the template.

Thus, a valid template `t` could be "CBC", which matches `a` and `b` but does not match `c`.

However, the `func_1` function only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns `'YES'`. This is not sufficient to guarantee that we can construct a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c` for all positions.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template `t` for all positions. It only checks for the existence of at least one position where the characters of `a` and `b` are different from the character of `c`, which is not sufficient.

Correctness: **False**
