Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not match it. 

The provided function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. However, this logic is not sufficient to ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match it for all positions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then we can choose a template character that matches both `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is an example where the current program fails:
```
Input:
1
2
ab
ab
aa

Output:
YES

Expected Output:
NO
```

In this example, `a` and `b` are both "ab", and `c` is "aa". There is no template that can match both "ab" while not matching "aa" at both positions. The current program incorrectly returns "YES" because at position 1, `a[1] != c[1]` and `b[1] != c[1]`, but this does not ensure that a valid template exists that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then there should be a character that matches both `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected function ensures that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid.
