The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`, which is the number of iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 if the loop had executed.

Given that `t` is an integer greater than 0 at the start of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it is still positive.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
