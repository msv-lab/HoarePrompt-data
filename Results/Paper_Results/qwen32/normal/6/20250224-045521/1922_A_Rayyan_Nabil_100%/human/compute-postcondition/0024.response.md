The given code snippet has a `print(result)` statement, but the initial state does not mention a variable named `result`. Instead, it mentions a variable named `results`, which is a list containing at least two elements. Since there is no `result` variable defined, it seems there might be a typo in the code snippet.

Assuming the intention was to print an element from the `results` list, we need more information to determine which element of `results` should be printed. However, based on the provided information, we can only conclude that the code as written will likely raise a `NameError` because `result` is not defined.

However, if we consider the most likely scenario where the intention was to print the last element of the `results` list (a common practice when `results` is a list of results from iterations), the output would be the last element of the `results` list.

Given the initial state, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **results[-1] (where results is a list containing at least two elements)**

If the intention was to print a different element, please provide more details or correct the variable name in the code snippet.
