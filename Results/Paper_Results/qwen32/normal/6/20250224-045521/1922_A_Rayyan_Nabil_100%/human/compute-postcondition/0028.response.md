Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. The function returns a value based on the comparison of these strings. Case_1: If `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b` and `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, the function returns "increasing". Case_2: If `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` and `b` is lexicographically larger than `c`, the function returns "decreasing". Case_3: In all other cases, the function returns "neither".**
