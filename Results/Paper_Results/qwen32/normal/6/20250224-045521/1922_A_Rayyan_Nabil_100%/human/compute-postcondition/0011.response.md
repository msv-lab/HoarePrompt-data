The code snippet provided updates the value of `b` by reading a new input string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigning it to `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, `c`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the new input), `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
