To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the provided code snippet on the existing variables. The code snippet appends the result of a function call `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. 

Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `results`. However, we do know that `results` will no longer be an empty list but will contain one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `results` list, while all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
