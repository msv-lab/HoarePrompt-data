Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules for a string `s` to match a template `t` are:
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be the same as the `i-th` character of `t`.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the characters of `a` and `b` at position `i` are different from the character of `c` at position `i`. If such a position exists, it returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if `func_1` correctly determines the existence of a valid template `t` for each test case.

The provided `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where the characters of `a` and `b` at position `i` are different from the character of `c` at position `i`. However, this does not guarantee that such a template `t` can be constructed that satisfies all positions.

Consider the example:
```
3
acc
abd
abc
```
- For position `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'a'`, `c[0] = 'a'`. Here, `a[0]` and `b[0]` are the same as `c[0]`, so we cannot use an uppercase 'A' in the template.
- For position `i = 1`, `a[1] = 'c'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, `c[1] = 'b'`. Here, `a[1]` is different from `c[1]` and `b[1]` is different from `c[1]`, so we can use an uppercase 'C' in the template.
- For position `i = 2`, `a[2] = 'c'`, `b[2] = 'd'`, `c[2] = 'c'`. Here, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are different from `c[2]`, so we can use an uppercase 'C' in the template.

Thus, a valid template `t` could be "CBC", which matches `a` and `b` but does not match `c`.

However, the `func_1` function only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns `'YES'`. This is not sufficient to guarantee that we can construct a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c` for all positions.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template `t` for all positions. It only checks for the existence of at least one position where the characters of `a` and `b` are different from the character of `c`, which is not sufficient.

Correctness: **False**
