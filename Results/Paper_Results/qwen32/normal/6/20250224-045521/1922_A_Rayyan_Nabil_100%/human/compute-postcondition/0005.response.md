The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` by taking a new input from the user, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigning it to `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, `c`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is an empty list.**
