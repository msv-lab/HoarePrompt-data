Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `values` is a list containing integers from 0 to 9: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
- `sum_values` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `values`. This means `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.
- `total` is the sum of all elements in `values`, which is 45.
- `n` is 10.

The print statement is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

However, there is an issue here. The list `sum_values` has indices from 0 to 9 (since it has 10 elements). The variable `n` is 10, which is out of bounds for the list `sum_values`. 

In Python, trying to access an index that is out of bounds will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not print anything as it will raise an error.

But if we assume the intention was to access the last element of `sum_values` (which would be `sum_values[n-1]`), then the value at index 9 of `sum_values` is 45.

Given the problem's format, we should assume the intention was to access the last element of the list `sum_values` since `n` is the length of the list.

Therefore, the correct output, assuming the intention was to access the last element, would be:

Output: **45 (where 45 is the last element of the sum_values list)**

However, strictly adhering to the given code which will raise an error, the precise output would indicate an error. Since the task specifically asks for what is printed, and the code does not print anything due to the error, we should indicate the out-of-bounds error:

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
