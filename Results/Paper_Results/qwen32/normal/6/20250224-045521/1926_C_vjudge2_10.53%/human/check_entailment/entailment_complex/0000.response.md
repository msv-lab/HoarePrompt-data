### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is intended to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - It stores each `n` from the test cases in the list `numbers`.
   - It initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of size `max(numbers) + 1`. 
     - `values` will store the sum of the digits of each number from 0 to `max(numbers)`.
     - `sum_values` will store the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to each index.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - For numbers 0 to 9, it initializes `values` with the numbers themselves since the sum of the digits of a single-digit number is the number itself.
   - It also initializes `sum_values` with cumulative sums up to 9.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For numbers 10 and above, it calculates the sum of the digits by splitting the number into its last digit and the remainder.
   - For example, for `i = 23`, it calculates `values[23]` as `values[3] + values[2]` which is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - It then updates `sum_values[i]` as the cumulative sum up to `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case `n`, it prints `sum_values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- The logic for calculating the sum of digits and storing cumulative sums seems correct.
- However, there is a critical issue in the loop that calculates `values` and `sum_values` for numbers 10 and above:
  - The loop iterates only up to `n` which is the last `n` read from the input, not up to `max(numbers)`.
  - This means that if `numbers` contains multiple `n` values, the loop will not correctly compute `values` and `sum_values` for all possible `n` in `numbers`.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the function is **incorrect** because it does not handle multiple `n` values correctly. It only computes `values` and `sum_values` up to the last `n` read, which may not be sufficient for all test cases.

**Correctness: False**
