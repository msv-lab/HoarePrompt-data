To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `values` and `sum_values` lists. The loop runs from `i = 10` to `i = n`, where `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but we can infer it based on the pattern of the loop's effect on the lists.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
   - `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`
   - `total` is `45`

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For each `i` from `10` to `n`, the loop calculates:
     - `word` as the string representation of `i`.
     - `last` as the last digit of `i`.
     - `remainder` as the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.
     - `values[i]` as `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
     - `sum_total` as `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
     - `sum_values[i]` as `sum_total`.

From the given output states for the first 3 iterations, we can see the pattern:
- For `i = 10`, `values[10] = values[0] + values[1] = 0 + 1 = 1`, `sum_values[10] = 1 + 45 = 46`.
- For `i = 11`, `values[11] = values[1] + values[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`, `sum_values[11] = 2 + 46 = 48`.
- For `i = 12`, `values[12] = values[2] + values[1] = 2 + 1 = 3`, `sum_values[12] = 3 + 48 = 51`.

The loop continues in this manner, and we need to determine the final state after all iterations. Since the problem does not specify `n`, we can assume `n` is large enough to cover all possible two-digit numbers, which is `99`.

Let's calculate the final state for `n = 99`:

- `values` will have `values[10]` to `values[99]` calculated based on the pattern.
- `sum_values` will have `sum_values[10]` to `sum_values[99]` calculated based on the pattern.

The final state will be:

- `values` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47
