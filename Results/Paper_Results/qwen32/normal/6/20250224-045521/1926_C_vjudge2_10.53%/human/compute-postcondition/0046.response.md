The code snippet `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` modifies the list `values` by setting the element at index `i` to the sum of the elements at indices `last` and `remainder`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 12
- `last` is 2
- `remainder` is 1
- `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]`

The element at index `last` (which is 2) in `values` is `2`, and the element at index `remainder` (which is 1) in `values` is `1`. Therefore, the sum `values[last] + values[remainder]` is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Thus, `values[12]` is set to `3`. Since the list `values` originally had 11 elements, this operation extends the list to have 13 elements with the new value `3` at index `12`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 47]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `word` is "12", `last` is `2`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `47`, `i` is 12.**
