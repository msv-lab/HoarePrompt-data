Given the code snippet `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]`, we need to determine the new state of the `values` list based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers.
- `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
- `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.
- `total` is `45`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
- `word` is the string representation of `i`.
- `last` is the last digit of `i`.
- `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.

### Code Execution Impact:
The code `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` modifies the `values` list at index `i` by setting it to the sum of the values at indices `last` and `remainder`. 

### New State Calculation:
- `last` is the last digit of `i`.
- `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.
- `values[i]` is updated to `values[last] + values[remainder]`.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, let's consider an example where `i` is 12 (as an example, any `i >= 10` will work similarly):

- If `i` is 12:
  - `last` is `2` (last digit of 12).
  - `remainder` is `1` (12 with the last digit removed).
  - `values[12]` would be calculated as `values[2] + values[1]` which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

However, since `values` is initially defined up to index 9, `i` cannot be 12 directly. Let's assume `i` is 10 for this example:

- If `i` is 10:
  - `last` is `0` (last digit of 10).
  - `remainder` is `1` (10 with the last digit removed).
  - `values[10]` would be calculated as `values[0] + values[1]` which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

Since `values` is initially defined up to index 9, the code does not directly modify `values` for `i >= 10` without expanding the list. If we assume the list is expanded or `i` is within the initial bounds (0-9), let's consider `i` is 9 for a valid example:

- If `i` is 9:
  - `last` is `9` (last digit of 9).
  - `remainder` is `0` (9 with the last digit removed).
  - `values[9]` would be calculated as `values[9] + values[0]` which is `9 + 0 = 9`.

Thus, `values[9]` remains unchanged in this case.

### Final Output State:
Since the initial state specifies `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, and `values` is initially defined up to index 9, the code does not directly modify `values` without expanding the list. If we assume `i` is within the initial bounds (0-9), the state remains unchanged for `values` as per the provided examples.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the last digit of `i`, `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.**
