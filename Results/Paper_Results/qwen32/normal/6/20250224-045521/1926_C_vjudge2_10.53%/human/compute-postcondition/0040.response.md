The code snippet calculates the new value of `sum_total` using the values from the `values` and `sum_values` lists at specific indices. Given that `i` is 11, `values[11]` is 2 (since `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]` and it repeats the 2 at the end), and `sum_values[10]` is `sum_total` which is 45 (since `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]` and `sum_total` is 45).

Thus, `sum_total` is recalculated as `values[11] + sum_values[10]`, which is `2 + 45`, resulting in `sum_total` being `47`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `47`, `i` is 11**.
