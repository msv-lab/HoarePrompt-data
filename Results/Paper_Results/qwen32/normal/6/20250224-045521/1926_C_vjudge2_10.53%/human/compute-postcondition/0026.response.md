The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` to the index `i` of the list `sum_values`. Given that `i` is 10 and `total` is `total + 10`, the 10th element of `sum_values` will be updated to this new value of `total`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 10 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to `total` and the 10th element set to `total + 10`, `total` is `total + 10`, `i` is 10.**
