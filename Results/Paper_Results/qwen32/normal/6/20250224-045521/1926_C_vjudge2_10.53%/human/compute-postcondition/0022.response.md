The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the current value of `total` to the `i`-th element of the `sum_values` list. Given that `i` is 9 and `total` has been increased by 9 from its previous value, the 9th element of `sum_values` will now hold this new value of `total`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 9 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`, `i` is 9, and `total` is now `total + 9`.**
