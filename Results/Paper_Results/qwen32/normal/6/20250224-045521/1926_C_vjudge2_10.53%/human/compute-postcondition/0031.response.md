The code snippet `remainder = int(word[:-1])` takes the string `word`, removes the last character, and converts the resulting substring back to an integer, which is then assigned to `remainder`.

Given that `word` is the string representation of `i`, and `last` is the last digit of `i`, the operation `word[:-1]` effectively removes the last digit from `word`, leaving the string representation of the number formed by the remaining digits of `i`.

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` (and hence `word`) has at least two digits. Therefore, `remainder` will be the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the last digit of `i`, `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed.**
