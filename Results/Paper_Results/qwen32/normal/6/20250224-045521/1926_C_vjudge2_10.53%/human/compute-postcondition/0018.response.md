The code snippet provided is `sum_values[i] = total`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers.
- `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `i` and all other elements initialized to 0.
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `total` is increased by the value of `i`.

The code assigns the current value of `total` to the `i`-th index of the `sum_values` list.

Since `total` is increased by the value of `i` before this assignment, we can infer that `total` is the cumulative sum of all `i` values encountered so far.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `i` and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`.**

In simpler terms, the `i`-th element of `sum_values` now holds the cumulative sum `total` up to this point, and `total` has been incremented by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
