The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9 (since it will be incremented to 10 at the start of the next iteration, which would terminate the loop).

Given the provided state, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `i` and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`, `i` is 9**
