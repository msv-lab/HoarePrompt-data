Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 47]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `47`, `i` is 11**.

After executing the code, the value at index `11` of the `sum_values` list is updated to `47`. All other variables remain unchanged.
