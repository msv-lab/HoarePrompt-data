### Reasoning:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to the maximum `n` across all test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and whether it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and stores these `n` values in a list called `numbers`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - It initializes two lists: `values` and `sum_values`.
     - `values[i]` will store the sum of the digits of the integer `i`.
     - `sum_values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the `values` from 1 to `i`.
   - It initializes the first 10 values in `values` and `sum_values` directly since these are single-digit numbers.

3. **Dynamic Programming to Compute Values**:
   - For each number `i` from 10 to the maximum `n`:
     - It calculates the last digit `last` and the remainder `remainder` when `i` is divided by 10.
     - It sets `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`.
     - It updates `sum_values[i]` to be the sum of `sum_values[i-1]` and `values[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each `n` in the list of test cases, it prints `sum_values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

- **Incorrect Loop Range in Precomputation**:
  - The loop for precomputing `values` and `sum_values` runs up to `n`, but `n` is not defined in this context. It should run up to `max(numbers)` to ensure all necessary values are precomputed.

- **Logic in Precomputation**:
  - The loop should iterate up to `max(numbers) + 1` to include the maximum `n` in the precomputation. The current loop will only go up to the last `n` read, which might not be the maximum `n` across all test cases.

### Corrected Loop Range:

```python
for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total
```

### Conclusion:

The logic in the program is correct, but there is a critical issue with the loop range in the precomputation phase. The loop should iterate up to `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure all necessary values are precomputed.

**Correctness: False**
