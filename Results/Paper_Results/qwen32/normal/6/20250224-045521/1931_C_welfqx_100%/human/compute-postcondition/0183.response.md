The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Given the initial state, `ck` is either 1 or 2. After the increment, `ck` will be either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `ck` is either 2 or 3.**
