To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `ii in range(n - 1)`. This means the only variables we can adjust are `ii` and `n`.

For the loop to execute, the range `(n - 1)` must be greater than 0. This implies that `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `ii` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

The state before the loop starts does not need to include `j` or `cn` since these are not part of the loop head and are mentioned in the context of the loop's behavior, not its execution condition.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The variable `ii` will be automatically set to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
