Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, up to `n-1` if all elements are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: f is 1, onum is the reversed copy of num, cn is 2 * n if symb1 is equal to symb2, otherwise cn remains n, symb1 is num[0], symb2 is onum[0], ii is n-1, ck is n, and symb1 is equal to symb2 if the if condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num` and is equal to `symb2`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 2`; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list; if `symb1` equals `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`; otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
