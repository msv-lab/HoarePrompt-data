In the given initial state, the variable `f` is set to 1, and `n` can be any value such that either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly provided or used in the print statement. The print statement is `print(0)`, which directly prints the integer `0` regardless of the values of `f` or `n`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply `0`.

Output: **0**
