The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, for the next iteration, `ii` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` will be a valid upper bound for `ii`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

Given that `ii` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if the loop is to execute again, `ii` should now be `ii + 1` from the end of the last iteration. The states of `ck` and `onum` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more precise in the state description, if `ii` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `ii` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `ii + 1`**.
