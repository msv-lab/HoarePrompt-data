The code snippet `ck = 1` directly assigns the value `1` to the variable `ck`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `ck` changes from its previous value (`n`) to `1`.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
