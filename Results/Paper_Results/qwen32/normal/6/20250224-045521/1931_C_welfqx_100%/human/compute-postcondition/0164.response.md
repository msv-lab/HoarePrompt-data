The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given the initial state, `cn` is either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `cn` will be either 2 or 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is either 2 or 3; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is `n - 1`**.
