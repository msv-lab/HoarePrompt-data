Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1`, `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `n`, `j`, `num`, and `f` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
