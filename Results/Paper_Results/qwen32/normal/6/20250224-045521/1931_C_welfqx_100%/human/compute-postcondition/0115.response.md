The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of the variable `ck` by 1. Since `ck` was not mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that `ck` must have been initialized to some value before this code snippet was executed. However, since the initial value of `ck` is not provided, we can only state that `ck` has been incremented by 1.

The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `cn`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `n`, `ii`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ii` is 1, `ck` is incremented by 1.**
