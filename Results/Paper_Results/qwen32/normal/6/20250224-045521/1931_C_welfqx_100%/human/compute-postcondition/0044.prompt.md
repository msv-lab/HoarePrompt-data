Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value where the loop broke, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `j` is `i` (where the loop broke), `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 0. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, the loop does not break and `cn` is set to 2. Otherwise, the loop breaks and `cn` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking and `cn` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `j` is `i` (where the loop broke) and `cn` is 1. The loop breaks at `i = 1` if `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking and `cn` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `j` is `i` (where the loop broke) and `cn` is 2. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, the loop breaks at `i = 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
