Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all the variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
