Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `f` or the loop continues.**
