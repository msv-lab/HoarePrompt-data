Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, and `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and the condition regarding `onum[ii]` and `onum[ii + 1]` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
