The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure `ii < n - 1`.

State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ii` is 2**
