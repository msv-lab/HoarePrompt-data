The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which increments the value of `cn` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `cn` can either be 1 or 2 based on the condition `If num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], the loop does not break and cn is set to 2. Otherwise, the loop breaks and cn remains 1.`

If `cn` was 1, it will become 2 after the operation.
If `cn` was 2, it will become 3 after the operation.

Since the values of other variables are not affected by this operation, we only need to update `cn` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `j` is `i` (where the loop broke), `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is either 2 or 3, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 1.**
