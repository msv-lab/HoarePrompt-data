The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is the current element being iterated over from the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust `ele` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer
- `c` and `maxi` are updated based on the value of `ele` in the previous iteration

For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` should be the next element in the list `l`. If the previous `ele` was the last element in the list, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration.

Let's assume that the current `ele` is the `i`-th element in the list `l`. After the current iteration, `ele` should be the `(i+1)`-th element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**
