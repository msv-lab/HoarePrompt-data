Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous value of `maxi` and `c`.**
