To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `c` is 0.
- `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is defined as the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.
   - If `l` is an empty list, the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray would be undefined, but the problem states `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and that value, so `maxi` would be 0.
   - If `l` contains elements, `maxi` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `l`.

2. **Value of `sum(l)`**:
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

3. **Value of `2 ** k`**:
   - `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `2 ** k`. However, we can express the final result in terms of `k`.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - Factoring out `maxi`, this becomes `((2 ** k - 1) * maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the values of `maxi` (which depends on the list `l`) and `k` (which is not specified). However, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **((2 ** k - 1) * maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where maxi is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`, and k is an unspecified integer)**
