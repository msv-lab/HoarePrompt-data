The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, and `c` is updated to be `c + ele`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is updated to be `c + ele`.**
