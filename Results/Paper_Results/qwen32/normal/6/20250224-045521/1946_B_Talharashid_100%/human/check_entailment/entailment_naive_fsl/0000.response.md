Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) and then uses this to calculate the final sum. However, the logic for calculating the maximum subarray sum is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray sum can be increased by including more elements or by considering different subarrays.

2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate the final sum, `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, is incorrect. The idea is to maximize the sum of the array by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum. However, the formula does not correctly account for the number of times the maximum subarray sum can be added.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The program does not correctly handle cases where all numbers in the array are negative. The maximum subarray sum in such cases should be `0` (by choosing an empty subarray), but the program might incorrectly calculate a negative value.

4. **Handling Large Values**: The program does not correctly handle large values of `k`. The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` can lead to incorrect results due to integer overflow or incorrect logic.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```

**Expected Output**:
```
96
```

**Explanation of Expected Output**:
- The maximum subarray sum is `12` (the entire array).
- After 3 operations, we can add the sum of the entire array three times, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]`.
- The sum of this array is `96`.

**Program Output**:
The program will likely output an incorrect value due to the flawed logic and formula.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
