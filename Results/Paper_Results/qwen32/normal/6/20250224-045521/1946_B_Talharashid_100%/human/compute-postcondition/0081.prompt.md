Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element. If the current element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is set to `'ele'` and `maxi` is set to `'ele'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` is `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. In both cases, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `k` remains the second integer from the input, and `l` remains a list of integers from the input with at least 3 elements, where `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
