Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset).
- `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.
- The print statement is: `print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)`

### Variables and Their Values:
1. **`c`**: This variable holds the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in the list `l`. If the last element of `l` is negative, `c` would be reset to 0.
2. **`maxi`**: This variable holds the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`.
3. **`k`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. We need to assume it is defined somewhere in the code. For the purpose of this explanation, we will assume `k` is a given integer value.
4. **`l`**: This is the list of integers, but its exact contents are not provided. We need to consider the sum of `l` which is `sum(l)`.

### Calculation Breakdown:
The print statement computes:
\[ (2^k \cdot \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \% 1000000007 \]

Breaking it down:
1. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This is `2` raised to the power of `k`, multiplied by `maxi`.
2. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This simplifies to `maxi * (2 ** k - 1)`.
3. **`maxi * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(l)`**: This is the result of the above expression plus the sum of all elements in `l`.
4. **`% 1000000007`**: The final result is taken modulo `1000000007`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression \((2^k \cdot \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \% 1000000007\).

Since the exact values of `k`, `maxi`, and `sum(l)` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is an integer, maxi is the maximum sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in l or a previously recorded maximum, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in l)**
