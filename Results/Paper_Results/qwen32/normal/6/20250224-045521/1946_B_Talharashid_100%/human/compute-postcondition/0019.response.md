The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, which is the current element being iterated over in the list `l`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer
- `ele` is the next element in the list `l`
- If `ele` < 0 and `c` ≤ abs(`ele`), `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.

After the previous iteration, `ele` has been processed, and we need to move to the next element in the list `l`. Therefore, `ele` should be updated to the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.

Since we don't have the specific values of `c` and `maxi` after the previous iteration, we cannot adjust them. The only variable we can adjust according to the loop head is `ele`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
