The code snippet provided is `maxi = max(c, maxi)`. This line updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. 

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` are all provided and `maxi` is not mentioned, we can infer that `maxi` must have been defined or initialized before this line of code. The value of `c` is also not mentioned in the initial state, so we need to consider `c` as an input or a previously defined variable.

Since `maxi` is being updated to the maximum of `c` and its previous value, the only change in the output state is the value of `maxi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
