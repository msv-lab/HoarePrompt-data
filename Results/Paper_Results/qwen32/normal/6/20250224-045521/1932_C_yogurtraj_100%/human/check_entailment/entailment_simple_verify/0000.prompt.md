You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly process the commands and compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` as described in the problem statement. There are multiple issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is initialized based on the last command in the string `t`. However, the problem requires the product of all elements to be calculated before each command is processed.
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are incorrectly initialized and used, leading to incorrect element multiplications.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the commands to the beginning, which is not required. The problem states that commands should be processed from left to right.
   - The logic for updating the product `k` and the indices `q1` and `q2` is incorrect. The product should be updated based on the command being processed, not the previous commands.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array has only one element or when all elements are `1`.
   - It does not correctly handle cases where the commands are all 'L' or all 'R'.

Here is a corrected version of the program that processes each command from left to right and correctly computes the required product remainders:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        left_index = 0
        right_index = n - 1
        
        for command in t:
            result.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left_index], m - 2, m)) % m
                left_index += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right_index], m - 2, m)) % m
                right_index -= 1
        
        print(*result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The product of all elements is calculated initially.
- For each command, the product is updated by removing the appropriate element using modular multiplicative inverse (computed using Fermat's Little Theorem).
- The commands are processed from left to right, and the results are stored and printed accordingly.
