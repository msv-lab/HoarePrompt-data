Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `(k * a[l + 1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 2`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and the current character of `t` at index `i` is 'R'**

Explanation: The value of `q2` is incremented by 1, so `q2` becomes `l + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
