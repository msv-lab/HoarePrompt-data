Let's analyze the given for loop and the state provided before the loop starts.

The loop is:
```python
for ii in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state before the loop starts is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The loop iterates `int(input())` times. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The variable `ii` is the loop variable and it ranges from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

In this context, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`. Since `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `int(input())` returns `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` returns `t`**
