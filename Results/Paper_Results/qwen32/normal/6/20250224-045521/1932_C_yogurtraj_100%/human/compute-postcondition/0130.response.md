Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `t` of length `n` containing 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `y` of length `n` based on the values in `a` and the directions in `t`, and prints the list `y`.**
