The provided code snippet reads input values and assigns them to `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `m` will be updated to the integer values provided by the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`: The input string, unchanged. `n`: The first integer from the input, `m`: The second integer from the input, `a`: The list of integers, unchanged. `l`: The number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, unchanged. `k`: The final value of `k` after the last iteration of the loop, unchanged. `q1` and `q2`: The final values of `q1` and `q2` after the last iteration of the loop, unchanged. `y`: The list `y` with `n` elements where each element from index `0` to `n-2` is the value of `k` calculated in each iteration, and the last element (index `n-1`) is the initial value of `k`, unchanged. `ii`: The loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, unchanged.**
