Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a string (the input value), `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a string (the input value), `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is updated based on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly, and `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`. Specifically, `y[i]` is now `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a string (the input value), `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`. Specifically, `y[i]` is now `k`. `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1. `q2` is adjusted accordingly in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a string (the input value); `n` is an integer that must be at least 1; `m` is the second integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`; `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k` and the `i`-th element also being `k`; `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
