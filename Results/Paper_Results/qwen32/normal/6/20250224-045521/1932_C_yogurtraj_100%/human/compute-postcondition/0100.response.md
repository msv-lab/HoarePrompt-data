Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from `n-2` to `0` has been updated to the corresponding value of `k` after all iterations, `ii` is `ii + 1`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.**
