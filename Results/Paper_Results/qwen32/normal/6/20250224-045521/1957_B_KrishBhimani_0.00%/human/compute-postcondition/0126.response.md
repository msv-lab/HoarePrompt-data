The only state in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`.
- `k` is an integer with at least one set bit.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`.
- `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`.
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k` plus one.
- `c` is incremented by 1 and `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`.

Since `i` is the loop variable and it currently holds the value of the last element processed from `arr`, we need to set `i` to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the `j`-th element of `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` should be set to the `(j+1)`-th element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `arr[j]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `arr[j+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`**

Since we don't know the exact index `j` of the current `i` in `arr`, we can just say that `i` is the next element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`**
