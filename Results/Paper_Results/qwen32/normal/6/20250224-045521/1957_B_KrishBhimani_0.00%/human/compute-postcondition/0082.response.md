Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 1. If `c` was less than `n - 1`, `ans` is `[1 << i]`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i)]`.**
