To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve. Let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
   - `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k`, which is 0 because `k` is 0.
   - `arr` contains the indices where the bits of the original `k` were 1, which is an empty list `[]`.
   - `ans` is `[]`.
   - `c` is 0.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop iterates over `arr`, which initially is empty. However, based on the provided output states, it seems `arr` is populated with indices of bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k`. Given `k` is initially 0, we infer that `arr` is populated with indices based on some external logic not shown in the snippet.
   - For each index `i` in `arr`:
     - If `c == n - 1`, append `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and break the loop.
     - Otherwise, increment `c` by 1 and append `1 << i` to `ans`.

### Output States Analysis:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `arr` must have at least one element, say `[0]`.
  - `ans` is `[1 << 0] = [1]` if `c < n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << 0]` if `c == n - 1`.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `arr` must have at least two elements, say `[0, 1]`.
  - `ans` is `[1 << 0, 1 << 1] = [1, 2]` if `c < n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << 0, -(1 << 0), 1 << 1]` if `c == n - 1`.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `arr` must have at least three elements, say `[0, 1, 2]`.
  - `ans` is `[1 << 0, 1 << 1, 1 << 2] = [1, 2, 4]` if `c < n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << 0, -(1 << 0), 1 << 1, -(1 << 1), 1 << 2]` if `c == n - 1`.

### General Pattern:
- The loop continues to append `1 << i` to `ans` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`.
- When `c` reaches `n - 1`, it appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute until `c` reaches `n - 1`.
- At that point, `ans` will contain `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1]]`.
- The last element appended to `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.

### Conclusion:
Assuming `arr` has `n` elements, the final state of `ans` will be `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` contains the indices where the bits of some number (not necessarily `k`) were 1, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`.**

In simple terms, the final output state includes the list `ans` that contains powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in `arr`, followed by the value `k0` minus the sum of these powers of 2.
