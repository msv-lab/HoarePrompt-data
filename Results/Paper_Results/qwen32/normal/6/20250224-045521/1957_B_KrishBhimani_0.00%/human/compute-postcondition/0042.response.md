The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless `c` reaches `n - 1`, in which case `ans` is updated and a break occurs. However, the code provided does not include any conditional checks or loops that would cause a break, so we will only consider the increment of `c`.

Given that `c` is initially `c + 1` from the initial state, and we increment it by 1, the new value of `c` will be `c + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 2`, and `ans` is [2, -1, 2].**
