The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr` will have 1 appended to it.

Let's break it down:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` remains the integer value of `k0 // 2` and `k` must be non-zero.
- `k0` remains equal to `k0`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `arr` was initially either an empty list (if `k0` is even) or a list containing the integer 0 (if `k0` is odd). After appending `i` (which is 1), `arr` will be `[1]` if it was initially empty, or `[0, 1]` if it initially contained the integer 0.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 2` and `k` must be non-zero; `k0` is equal to `k0`; `i` is 1; `arr` is either `[1]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether `k0` was even or odd.**
