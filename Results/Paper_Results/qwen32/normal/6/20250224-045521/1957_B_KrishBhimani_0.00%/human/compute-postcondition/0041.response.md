Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, and `ans` is [2, -1, 2]. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to [2, -1, 2, -2] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**
