Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 1.**
