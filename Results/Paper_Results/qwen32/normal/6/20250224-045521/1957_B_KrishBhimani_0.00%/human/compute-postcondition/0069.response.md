To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop works and the state changes with each iteration.

The loop runs while `k` is not zero. In each iteration:
1. If `k` is odd (`k & 1 == 1`), the current value of `i` is appended to `arr`.
2. `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`), which is equivalent to integer division by 2.
3. `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop will continue until `k` becomes 0. The number of iterations is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.

Let's analyze the changes in the variables:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `l1` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` starts with a value and becomes 0 after the loop.
- `k0` remains unchanged.
- `i` becomes the number of iterations, which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `arr` contains the indices where the bits of `k` were 1, in the order they were encountered.

To determine the final state of `arr`, we need to know the binary representation of the original `k`. The binary representation determines which bits are 1 and thus which indices are appended to `arr`.

Since `k` is right-shifted in each iteration until it becomes 0, the number of iterations is the number of bits in `k`. The final value of `i` will be this number of bits.

For example, if `k` was 13 (binary `1101`), the loop would run 4 times, appending `i` to `arr` when `k` is odd:
- First iteration: `k = 13` (odd), append `0` to `arr` → `arr = [0]`, `k = 6`, `i = 1`
- Second iteration: `k = 6` (even), do not append, `k = 3`, `i = 2`
- Third iteration: `k = 3` (odd), append `2` to `arr` → `arr = [0, 2]`, `k = 1`, `i = 3`
- Fourth iteration: `k = 1` (odd), append `3` to `arr` → `arr = [0, 2, 3]`, `k = 0`, `i = 4`

The final state of the variables is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k`.
- `arr` contains the indices where the bits of the original `k` were 1.
- `ans` is [2, -2].
- `c` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k`, `arr` contains the indices where the bits of the original `k` were 1, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**
