The provided code snippet takes the first two elements of the list `l1`, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
