Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [k0], `c` is equal to `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
