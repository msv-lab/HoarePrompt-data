The given code snippet increments the value at index `i` in the `freq` list by 1. The initial state specifies that `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`. The value at `freq[i]` will be incremented by 1, while all other elements in `freq` and the `arr` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, and `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except `freq[i]` which is now 1.**
