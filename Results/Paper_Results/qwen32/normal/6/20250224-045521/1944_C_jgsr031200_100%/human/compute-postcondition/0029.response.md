Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `cou` is either 0 or 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
