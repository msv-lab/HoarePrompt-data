Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, and `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except each `freq[j]` reflects the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0.**

In simple terms, the initial state of `arr` and `freq` remains unchanged, and a new variable `cou` is introduced with a value of 0.
