Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `cou` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `freq[i]` is equal to 1, then `cou` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`. If `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
