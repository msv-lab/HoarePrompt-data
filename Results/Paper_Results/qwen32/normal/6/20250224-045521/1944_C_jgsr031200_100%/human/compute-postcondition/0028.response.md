The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range `n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables `arr`, `freq`, and `cou` are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `cou` is either 0 or 1 or 2**
