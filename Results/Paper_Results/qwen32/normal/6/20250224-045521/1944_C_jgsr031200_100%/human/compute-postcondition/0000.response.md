Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of arr is n where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of elements across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of n + 1.**

This means that a new list `freq` has been created and initialized with `n + 1` zeros. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
