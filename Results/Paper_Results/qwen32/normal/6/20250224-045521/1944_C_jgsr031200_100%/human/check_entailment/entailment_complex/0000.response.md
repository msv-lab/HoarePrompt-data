### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**: It then iterates over the input array `arr` and updates the `freq` array to reflect the count of each number.

3. **Finding MEX**: The code iterates over the `freq` array to find the smallest index `i` where `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1. If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is missing from `arr`, and if `freq[i]` is 1, it means `i` appears exactly once in `arr`. The game's score is the smallest such `i`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, the provided code correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either missing or appears exactly once in `arr`, which is the optimal score for the game when both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game, considering the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
