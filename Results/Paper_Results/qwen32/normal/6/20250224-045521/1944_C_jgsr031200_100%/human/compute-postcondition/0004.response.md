The code increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Given that `freq[i]` was initially 1, it will now be 2. All other elements in `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged. The length of `arr` is `n`, and `freq` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, and `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except `freq[i]` which is now 2.**
