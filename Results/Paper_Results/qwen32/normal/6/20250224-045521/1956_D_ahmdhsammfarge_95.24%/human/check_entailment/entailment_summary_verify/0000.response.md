### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code. Let's break down the problems systematically:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to find the best subarray to replace with its MEX value. However, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates a sum based on some arbitrary formula (`sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`) and tries to maximize it. This is not what the problem requires.
   - The MEX of a subarray should be calculated to determine the smallest non-negative integer not present in that subarray. The current logic does not do this.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function seems to be recursively adding operations, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that the operations are maximizing the sum of the array.
   - The function does not seem to contribute to the correct implementation of the MEX operation or the strategy to maximize the array sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to replace the subarray with its MEX value, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and instead replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray (`n = l - r + 1`), which is not the correct approach.
   - The function summary correctly states that the function sets all elements in the range from index `r` to `l` to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the range. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Compute the MEX of the entire array.
2. Replace subarrays with their MEX values to maximize the sum.
3. Ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided code does not produce this output. Instead, it will likely produce an incorrect sequence of operations and an incorrect maximum sum because it does not correctly compute and apply the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
