Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 2 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2.**
