You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation that sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The operation can be performed up to 500,000 times.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- This function is supposed to find the subarray `[i, j]` that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum `sm` if the subarray `[i, j]` is set to its MEX. However, the calculation of `sm` is incorrect. The MEX value is not used; instead, the sum is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula does not represent the correct sum after setting the subarray to its MEX.
- The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that results in the maximum sum according to the incorrect formula.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- This function is supposed to generate operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- It recursively calls itself with the subarray `[r, l-1]` and adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- However, the logic for generating operations is not correct and does not necessarily achieve the goal of setting the subarray to its MEX value.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- This function sets the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and generates the corresponding operations.
- It adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and then calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
- The subarray is set to the length of the subarray `n` instead of the MEX value, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any subarray and does not generate the correct operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic in each function is flawed, and the program does not achieve the desired result.
