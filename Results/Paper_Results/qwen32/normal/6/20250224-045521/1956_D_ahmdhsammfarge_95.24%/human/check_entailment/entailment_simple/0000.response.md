### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to understand if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- We can perform an operation where we choose a subarray from index `l` to `r`, compute its MEX, and set all elements in this subarray to this MEX.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing the operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop in the program uses `func_1` to find the subarray `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum if we were to replace it with its MEX.
   - It then calls `func_3` to perform the operation and update the array.
   - This loop continues until no further beneficial subarray can be found (`r == l`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible subarrays to find the one that maximizes the sum after replacing it with its MEX.
   - The MEX is not explicitly computed here; instead, the sum of the array with the subarray replaced by `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is computed.
   - This is a heuristic approach to find a potentially beneficial subarray.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is recursively called to perform a series of operations to set all elements in the subarray `[r, l]` to the same value.
   - It is not clear how this function contributes to the correctness of the solution, as it seems to perform redundant operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function performs the main operation of replacing the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX.
   - It also calls `func_2` and performs additional operations that seem unnecessary for the problem.

5. **Post-Processing**:
   - The program attempts to replace any remaining `0`s in the array with `1`s, which is a valid operation to increase the sum.
   - However, this step is not guaranteed to be optimal or necessary.

#### Issues and Limitations:
- The main issue with the program is the heuristic approach in `func_1`. It does not guarantee finding the optimal subarray to replace with its MEX.
- The recursive nature of `func_2` and the additional operations in `func_3` seem unnecessary and could lead to suboptimal solutions or excessive operations.
- The post-processing step of replacing `0`s with `1`s is a valid operation but may not be sufficient to achieve the maximum sum in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee finding the optimal solution to maximize the sum of the array. It uses heuristics and performs unnecessary operations, which may lead to suboptimal results.

**Correctness: False**
