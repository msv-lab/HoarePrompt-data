### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to see if they collectively meet the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the subarray `[i, j]` such that the sum of the elements outside this subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray is maximized.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and checks the condition, which is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function appends operations to the `ops` list in a recursive manner. It seems to be designed to cover all subarrays between `r` and `l` by repeatedly appending operations.
   - However, the exact purpose of this function in the context of maximizing the sum is not immediately clear from the problem statement or the function's behavior. It could be a helper function to ensure all possible subarrays are considered, but its logic is not directly tied to maximizing the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function appends operations to the `ops` list and modifies the list `lst` by setting all elements in the range `[r, l]` to the length of this range, `n`.
   - It calls `func_2` which, as mentioned, appends operations in a recursive manner.
   - The function modifies the list to maximize the sum by setting the subarray to its MEX value, which is the length of the subarray in this case.

4. **Main Code Logic**:
   - The main code initializes the list `lst` and an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - It then repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the subarray `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum condition.
   - If `r` is not equal to `l`, it calls `func_3` to modify the list and append operations.
   - After the main loop, it tries to find any zeros in the list and replaces them with 1, appending the corresponding operations.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the list and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

### Issues and Concerns:
- The logic in `func_2` is not clearly tied to maximizing the sum. It seems to be redundant or incorrectly implemented.
- The main loop only modifies the list when `r` is not equal to `l`. If `r` equals `l`, it does not perform any operations, which might be a problem if the optimal solution involves single-element modifications.
- The replacement of zeros with 1 is a heuristic that might not always lead to the optimal solution, especially if there are better subarrays to modify.

### Conclusion:
While the functions attempt to follow the problem's logic, the implementation details, especially in `func_2`, seem unclear and possibly incorrect. The main loop and the zero-replacement heuristic might not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
