### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, focusing on the correctness of the functions and their logic.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - The function is supposed to find the subarray that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - It incorrectly calculates a new sum `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula does not represent the correct sum after setting the subarray to its MEX.
   - The MEX value is not computed, and instead, the function relies on an incorrect formula to determine the best subarray to modify.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is supposed to generate operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
   - The logic is flawed. It recursively calls itself and adds operations, but it does not correctly generate operations to achieve the goal of setting the subarray to its MEX value.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is supposed to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and generate the corresponding operations.
   - It adds operations and then calls `func_2`. However, it sets the subarray to the length of the subarray `n` instead of the MEX value, which is incorrect.

#### Evaluation:
- **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: None of the functions correctly compute the MEX value of any subarray.
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: `func_1` uses an incorrect formula to calculate the potential new sum after setting a subarray to its MEX.
- **Incorrect Operation Generation**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly reflect setting the subarray to its MEX value.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions do not calculate the MEX value, generate correct operations, or update the array in the desired manner. Therefore, the program does not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
