The code snippet `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Given that `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `over_sum` will now hold this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `j` is 1**.
