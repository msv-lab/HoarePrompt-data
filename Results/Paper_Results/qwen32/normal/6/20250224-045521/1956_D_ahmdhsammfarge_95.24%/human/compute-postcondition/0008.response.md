The provided Python code snippet modifies the list `lst` by replacing the slice from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a new list of `n` elements, where each element is the value `n`. The value of `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, which represents the length of the slice being replaced.

Here is the output state after the code execution:

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` has been modified such that the elements from index `r` to `l` are now all equal to `n`, `ops` is a list that includes the operations performed, including the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

In plain English, the list `lst` has been updated so that the elements from index `r` to `l` are all replaced by the value `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in the original slice. The other variables (`r`, `l`, `ops`, and `n`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and constraints.
