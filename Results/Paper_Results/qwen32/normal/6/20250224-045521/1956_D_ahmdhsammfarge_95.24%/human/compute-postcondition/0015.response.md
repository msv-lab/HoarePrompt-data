Initial State: 
- `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements
- `r` is 0
- `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0
- `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`
- `i` is 0
- `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`
- `j` is 2

The given code snippet is:
```
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `sum(lst[:i])` is `sum(lst[0:0])` which is 0, and `sum(lst[j + 1:])` is `sum(lst[3:])`. The term `(j - i + 1) ** 2` evaluates to `(2 - 0 + 1) ** 2` which is 9.

Thus, the new value of `sm` is `0 + sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2**.
