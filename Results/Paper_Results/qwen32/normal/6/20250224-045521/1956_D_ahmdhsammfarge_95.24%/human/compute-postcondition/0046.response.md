The code snippet updates the value of `sm` based on the new formula provided. The other variables (`r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `lst`) remain unchanged unless directly modified by the code. Here's the updated state of `sm`:

Output State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` are `[0, j]`. `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, provided `j + 1 < len(lst)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `sm` has been recalculated using the new formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. All other variables retain their previous values unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, in which case `over_sum` is updated to the new value of `sm`.
