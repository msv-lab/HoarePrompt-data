Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: To find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array if the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` is replaced by the MEX value of that subarray.
- **Logic**: It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum if the subarray `lst[i:j+1]` were replaced by `(j-i+1)**2`. The `(j-i+1)**2` represents the sum if the subarray is replaced by the MEX value, which in the worst case (when all numbers from `0` to `j-i` are present in the subarray) would be the square of the length of the subarray.
- **Issue**: The logic is incorrect because it does not actually calculate the MEX value but instead uses the square of the length of the subarray. This is not the correct way to find the MEX value, and the sum calculation is flawed.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To generate a sequence of operations that will set the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the MEX value.
- **Logic**: Recursively calls itself to generate operations that will eventually set the subarray to the MEX value. However, the logic is flawed as it does not correctly determine the MEX value and the operations it generates are not guaranteed to achieve the goal.
- **Issue**: The recursive approach does not correctly determine the MEX value and the operations generated do not necessarily maximize the sum of the array.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To perform the operations determined by `func_2` and update the list `lst` accordingly.
- **Logic**: Calls `func_2` to generate operations, then updates the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the length of the subarray `n`. However, this is not the correct way to maximize the sum of the array.
- **Issue**: The operations generated by `func_2` are incorrect, and the update to the subarray does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value of a subarray and to generate operations that maximize the sum of the array. The logic used in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is flawed, and the operations generated do not achieve the desired result.

### Correctness

Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
