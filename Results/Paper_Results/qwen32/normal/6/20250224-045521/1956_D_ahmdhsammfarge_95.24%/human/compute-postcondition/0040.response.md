The provided code snippet calculates a value for `sm` based on the current values of `i` and `j` (which is not defined in the initial state but is used in the code). Since `i` is given as 0, and `j` is not specified, we can only express `sm` in terms of `j`.

Given:
- `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`
- `i` is 0

Substituting `i` with 0, the equation becomes:
- `sm = sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1) ** 2`
- `sm = 0 + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2`

Since `sum(lst[:0])` is always 0, the value of `sm` is now dependent on `j` and the elements of `lst` starting from index `j + 1`.

No other variables are modified by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated value of `sm` and retain the initial values of `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `i`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` if `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged, `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2`.**
