The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged. Since `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4, and `sm` is greater than `over_sum` before the assignment, after the assignment, `over_sum` will have the value of `sm`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is `len(lst) - 2`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`.**
