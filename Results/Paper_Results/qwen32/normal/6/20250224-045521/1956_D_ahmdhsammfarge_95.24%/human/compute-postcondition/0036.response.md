Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` are both set to `[i, j]`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged.**
