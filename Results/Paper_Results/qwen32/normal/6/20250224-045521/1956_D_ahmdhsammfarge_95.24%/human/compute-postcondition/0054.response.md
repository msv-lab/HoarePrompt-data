Postcondition: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` is `i` and `l` is `j`. `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
