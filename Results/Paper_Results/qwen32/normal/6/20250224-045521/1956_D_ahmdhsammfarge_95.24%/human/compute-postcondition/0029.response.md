The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + 1`, `r` is `len(lst) - 2`, `l` is `len(lst)`**.
