The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the loop statement `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst))`, `j` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` is 0, `l` is `j`.
- `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `i` is 0.
- `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.

Since `i` is 0, `j` starts from `i + 1` which is 1. After the first iteration, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration, provided `j + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.

State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` is 0, `l` is `j`. `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `j` is 2**.
