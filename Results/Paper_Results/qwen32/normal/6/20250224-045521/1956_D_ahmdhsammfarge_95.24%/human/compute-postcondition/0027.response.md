To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `len(lst)`. According to the provided for loop statement:

```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `j` starts at `i + 1` and goes up to, but does not include, `len(lst)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(lst) - 2` and `j` is `len(lst) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `len(lst)`.

However, since `j` is already `len(lst) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `j` by 1 would make `j` equal to `len(lst)`, which means the loop condition `j in range(i + 1, len(lst))` would no longer be satisfied, and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time with the current state. But if we were to hypothetically consider the state just before the loop would terminate, we would have:

- `j` would be incremented by 1, making it `len(lst)`.
- `i` remains `len(lst) - 2` as it is not part of the loop head and does not change within the loop.
- `len(lst)` remains unchanged.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `len(lst) - 2` and `l` is set to `len(lst) - 1`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are not defined.**

Since `j` is now equal to `len(lst)`, the loop will not execute again.
