#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` is the sum of these integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the first input being the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` is the sum of these integers.

    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial n, n is 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n` as input and returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and returns this value minus one.
