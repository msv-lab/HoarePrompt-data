Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers and `k` is their sum. The function handles multiple test cases, with the first input being the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, if the conditions are not met (which is implied by the given outputs), the function returns -1.**
