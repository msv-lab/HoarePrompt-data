Precondition: **array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total sum of n values across all test cases not exceeding 2·10^5.**
