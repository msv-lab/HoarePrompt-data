The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of `r` and `mid` remain unchanged. The precondition that `l <= r` must still hold true after this update. Since `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, the new value of `l` will be `((l + r) // 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged, and `l <= r` holds true.**
