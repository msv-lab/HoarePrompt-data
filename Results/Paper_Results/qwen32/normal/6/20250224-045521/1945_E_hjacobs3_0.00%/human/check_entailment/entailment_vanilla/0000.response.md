Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:

1. We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
2. We can perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to arrange it such that after running a binary search, `p_l` (the element at the final `l` index of the binary search) is equal to `x`.
3. The binary search algorithm is defined as follows:
    - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`.
    - Repeat until `r - l = 1`:
        - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
        - If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`.
        - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
4. The goal is to rearrange the permutation such that after the binary search, `p_l` (the final `l` index) equals `x`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array` of size `n`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented in the `func_1` function.
   - The loop condition is `l <= r`, which is slightly different from the problem description's `r - l = 1`.
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct.
   - The logic for updating `l` and `r` is correct but reversed compared to the problem description. In the problem, `l` is updated to `m` when `p_m <= x`, and `r` is updated to `m` when `p_m > x`. In the program, `r` is updated to `mid - 1` when `p_m >= x`, and `l` is updated to `mid + 1` when `p_m < x`.

3. **Post-Binary Search Logic:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `x`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `l + 1` and the index of `x` + 1.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic in the program is incorrect. The loop should continue until `r - l = 1`, not `l <= r`.
   - The update of `l` and `r` should match the problem description.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program only considers one swap when `l` does not match the index of `x`. However, the problem allows for up to two swaps, and the program does not explore the possibility of using two swaps to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the binary search as described in the problem and does not utilize the possibility of two swaps to achieve the desired result.

**Correctness: False**
