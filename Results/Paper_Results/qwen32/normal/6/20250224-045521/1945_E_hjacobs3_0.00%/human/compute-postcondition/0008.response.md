Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the `array`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `l` is 0 and `r` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` and `r` is `n - 1`. `mid` remains `(n - 1) // 2` in both cases.**
