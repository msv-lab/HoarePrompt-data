Output State: **`l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` as described in the code, ensuring `l <= r` holds true; `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2; r` is `mid - 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. The values of `l` and `mid` remain unchanged, and the condition `l <= r` still holds true.
