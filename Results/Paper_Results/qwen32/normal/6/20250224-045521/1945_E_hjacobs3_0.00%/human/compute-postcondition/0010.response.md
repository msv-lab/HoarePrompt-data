Output State: **`l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` as described in the code, ensuring `l <= r` holds true; `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `mid` is now set to the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The values of `l` and `r` remain as they were, but `mid` holds the new calculated value. The condition that `l` should be less than or equal to `r` is still valid.
