Output State: **The program returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of `array.index(find) + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list with two string values. The first value is one more than the smallest index `l` where the element in `array` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n + 1` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. The second value is one more than the index of `find` in `array`.
