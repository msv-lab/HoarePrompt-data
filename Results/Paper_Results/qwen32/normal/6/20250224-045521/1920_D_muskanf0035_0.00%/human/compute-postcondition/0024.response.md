Output State: **The program returns `result`, which is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list `result` that holds specific elements from `array`. Each element in `result` corresponds to the element in `array` at the index determined by `(k - 1) % len(array)`, where `k` is an element from the original `queries` list.
