The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q`. This means that the value of `n` will be the first input integer, and the value of `q` will be the second input integer. The other variables (`operations`, `queries`, `t`, `result`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
