The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with b being either 1 or 2 and x being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the queries; `t` must be greater than 0**
