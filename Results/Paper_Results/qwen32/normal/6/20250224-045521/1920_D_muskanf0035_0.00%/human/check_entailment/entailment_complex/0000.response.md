### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function performs the operations on the array and answers the queries.
   - **Operations Handling**:
     - When `op_type` is `1`, it appends `value` to the array.
     - When `op_type` is `2`, it extends the array by appending `x` copies of itself. However, the implementation provided does not correctly handle this operation. Instead of appending `x` copies, it only appends the current array once (`array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`).
     - The correct implementation for operation `2` should be to extend the array by appending itself `x` times, which can be done with `array *= x` or a similar approach.
   - **Query Handling**: It correctly handles the queries by returning the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries.
   - **Processing**: It calls `func_1` with the operations and queries for each test case.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The main issue in the code lies in the handling of operation type `2` in `func_1`. The current implementation does not correctly append the array `x` times as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue with operation type `2`, the program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly perform the operations as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
