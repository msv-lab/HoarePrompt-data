Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Initial State**: We start with an empty array `a`.
2. **Operations**:
    - **Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
    - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`. This means the size of the array will increase significantly.
3. **Queries**: For each query, we need to return the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

### Key Points

- **Operation Type 2**: When performing an operation of type 2, the array can grow exponentially. This means that storing the entire array in memory might be infeasible for large `x`.
- **Queries**: The queries require finding the `k`-th element of the final array, which might be extremely large.

### Solution Analysis

Let's look at the provided solution:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

#### Issues with the Solution

1. **Exponential Growth**: The solution uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to handle operation type 2. This approach is inefficient for large `x` because it creates a new list that is `x` times the size of the current array and extends the original array with this new list. This will lead to excessive memory usage and slow execution time for large `x`.

2. **Query Handling**: The solution calculates the `k`-th element by using modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This approach is correct in terms of logic but only works if the entire array is stored in memory, which is not feasible due to the exponential growth of the array.

### Correctness

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution is not correct because it does not handle the exponential growth of the array efficiently. It will run out of memory or take too long to execute for large `x`.

#### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to its inefficient handling of the exponential growth of the array during operation type 2 and the fact that it attempts to store the entire array in memory, which is not feasible for large inputs.
