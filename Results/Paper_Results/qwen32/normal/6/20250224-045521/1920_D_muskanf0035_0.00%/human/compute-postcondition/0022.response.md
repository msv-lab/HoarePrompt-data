Output State: **`array` is the final list after all operations have been applied, `n` remains the same, `operations` is empty, `queries` must have at least one element, `result` is a list containing three elements, the first two are `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` and the third is also `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, and `k` is the first element in `queries`.**

In simple terms, the `result` list now contains three identical elements, each being the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
