Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `op_type` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `value`; and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array. The function performs a series of operations on an array and then returns a list of elements from the array based on the positions specified in `queries`. Each element in the result list corresponds to the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list.**
