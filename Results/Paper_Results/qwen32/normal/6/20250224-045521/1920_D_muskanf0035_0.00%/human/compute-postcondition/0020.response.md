Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations. `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x`, with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer. `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the queries. The function processes the operations and then uses the results to answer the queries. For each query, the function returns a value based on the processed operations.**
