t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. operations is a list of n tuples, where each tuple (b, x) consists of an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n if b=1, 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2). queries is a list of q integers, where each integer k_i satisfies 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), with c being the size of the array after all n operations. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.
