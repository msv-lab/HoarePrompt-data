The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to `n` and `q`. The values of `n` and `q` are updated based on the input, but the other variables (`operations`, `queries`, `t`, `result`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
