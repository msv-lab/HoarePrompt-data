You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer op_type (either 1 or 2) and an integer value, and queries is a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `array` is the final list after all operations have been applied, `n` remains the same, `operations` is empty, `queries` remains the same, and `result` remains an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `array` is the final list after all operations have been applied, `n` remains the same, `operations` is empty, `queries` is empty, and `result` is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
    return result
    #The program returns `result`, which is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `op_type` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `value`; and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array. The function performs a series of operations on an array and then returns a list of elements from the array based on the positions specified in `queries`. Each element in the result list corresponds to the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `result`, which is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
