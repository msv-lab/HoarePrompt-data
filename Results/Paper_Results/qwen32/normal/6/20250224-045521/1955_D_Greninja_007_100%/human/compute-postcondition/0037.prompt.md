Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the frequency of `a[r]` increased by 1 and the frequency of `a[r - m]` decreased by 1; `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the frequency of `a[r]` increased by 1 and the frequency of `a[r - m]` decreased by 1; `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 2. `r` is m + 1; the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the frequency of `a[r]` increased by 1 and the frequency of `a[r - m]` decreased by 1; `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 2. `r` is m + 2; the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is increased by 1. If `ca[a[r]] <= cb[a[r]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1. The frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
