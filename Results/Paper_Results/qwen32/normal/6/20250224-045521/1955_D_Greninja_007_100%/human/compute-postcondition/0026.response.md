Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the frequency of `a[r]` increased by 1 and the frequency of `a[r - m]` decreased by 1; `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 2; `r` is m + 1; the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
