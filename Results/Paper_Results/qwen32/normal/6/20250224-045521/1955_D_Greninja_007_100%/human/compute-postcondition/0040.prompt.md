You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[n-m:n]`; `ans` is the number of windows of `m` consecutive elements in `a` where the count of elements in `ca` that have a frequency less than or equal to their frequency in `cb` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the number of windows of `m` consecutive elements in `a` where the count of elements in `ca` that have a frequency less than or equal to their frequency in `cb` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a`), `m` (the length of list `b` and the size of the window in `a`), `k` (the minimum count of elements in the window that meet the frequency condition), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `b` (a list of `m` integers). It returns `ans`, which is the number of windows of `m` consecutive elements in `a` where the count of elements that have a frequency less than or equal to their frequency in `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `ans`, which is the number of windows of `m` consecutive elements in `a` where the count of elements in `ca` that have a frequency less than or equal to their frequency in `cb` is greater than or equal to `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
