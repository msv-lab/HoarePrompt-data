### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then selecting the smallest prices to minimize the total cost, while also considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day. However, the implementation seems to have logical errors and does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The code sorts the list of ticket prices and selects the smallest `q` prices, where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets on subsequent days. The cost of tickets increases after each purchase, so the cheapest tickets available on the first day might not necessarily be the cheapest in terms of total cost over multiple days.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation formula used in the code does not correctly account for the incremental increase in ticket prices after each purchase. The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and the additional terms do not properly reflect the problem's constraints.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, the code does not properly calculate the cost for the remaining tickets after purchasing in full `m`-sized batches.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The code does not produce the correct output for the provided example test cases. For instance, in the first test case, the expected output is `10`, but the code's logic would not yield this result.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
