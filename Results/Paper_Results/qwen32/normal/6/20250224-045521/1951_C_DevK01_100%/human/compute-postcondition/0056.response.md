The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables outside of the loop or the conditions that have been set up before the loop. Since the provided code snippet does not contain any loop and the `continue` statement is used outside of any loop, it does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `len(M[:q-1])`, `N` is `M[:q-1]`, `w` is `M[q-1]`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
