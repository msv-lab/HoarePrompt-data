The code `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `N`. Since `N` is `M[:q]`, the last element of `N` is `M[q-1]`. After the operation, `N` will have one less element, specifically `N` will be `M[:q-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`.**
