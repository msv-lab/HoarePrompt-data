The given code snippet calculates the value of `mu` based on the existing values of `k`, `n`, and `m`. The initial state provides the necessary context for these variables:

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string
- `n` is `len(N)`
- `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`
- `k` is `L[2]`
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`
- `N` is `M[:q-1]`
- `w` is `M[q-1]`

The code snippet is:
```
mu = k - (n - 1) * m
```

After executing this line, `mu` is assigned the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that all the initial variables remain the same except for the addition of the new variable `mu`, which is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
