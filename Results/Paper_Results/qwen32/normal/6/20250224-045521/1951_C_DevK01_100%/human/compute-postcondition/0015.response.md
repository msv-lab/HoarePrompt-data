The given Python code snippet calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `mu * w`. The variables `mu` and `w` are already defined in the initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M` after removing the last element, and `w` is the last element that was removed from `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
