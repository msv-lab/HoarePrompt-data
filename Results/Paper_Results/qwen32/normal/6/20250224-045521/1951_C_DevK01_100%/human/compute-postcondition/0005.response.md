The code snippet `m = min(m, k)` updates the value of `m` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `k`. Therefore, the new value of `m` will be the smaller of the two values it was compared against.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a list of integers read from the input.**
