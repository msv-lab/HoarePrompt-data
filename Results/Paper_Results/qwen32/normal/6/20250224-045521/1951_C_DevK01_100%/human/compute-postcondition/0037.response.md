To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully follow the steps and calculations described in the initial state.

1. **Inputs and Initial Calculations:**
   - `t` is an input integer that has been decremented by 1.
   - `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from another input line.
   - `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L` (i.e., `min(L[1], L[2])`).
   - `k` is the third element of `L` (i.e., `L[2]`).
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` (i.e., `int(math.ceil(k / m))`).

2. **Determine `N` and `cost`:**
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is `q - 1`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Let's break down the calculation of `cost`:

- **Case 1: `n * m == k`**
  - `n` would be `q` (since `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` and if `n * m == k`, `n` must be `q`).
  - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 1) * q // 2)`.

- **Case 2: `n * m != k`**
  - `n` is `q - 1`.
  - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of the original `N` (which is the `q`-th element of `M`).
  - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, which simplifies to `k - (q - 2) * m`.
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu`.

Since the specific values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cost`.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the given formulas and the values of L and M)**
