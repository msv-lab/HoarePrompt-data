Let's break down the given initial state and the computation of the `cost` variable step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An input integer greater than 0 (not directly used in the cost calculation).
- `L`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `M`: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `k`: The second element of the list `L`, i.e., `L[2]`.
- `m`: The minimum of the second and third elements of the list `L`, i.e., `min(L[1], L[2])`.
- `q`: The ceiling of `k / m`, i.e., `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `n`: The length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q-1`.
- `N`: The first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element.
- `w`: The last element that was removed from `N` if `n * m != k`.
- `mu`: `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.
- `cost`: 
  - If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
  - If `n * m != k`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is the second element of the list `L`, i.e., `L[2]`.

2. **Determine `m`**:
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, i.e., `min(L[1], L[2])`.

3. **Determine `q`**:
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, i.e., `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.

4. **Determine `n`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is `q-1`.

5. **Determine `N`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element.

6. **Determine `w`**:
   - `w` is the last element that was removed from `N` if `n * m != k`.

7. **Determine `mu`**:
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.

8. **Determine `cost`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Output Description:
The `print(cost)` statement will output the calculated cost based on the conditions described above. The exact numerical value of `cost` depends on the input values of `L` and `M`.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and input values of L and M)**
