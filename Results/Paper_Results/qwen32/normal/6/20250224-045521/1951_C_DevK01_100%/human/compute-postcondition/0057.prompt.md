Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5; `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `k` is an integer between 1 and min(nm, 10^9); the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q-1`. `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element, and `w` is the last element that was removed from `N` if `n * m != k`. `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`. `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line; `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `q - 1`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `len(M[:q-1])`, `N` is `M[:q-1]`, `w` is `M[q-1]`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
