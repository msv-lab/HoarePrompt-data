You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is the sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding `n` and `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The condition for a valid pair (a, b) is that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided program attempts to count such pairs but uses an incorrect approach. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`**:
   - `count` is initialized to 2, which skips the case where `b = 1`. This is incorrect because pairs like (a, 1) should be counted.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The initial count should be 0, and then pairs (a, 1) should be counted separately.

2. **Loop logic**:
   - The loop increments `count` and calculates `g` as `n / count`, but it does not correctly handle the gcd condition.
   - The condition `if g < countmins: break` is not appropriate for this problem.
   - The calculation `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

3. **Handling of `b = 1`**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `b = 1`. For any `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair (a, 1) is valid because `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1 * gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and for each `b`, iterate over possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` to check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. This approach would be computationally expensive for large values of `n` and `m`, so optimizations are necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly counts the valid pairs:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version checks each pair (a, b) and counts it if it satisfies the condition. However, for large inputs, this approach would be too slow, and further optimizations would be required. But the logic is correct for counting valid pairs.
