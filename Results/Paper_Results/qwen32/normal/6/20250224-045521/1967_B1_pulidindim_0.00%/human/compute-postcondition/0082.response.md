The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it. Given the initial state, let's calculate the new value of `ans`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is at least 2
- `count` is 2
- `ans` is equal to `n + g / count + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `countmins` is 1
- `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains unchanged.

The code snippet:
```
ans += g / count + 1
```

Given `count` is 2, the expression `g / count + 1` becomes `g / 2 + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` is:
`ans = n + g / count + 1 + g / count + 1`
`ans = n + g / 2 + 1 + g / 2 + 1`
`ans = n + g + 2`

Since `g` is defined as `n / 2 - countmins` and `countmins` is 1, `g` can be rewritten as `n / 2 - 1`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` is:
`ans = n + (n / 2 - 1) + 2`
`ans = n + n / 2 + 1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + n / 2 + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains unchanged.**
