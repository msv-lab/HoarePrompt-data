The code snippet `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` was previously defined as `n` plus the sum of a certain expression, but this assignment overwrites that value. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `count`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
