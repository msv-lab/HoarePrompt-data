The code snippet `ans += g / count + 1` modifies the value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially equal to `n`, and `g` is equal to `n / 2 - 1`. The value of `count` is 2.

Let's compute the change in `ans`:
- `g / count + 1` translates to `(n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`
- Simplifying this expression, we get `(n / 4 - 0.5) + 1` which further simplifies to `n / 4 + 0.5`

Thus, the new value of `ans` is `n + (n / 4 + 0.5)` or `ans = n + n / 4 + 0.5`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 0.5`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.**
