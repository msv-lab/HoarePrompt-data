Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - countmins) / 3 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4 - 3`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its previous value, where `g` is `n / 4 - 3` and `count` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
