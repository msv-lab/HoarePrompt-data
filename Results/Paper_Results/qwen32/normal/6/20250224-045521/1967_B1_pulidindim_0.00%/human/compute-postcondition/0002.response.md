The code snippet provided will read a line of input, split it into two parts, convert those parts to integers, and assign them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the integer values that were provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.**
