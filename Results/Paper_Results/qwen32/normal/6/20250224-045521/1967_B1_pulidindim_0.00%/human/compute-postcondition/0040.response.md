Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2` and `g` is less than `countmins`. The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The only change is that the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
