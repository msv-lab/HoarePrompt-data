Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n` plus the sum of `(n / count - countmins) / count + 1` for each iteration where `g >= countmins`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` has been set to 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
