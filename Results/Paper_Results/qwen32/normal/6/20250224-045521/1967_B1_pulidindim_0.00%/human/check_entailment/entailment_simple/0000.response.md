Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \( 1 \le a \le n \)
- \( 1 \le b \le m \)
- \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

The condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \( k \). This can be simplified to:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
\[ a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \]

This means that \( a \) must be a multiple of \( b \cdot (\gcd(a, b) - 1) \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a loop that iterates over possible values of \( b \) (denoted as `count` in the code) and calculates the number of valid pairs for each \( b \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. Read the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, read \( n \) and \( m \).
3. Initialize `count` to 2 (since \( b = 1 \) is trivial and handled separately) and `ans` to \( n \) (since for \( b = 1 \), every \( a \) from 1 to \( n \) is valid).
4. Loop over possible values of \( b \) from 2 to \( m \):
   - Calculate `countmins` as \( b - 1 \).
   - Calculate `g` as \( n / b \).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, break the loop.
   - Otherwise, update `g` to \( g - countmins \) and add \( g / b + 1 \) to `ans`.
5. Print the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`**: The initialization of `count` to 2 and `ans` to \( n \) is correct for \( b = 1 \), but the logic inside the loop seems incorrect.
2. **Logic Inside the Loop**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for each \( b \). The formula used to update `ans` does not match the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
