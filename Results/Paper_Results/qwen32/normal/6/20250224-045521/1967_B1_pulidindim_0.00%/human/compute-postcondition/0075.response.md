Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 3; `ans` is equal to `n + g / count + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
