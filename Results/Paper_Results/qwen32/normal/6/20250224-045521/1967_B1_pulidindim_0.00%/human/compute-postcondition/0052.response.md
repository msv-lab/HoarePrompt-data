Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
