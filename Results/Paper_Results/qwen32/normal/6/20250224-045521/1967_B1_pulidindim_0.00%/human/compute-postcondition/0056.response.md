Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of all variables remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but no variables are modified.
