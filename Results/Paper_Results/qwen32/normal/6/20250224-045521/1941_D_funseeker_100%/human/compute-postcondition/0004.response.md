The code snippet provided converts the variable `r` to an integer. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`) are affected by this operation. 

Since `r` is the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`, and we are converting `r` to an integer, the new value of `r` will be an integer representation of whatever string `r` held before the conversion.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`**.
