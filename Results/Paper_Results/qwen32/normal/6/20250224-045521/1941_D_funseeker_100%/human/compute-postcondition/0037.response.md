The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. Specifically, it adds the value `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the next element in `ans` that has not yet been processed, and `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` is not '1' or '?'**.
