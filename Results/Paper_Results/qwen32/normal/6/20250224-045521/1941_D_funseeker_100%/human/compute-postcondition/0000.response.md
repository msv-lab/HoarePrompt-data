The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. The initial state specifies the constraints on these variables, but since the function `func_3()` is not defined, we can only assume that it returns valid values within these constraints.

After the execution of the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be whatever `func_3()` returns, and they will still satisfy the initial conditions provided: `n` will be an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` will be an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` will be an integer between 1 and `n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`.**
