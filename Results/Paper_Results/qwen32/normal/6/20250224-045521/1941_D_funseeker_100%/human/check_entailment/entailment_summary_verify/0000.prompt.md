You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

#Function 1:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function calculates and prints the number of unique player positions that can be reached after `m` throws of a ball, starting from player `x` among `n` players, based on the operations defined by `r` and `c` for each throw. It also prints the sorted list of these unique positions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. It then processes each throw, updating the set `ans` to include all possible players who could have the ball after that throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions when the direction is unknown (`?`). After processing all throws, it prints the number of possible players and their numbers in increasing order.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Handling of Directions**:
   - If the direction is known (`0` or `1`), the code correctly updates the position.
   - If the direction is unknown (`?`), the code correctly considers both possible directions.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program uses `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to update positions. This ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the circle of players.
   - The special handling of `0` in the set `ans` is incorrect. If `0` is in `ans`, it should be mapped to `n` (the last player), but the code should not discard `0` and add `n` separately. Instead, it should correctly map `0` to `n` during the modulo operation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code should handle cases where `n` is small, such as `n = 2`.
   - It should handle cases where all throws are in the same direction or unknown.
   - It should handle cases where the starting player `x` is at the boundary (e.g., `x = 1` or `x = n`).

### Potential Issue

The main issue in the code is the way it handles the modulo operation and the special case of `0`. The correct way to handle the modulo operation to ensure positions wrap around correctly is to use `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` and `(q - r - 1) % n + 1` to avoid the need for special handling of `0`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program by checking a few edge cases and ensuring the logic is sound.

#### Edge Case 1: `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `x = 1`, `r = 1`, `c = '?'`
- Possible final positions: `1` and `2`.
- The current code will correctly handle this.

#### Edge Case 2: `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `x = 1`, `r1 = 1`, `c1 = '0'`, `r2 = 1`, `c2 = '1'`
- The ball starts at `1`, moves to `2` (clockwise), then moves to `1` (counterclockwise).
- The current code will correctly handle this.

#### Edge Case 3: `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `x = 1`, `r1 = 2`, `c1 = '?'`, `r2 = 2`, `c2 = '?'`, `r3 = 2`, `c3 = '?'`
- The ball can be at any position after these throws due to the unknown directions.
- The current code will correctly handle this.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and checking edge cases, the main issue is the incorrect handling of the modulo operation and the special case of `0`. The correct handling of modulo operations should ensure that positions wrap around correctly without needing to handle `0` separately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the modulo operation and the special case of `0`. The positions should be calculated using `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` and `(q - r - 1) % n + 1` to correctly wrap around within the circle of players without needing special handling of `0`.
