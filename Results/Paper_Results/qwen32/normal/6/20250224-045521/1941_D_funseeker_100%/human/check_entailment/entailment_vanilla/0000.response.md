Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, given that the ball can be thrown either clockwise or counterclockwise for some throws.
- **Input:**
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: Number of players.
    - `m`: Number of throws.
    - `x`: Initial player with the ball.
    - `m` lines of throw information: distance `r` and direction `c` ('0' for clockwise, '1' for counterclockwise, '?' for unknown).
- **Output:**
  - For each test case:
    - Number of possible players who could have the ball.
    - The sorted list of these player numbers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line and strips it.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the stripped line to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Splits the line and maps each element to an integer.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (`func_4()`):**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x`.
     - Initializes `ans` as a set containing the initial player `x`.
   - **Processing Each Throw:**
     - For each throw, reads `r` and `c`.
     - Initializes a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions.
     - For each player `q` in `ans`:
       - If the throw is clockwise (`c == '0'`) or unknown (`c == '?'`), it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
       - If the throw is counterclockwise (`c == '1'`) or unknown (`c == '?'`), it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
     - Updates `ans` to `temp` after processing the throw.
   - **Handling Modulo Result:**
     - If `0` is in `ans`, it removes `0` and adds `n` to ensure player numbers are between `1` and `n`.
   - **Output:**
     - Prints the number of possible players.
     - Prints the sorted list of possible players.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of Modulo Operations:**
  - `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handle the circular nature of the players.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - The special handling of `0` ensures that player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.
- **Handling of Unknown Directions:**
  - The program correctly considers both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities for unknown directions.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program processes each throw in constant time for each player in `ans`, making it efficient within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, considering all specified conditions.

**Correctness: True**
