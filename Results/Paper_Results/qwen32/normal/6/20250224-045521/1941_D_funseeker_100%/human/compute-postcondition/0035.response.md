Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and if `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` will remain an empty set. All other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition.
