The code snippet adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `temp` initially contains the element `(q + r) % n`, after executing the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
