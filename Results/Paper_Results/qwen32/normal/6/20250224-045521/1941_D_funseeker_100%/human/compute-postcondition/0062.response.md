The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`. The only change is that `temp` now includes the additional element `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains `(next_q + r) % n` as an additional element. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `temp` now contains `(q - r) % n` as an element.**
