The code snippet adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Since `c` is either '0' or '?', and the current value of `c` is '1' or '?', the initial condition for `temp` still holds. The only change is that `temp` now includes an additional element `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', and also contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**
