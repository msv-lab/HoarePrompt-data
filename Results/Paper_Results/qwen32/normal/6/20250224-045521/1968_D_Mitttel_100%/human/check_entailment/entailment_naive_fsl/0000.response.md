Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a few issues that could lead to incorrect results. One primary issue is the decrementing of the elements in the `p` and `a` lists by 1. The problem description specifies that the permutation `p` and array `a` are 1-indexed, meaning that indices start from 1. By decrementing these values, the code is treating them as 0-indexed, which could lead to incorrect results.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Indexing Issue**:
   - The lines `p[i] -= 1` and `a[i] -= 1` convert the 1-indexed inputs to 0-indexed. However, the rest of the code does not account for this change correctly.
   - The function `func_1` uses the values in `p` and `a` directly without adjusting for the 0-indexing, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the score by multiplying `a[s]` with `k` and adding it to `cur`. However, the problem description specifies that the score should increase by `a_x` on each turn, not `k * a_x`.
   - The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` should be `mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])` because the score should increase by `a_x` on each turn, not `k * a_x`.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - The while loop condition `while not vis[s] and k > 0` is correct in terms of avoiding revisiting a position. However, the decrementing of `k` and updating of `s` should ensure that `k` reaches 0 or a cycle is detected.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s] - 1  # Correctly adjust for 1-indexing
    return mx
```

In the corrected version, the score is incremented by `a[s]` on each turn, and the position `s` is correctly adjusted for 1-indexing when updating to `p[s] - 1`. This ensures that the program works as expected for all potential cases.
