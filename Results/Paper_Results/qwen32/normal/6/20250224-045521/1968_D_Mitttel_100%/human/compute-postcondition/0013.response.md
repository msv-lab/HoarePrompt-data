The code snippet provided increments the variable `cur` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `cur` was initially set to `a[0]`. After the operation, `cur` becomes `a[0] + a[s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is an index in `p` such that `vis[s]` is 1; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
