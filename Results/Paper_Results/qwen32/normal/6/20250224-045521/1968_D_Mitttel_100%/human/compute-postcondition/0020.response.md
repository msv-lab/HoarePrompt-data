The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + 2 * a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
