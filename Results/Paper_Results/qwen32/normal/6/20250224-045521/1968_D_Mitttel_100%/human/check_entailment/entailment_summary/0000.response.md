### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the `func_1` function and ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mx` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the maximum score that can be achieved.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the current accumulated score.
   - `vis` is an array of size `n` initialized to 0. This array is used to detect cycles in the permutation `p`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - The current position `s` is marked as visited (`vis[s] = 1`).
     - The maximum score `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`. This step ensures that we consider the best possible score that can be achieved by staying in the current position for the remaining `k` turns.
     - The current score `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`, reflecting the score obtained by being in the current position.
     - `k` is decremented by 1, as one turn has been used.
     - The current position `s` is updated to the next position in the permutation (`s = p[s]`).

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum score that can be achieved starting from the initial position `s` and playing for `k` turns.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the input values and adjusts the indices to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from `pb`, `ps`, and each element in `p` and `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to compute their maximum achievable scores (`A` and `B`).
   - Based on the comparison of `A` and `B`, the program prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic within `func_1` correctly computes the maximum score for a player starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns. It handles the case where a cycle is detected by stopping the loop when `s` is visited again.
- The main loop correctly processes each test case and compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner or if it's a draw.
- The adjustments for 0-based indexing are correctly applied to the input data.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the problem requirements and handle the input as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
