The code snippet reads an input string, splits it by whitespace, converts each split string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `_` or `n` directly. Therefore, the variable `_` remains incremented by 1, and `n` retains its value as an input integer. The new variable `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
