The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This change affects the value of `cnt` but does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `ans` directly. The precondition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` remains valid, except now `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, `cnt` is 0.**
