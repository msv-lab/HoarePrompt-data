You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each execution, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. The variable `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. The variable `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`. The variable `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` throughout the loop. After processing the entire list `a`, if `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the value of `ans`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The logic in the provided code seems to be attempting to find the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then use that to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The array is beautiful because we can apply the operation to make all elements the same. To stop it from being beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements to break the pattern. For example, removing the first three elements results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
The provided code will output `-1` for this input because it incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

### Why the Code is Incorrect:

The code incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements. This is not always true. The correct approach involves checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. This involves checking the structure of the array and ensuring that the removal of elements results in an array that is not beautiful.

Since the provided code does not handle this correctly, the Correctness is **False**.
