To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables as described in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`: Remains the same (no specific value provided, but it is not equal to 1).
- `_`: Remains the same (no specific value or usage provided).
- `a`: Remains the same (no specific value provided).
- `tmp`: Remains the same (no specific value provided).
- `cnt`: Count of consecutive `tmp` at the end of the list or 0.
- `ans`: Minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is described as the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. This suggests that `ans` is being updated during a loop to track the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.

Since no specific values for `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or the list (if any) are provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions given:
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Output:
Given the conditions, we can say that `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop, and it is not equal to `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop and is not equal to `n`)**
