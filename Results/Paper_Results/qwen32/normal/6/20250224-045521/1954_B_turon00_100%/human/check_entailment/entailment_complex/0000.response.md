Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being "beautiful." The provided code attempts to find the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array (`tmp`). However, this approach is incorrect because the array can be beautiful even if the first element is not the only element repeated throughout the array. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The shortest contiguous subarray containing only the first element `1` is of length 1, but removing just one element does not make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, we need to find a way to identify the minimum number of removals that disrupt the "beautiful" property for any element in the array.

The current implementation does not account for this and only considers the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
