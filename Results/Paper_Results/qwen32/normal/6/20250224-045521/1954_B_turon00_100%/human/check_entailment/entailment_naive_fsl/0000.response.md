Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The logic in the provided code seems to be attempting to find the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then use that to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The array is beautiful because we can apply the operation to make all elements the same. To stop it from being beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements to break the pattern. For example, removing the first three elements results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
The provided code will output `-1` for this input because it incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

### Why the Code is Incorrect:

The code incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements. This is not always true. The correct approach involves checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. This involves checking the structure of the array and ensuring that the removal of elements results in an array that is not beautiful.

Since the provided code does not handle this correctly, the Correctness is **False**.
