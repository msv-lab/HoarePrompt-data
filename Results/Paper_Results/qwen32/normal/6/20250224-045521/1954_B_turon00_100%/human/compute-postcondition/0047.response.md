The value of `cnt` is set to 0. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the new value of `cnt` (which is 0). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, `cnt` is 0**.
