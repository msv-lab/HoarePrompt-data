The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (since `tmp` is initialized to `a[0]` and the loop hasn't started yet) and `n` is the length of the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; `i` is 1**
