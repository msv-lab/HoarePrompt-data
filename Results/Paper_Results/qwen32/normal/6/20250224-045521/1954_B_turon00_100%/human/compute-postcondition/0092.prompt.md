Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`; `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains the same, `_` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `cnt` is the count of consecutive `tmp` at the end of the list or 0, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `_`, `a`, and `tmp` are unchanged. `cnt` is 0. `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
