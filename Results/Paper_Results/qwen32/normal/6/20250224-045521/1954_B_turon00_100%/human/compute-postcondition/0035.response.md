The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `_`, `n`, `a`, or `tmp`. Therefore, the values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `tmp` is the first element of `a`; `cnt` is 0**.
