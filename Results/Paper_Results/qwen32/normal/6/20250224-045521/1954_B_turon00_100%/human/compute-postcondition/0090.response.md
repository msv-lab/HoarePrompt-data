Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is unchanged.
- `_` is unchanged.
- `a` is unchanged.
- `tmp` is unchanged.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`.
- `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Key Points:
1. `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
2. `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt` (which is 0). This implies that `ans` will be either its original value if it was less than 0, or 0 if it was greater than or equal to 0.
3. The condition `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n` does not affect the value of `ans` directly but provides constraints on the possible values of `n` and `ans`.

### Analysis:
- Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be the minimum of its original value and 0. Therefore, `ans` will be 0 if its original value was greater than or equal to 0, or it will remain its original value if it was less than 0.
- However, the problem does not specify the original value of `ans`, so we can only say that `ans` is the minimum of its original value and 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is that `ans` will be the minimum of its original value and 0.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its original value and 0)**
