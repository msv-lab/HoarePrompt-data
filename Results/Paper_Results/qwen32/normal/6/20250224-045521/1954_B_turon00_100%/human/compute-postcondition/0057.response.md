Postcondition: **`n` remains the same, `_` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `cnt` is the count of consecutive `tmp` at the end of the list or 0, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.**
