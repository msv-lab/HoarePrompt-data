### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided code to verify its correctness based on the given function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- An array is beautiful if it can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using the specified operation.
- If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should return `-1`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by finding the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array. It then uses this length to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` counts the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `ans` keeps track of the minimum length of sequences of identical elements found.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - The code iterates through the array.
   - If the current element matches `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element does not match `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 1.
   
3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` to consider the last sequence of identical elements.
   
4. **Decision**:
   - If the array length is 1 or `ans` equals the array length, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

#### Issues in the Code:
The code's logic is fundamentally flawed. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it focuses on finding the shortest sequence of identical elements, which is not relevant to the problem's objective.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the longest sequence of identical elements in the array.
2. If the entire array is a single sequence, return `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
3. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence minus 1 (since removing all but one of the longest sequence will ensure the array is no longer beautiful).

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
