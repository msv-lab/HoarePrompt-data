To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
4. **`tmp`**: Set to the first element of the list `a`, i.e., `tmp = a[0]`.
5. **`cnt`**: The length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`.
6. **`ans`**: The length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
7. **Additional Conditions**:
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Determining the Value of `ans`:
- **`tmp`**: This is the first element of the list `a`.
- **`cnt`**: This is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`. This means it counts how many consecutive elements starting from the first element are equal to `tmp`.
- **`ans`**: This is initially set to `cnt` (the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`). However, it is then updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` is initially `cnt` and is updated to the minimum of itself and `cnt`, `ans` remains `cnt` unless there is another subarray of length less than `cnt` that contains only `tmp`. The problem states that `ans` is not equal to `n`, which means not all elements in the list are the same.

### Conclusion:
The value of `ans` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp` (since `ans` is not updated to a smaller value and is not equal to `n`).

### Final Output:
Output: **`cnt` (where `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`)**
