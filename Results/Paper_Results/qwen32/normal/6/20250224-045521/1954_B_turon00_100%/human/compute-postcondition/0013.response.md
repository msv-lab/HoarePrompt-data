Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
