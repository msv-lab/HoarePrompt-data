The code snippet `lst[b].append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list stored at the key `b` in the defaultdict `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves.
- The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` are the two integers read from the input.
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.
- `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` twice and `lst[b]` includes `a`.

After executing `lst[b].append(a)`, the list at key `b` in `lst` will include `a` one more time. Therefore, `lst[b]` will contain `a` three times.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is 2; `y` are the two integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` twice and `lst[b]` includes `a` three times.**
