The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means that the list `lst[x]` will have one less element after this operation.

Given the initial state, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` contains at least one element. After the `pop` operation, `lst[x]` will still be a list, but it will have one less element than before. The value of `y` will be the element that was popped from `lst[x]`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `u_1, ..., u_t`, `s`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` contains at least one element but one less than before, `x` is the last node that was traversed, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is False.**
