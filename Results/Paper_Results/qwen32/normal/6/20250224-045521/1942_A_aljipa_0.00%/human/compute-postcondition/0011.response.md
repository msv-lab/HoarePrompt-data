Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` is updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a range object from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is set to `[-1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
