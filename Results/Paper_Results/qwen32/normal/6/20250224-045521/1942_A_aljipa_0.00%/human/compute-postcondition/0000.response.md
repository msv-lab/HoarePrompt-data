`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as initially described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.**
