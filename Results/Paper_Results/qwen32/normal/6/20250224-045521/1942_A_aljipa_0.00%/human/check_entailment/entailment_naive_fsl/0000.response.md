Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, it only covers three cases:
1. When `k == n`, it returns an array of all `1`s, which is correct.
2. When `k == 1`, it returns an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which is also correct.
3. For any other value of `k`, it returns `-1`.

However, there are cases where `1 < k < n` that the program does not handle correctly. For example:

- **Case**: `n = 3` and `k = 2`
  - The program returns `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 2]`, where the first and third shifts are sorted.

- **Case**: `n = 4` and `k = 2`
  - The program returns `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, `[2, 3, 1, 1]`, `[3, 1, 1, 2]`, and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, where the first and last shifts are sorted.

These examples show that the program does not generate a valid array for all values of `k` between `1` and `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
