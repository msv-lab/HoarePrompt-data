Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`.**

### Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the value of `res`.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the value of `res`.
- `res` is assigned a specific value based on the condition:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals `1`, `res` becomes a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` becomes a list with a single element `-1`.
