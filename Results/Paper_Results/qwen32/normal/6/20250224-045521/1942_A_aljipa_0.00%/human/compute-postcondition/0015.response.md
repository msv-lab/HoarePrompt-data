Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. It then prints a list of `n` integers based on the value of `k`: if `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k` equals `1`, it prints a list of integers from `0` to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.**
