In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t` to ensure that the loop executes.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `n` and `k` do not need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head and their values are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
