### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem based on specific conditions for `k`:
1. If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`). 
   - This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array of identical elements are sorted.
2. If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - This is correct because only the first cyclic shift (which is the array itself) is sorted.
3. If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, it outputs `-1`.
   - This is incorrect because there could be other valid configurations for `k` that are not handled by the program. For example, there are valid arrays where `1 < k < n` that have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

### Example of a Missing Case:
Consider `n = 4` and `k = 2`. One valid array could be `[1, 2, 4, 3]`:
- Cyclic shifts:
  - `[1, 2, 4, 3]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 4, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
  - `[4, 3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
  - `[3, 1, 2, 4]` (sorted)

Thus, the program should be able to handle cases where `1 < k < n` and output a valid array for those cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all valid cases for `k` and therefore is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
