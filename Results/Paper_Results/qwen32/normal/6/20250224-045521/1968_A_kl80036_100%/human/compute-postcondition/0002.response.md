Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the following t lines, `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000; `y` is equal to `x - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each of the `t` lines, the value of `x` remains the same as the input, but `y` is now equal to `x - 1`.
