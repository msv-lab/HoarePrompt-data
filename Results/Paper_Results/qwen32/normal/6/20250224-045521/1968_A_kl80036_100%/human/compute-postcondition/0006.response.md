The code snippet `y = x - 1` reassigns the value of `y` to be `x - 1`. Given the initial state, `y` was already defined as `x - 1`, so reassigning it does not change its value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` is equal to `x - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
