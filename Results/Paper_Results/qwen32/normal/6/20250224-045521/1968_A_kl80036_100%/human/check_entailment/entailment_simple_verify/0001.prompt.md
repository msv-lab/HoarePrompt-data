You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the following t lines, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, an integer `x` was read such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` was calculated as `x - 1`, and `y` was printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

The problem requires finding an integer `y` (where `1 <= y < x`) such that the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it simply outputs `y = x - 1`.

To verify the correctness of this approach, let's consider the properties of the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):

1. The GCD of `x` and `y` is maximized when `y` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x`. This is because the GCD is a divisor of both `x` and `y`, and the largest possible divisor of `x` (other than `x` itself) is `x - 1` if `x` is prime, or the largest proper divisor if `x` is composite.

2. When `y = x - 1`, `\gcd(x, x - 1)` is either 1 (if `x` is even) or a small number (if `x` is odd and composite). However, the value of `y` itself is `x - 1`, which is the largest possible value for `y` under the constraint `1 <= y < x`.

3. The expression `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized when `y` is as large as possible because the GCD term is relatively small compared to `y` itself when `y` is close to `x`.

Given these points, the program's approach of always choosing `y = x - 1` is reasonable and will yield a correct result in terms of maximizing the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

However, the problem statement specifies that if there are multiple `y` that satisfy the condition, any one of them is acceptable. While `y = x - 1` is a valid choice, it is not necessarily the only choice that maximizes the expression. For example, for `x = 6`, `y = 3` also maximizes the expression because `\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is the same as `\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`.

Despite this, the problem does not require finding all possible `y` that maximize the expression, only one such `y`. Therefore, the program's approach is correct given the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
