The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the following `t` lines, `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000; `y` is equal to `x - 1`; `i` is incremented by 1. After executing the line `x = int(input())`, the value of `x` will be the integer input provided, and the values of `t`, `y`, and `i` will remain as they were before the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` is equal to `x - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
