To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it satisfies the problem requirements. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

The provided program always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case. Let's evaluate if this approach guarantees that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

### Analysis:
1. **GCD and y Selection**:
   - The GCD function, \(\gcd(x, y)\), returns the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Setting \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) is a common heuristic because \( x - 1 \) is likely to share fewer common factors with \( x \) than other values of \( y \), except for some special cases.
   - However, it does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

2. **Special Cases**:
   - For example, when \( x = 6 \), the optimal \( y \) is \( 3 \) because \(\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\), which is greater than \(\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\).
   - When \( x = 10 \), the optimal \( y \) is \( 5 \) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
   - When \( x = 7 \), the optimal \( y \) is \( 6 \) because \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is the maximum possible since \(\gcd(7, y) + y\) will be less for other \( y \) values.
   
3. **General Case**:
   - The provided program does not consider these special cases and always outputs \( x - 1 \).
   - While \( x - 1 \) can sometimes be optimal, it is not always the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
