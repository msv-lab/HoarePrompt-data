Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `n` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is equal to `n` - 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so if `ind` was initially equal to `n`, it is now equal to `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
