The code snippet `p = [0] * n` initializes the list `p` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This overwrites the previous definition of `p` where `p[2j] = n - 2j` for `j` such that `2j < n`, and `p[i] = ind_initial + 2*k` for `i` in the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., `n-1` or 1, 3, 5, ..., `n-2`.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` also remains the same as it was read from the input. The variable `ind` and the calculations related to it are not affected by this line of code, as they are not used or modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the integer read from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.**
