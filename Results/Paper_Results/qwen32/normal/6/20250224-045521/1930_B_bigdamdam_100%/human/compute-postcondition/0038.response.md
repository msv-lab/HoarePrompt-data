Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 6, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first four elements are 0, the fifth element is `n-2`, the sixth element is `n-4`, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is equal to `n - 6`, `i` is 6**.

In this output state, the value of `ind` has been decremented by 2, making it `n - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
