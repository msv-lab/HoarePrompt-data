Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is unchanged, `p` is a list where the elements at odd indices 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n` are set to `ind`, `ind+2`, `ind+4`, ..., respectively, and the rest are 0, `ind` is the initial value of `ind` (1 if `n` is even and 2 if `n` is odd) plus `2 * floor(n/2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is the input integer, p is a list of n elements where p[2j] = n - 2j for j such that 2j < n, and p[i] = ind_initial + 2*k for i in the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1 or 1, 3, 5, ..., n-2, where k is the iteration number starting from 0, ind = initial_ind + 2 * floor(n/2).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the integer read from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at odd indices are 1, 5, 9, ..., up to the largest odd index less than `n` with values following the sequence 1, 5, 9, ..., and elements at even indices up to `n-2` (or `n-3` if `n` is odd) are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., and the rest are 0, and `ind` is `2 * (n // 2) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
