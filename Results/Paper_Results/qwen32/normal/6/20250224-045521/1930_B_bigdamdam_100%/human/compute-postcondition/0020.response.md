The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. The value of `ind` was 3 if `n` is even and 4 if `n` is odd. Therefore, after the increment, `ind` will be 5 if `n` is even and 6 if `n` is odd. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list where the first floor(n/2) elements are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1) except the element at index `i + 2` which is `ind`, and the rest are 0, `ind` is 5 if `n` is even and 6 if `n` is odd, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2.**
