The given code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the `i`-th element of the list `p`. Given the initial state, `ind` is equal to `n`, and `p` is a list of `n` zeros. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact index being modified. Assuming `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `p` (i.e., `0 <= i < n`), the `i`-th element of `p` will be updated to the value of `ind`, which is `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `n` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is equal to `n`**.
