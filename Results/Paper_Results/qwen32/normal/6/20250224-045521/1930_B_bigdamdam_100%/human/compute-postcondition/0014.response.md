The code snippet `ind = 1 + n % 2` modifies the value of `ind` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, `n % 2` will be `0` if `n` is even and `1` if `n` is odd. Therefore, `ind` will be `1` if `n` is even (since `1 + 0 = 1`) and `2` if `n` is odd (since `1 + 1 = 2`).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `p`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list where the first floor(n/2) elements are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1) and the rest are 0, `ind` is 1 if n is even and 2 if n is odd.**
