The code snippet `p = [0] * n` initializes the list `p` with `n` zeros, effectively overwriting the previous definition of `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is the initial value of `ind` (1 if the initial `n` is even and 2 if the initial `n` is odd) plus `2 * floor(initial n/2)`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
