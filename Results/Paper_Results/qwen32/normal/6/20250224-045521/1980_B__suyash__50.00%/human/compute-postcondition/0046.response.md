To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, we need to understand the conditions and values of the variables described in the initial state.

Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Input and Initialization**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`.
   - `o` is a list of substrings from a new input line sorted in descending order.
   - `n` is the first element of `b`.
   - `f` is the second element of `b`.
   - `k` is the third element of `b` minus the count of occurrences of `l[i]` in `o` if `fav` is not equal to `l[i]` minus `dic[l[i]]`.
   - `fav` is the substring at index `f - 1` of `o`.
   - `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique substring in `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that substring in `o`.
   - `l` is a list of unique substrings from `o` sorted in descending order and must contain at least one unique substring.

2. **Conditional Statements**:
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.
   - The index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1` if the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute if none of the conditions that cause a break in the loop or if statement are met.

Given the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement will execute only if the program does not encounter a break condition. The break condition is met if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`. However, since `i` is initialized to 1 and `l` is a list of unique substrings, the likelihood of `fav` being equal to `l[1]` depends on the input data.

Since the exact input data is not provided, we can't determine if the break condition will be met or not. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'YES' if the break condition is not met.

Output: **YES (if the break condition is not met)**
