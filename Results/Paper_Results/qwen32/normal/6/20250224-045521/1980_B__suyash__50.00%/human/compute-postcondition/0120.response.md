Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is a string equal to the user's input, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new user input sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `fav` is the substring at index `f - 1` in the list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique substring from the list `o` and each value is the count of that substring in `o`, `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least one element. `k` is calculated as the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the element at index `i` in the list `l` from the dictionary `dic`. If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, `k` is further decreased by the count of `l[i]` in `dic`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of the value of `k`.**
