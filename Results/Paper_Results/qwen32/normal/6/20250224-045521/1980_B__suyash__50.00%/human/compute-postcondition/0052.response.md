The print statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function. This means that regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NO**
