The given initial state provides values and relationships for several variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
