The code snippet assigns the third element of the list `b` to the variable `k`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is a string equal to the user's input, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new user input, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`.**
