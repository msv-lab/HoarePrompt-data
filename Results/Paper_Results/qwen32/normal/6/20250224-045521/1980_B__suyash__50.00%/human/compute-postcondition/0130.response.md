The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, or `f` are altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`i` is the length of `l` + 1, `k` is `b[2]`, `t` must be greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input, `n` is `b[0]`, `f` is `b[1]`.**
