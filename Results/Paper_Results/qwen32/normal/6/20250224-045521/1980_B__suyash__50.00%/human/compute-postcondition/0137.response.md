Postcondition: **`i` is the length of `l` + 1, `k` is `b[2]`, `t` is greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input and sorted in reverse order, `n` is `b[0]`, `f` is `b[1]`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `o`. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, no change occurs.**
