The code snippet `last.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `last`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, the list `last` will have an additional element `3` appended to it.

Let's break down the possible states of `last` before and after the operation:
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is initially `[-1, i, i]`, which translates to `[-1, 3, 3]`. After appending `i`, `last` becomes `[-1, 3, 3, 3]`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is initially `[-1, 2, 2]`. After appending `i`, `last` becomes `[-1, 2, 2, 3]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `i` is 3, `last` is either `[-1, 3, 3, 3]` or `[-1, 2, 2, 3]` depending on whether `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
