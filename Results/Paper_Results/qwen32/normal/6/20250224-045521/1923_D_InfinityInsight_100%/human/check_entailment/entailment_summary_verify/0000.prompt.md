You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Program:
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (for `i` from `1` to `n-1`) is `1` if the size of the slime at index `i` is less than the size of the slime at index `i-1`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by a helper function `func_1` and the last index where a change in slime size was observed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. 

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `left` Array**: The `left` array is supposed to store the cumulative sum of the slime sizes up to each index. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cumulative sum by adding `-1` in the line `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`. This adjustment is not justified by the problem statement and leads to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `bisect_left`**: The function `bisect_left` is used to find the position to insert `x` in the `left` array such that the array remains sorted. However, the value of `x` is calculated incorrectly as mentioned above, and the use of `bisect_left` here does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Logic for Determining `ans` Array**: The logic for determining the `ans` array is flawed. The code attempts to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum up to that point is less than the current slime size minus one, but this does not correctly determine the minimum number of seconds for the slime to be eaten. Additionally, the use of `last` array and the comparison `if inx2 < inx` are not clear and do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all slimes are of the same size, the program should return `-1` for all slimes, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may not produce the expected output due to the incorrect logic described above.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
