Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. 

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `left` Array**: The `left` array is supposed to store the cumulative sum of the slime sizes up to each index. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cumulative sum by adding `-1` in the line `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`. This adjustment is not justified by the problem statement and leads to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `bisect_left`**: The function `bisect_left` is used to find the position to insert `x` in the `left` array such that the array remains sorted. However, the value of `x` is calculated incorrectly as mentioned above, and the use of `bisect_left` here does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Logic for Determining `ans` Array**: The logic for determining the `ans` array is flawed. The code attempts to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum up to that point is less than the current slime size minus one, but this does not correctly determine the minimum number of seconds for the slime to be eaten. Additionally, the use of `last` array and the comparison `if inx2 < inx` are not clear and do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all slimes are of the same size, the program should return `-1` for all slimes, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may not produce the expected output due to the incorrect logic described above.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
