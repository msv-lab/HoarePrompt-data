The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Therefore, none of the variables `a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `last`, `x`, `inx`, or `inx2` will be changed by this statement.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. The current value of `inx` is less than `0`.**
