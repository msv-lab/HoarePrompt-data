The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the `last` list to itself. Given the initial state, `last` is either `[-1, i]` or `[-1, -1]`. Since `i` is 2, `last` is `[-1, 2]`. After appending the last element of `last` (which is `2`), `last` becomes `[-1, 2, 2]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `last` is `[-1, 2, 2]`, `i` is 2.**
