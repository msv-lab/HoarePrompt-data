Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `1` if `a[2] < a[1]`. `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed. `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged. `i` is 2.**
