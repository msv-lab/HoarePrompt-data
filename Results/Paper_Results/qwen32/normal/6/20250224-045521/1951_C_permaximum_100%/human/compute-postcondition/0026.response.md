To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve over time. The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `total_cost` starts at 0.
   - `tickets_bought` starts at 0.
   - `price_increase` starts at 0.
   - `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, the smallest tuple `(price, day)` is popped from the heap `pq`.
   - The `price` is increased by the current `price_increase`.
   - The number of tickets to buy, `tickets_to_buy`, is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The `total_cost` is updated by adding `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - The `tickets_bought` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy`.
   - The `price_increase` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.

Given these steps, after all iterations, the final state will be:
- `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
- `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, considering the increasing prices.
- `price_increase` will be the cumulative sum of `tickets_to_buy` over all iterations.
- `pq` will have fewer elements, specifically excluding the tuples that were popped.

Let's formalize the final state:

- `total_cost` will be the sum of the prices of the tickets bought, each adjusted by the `price_increase` at the time of purchase.
- `tickets_bought` will be `k`.
- `price_increase` will be the cumulative sum of all `tickets_to_buy` values over the iterations.
- `pq` will be a heapified list of tuples excluding the tuples that were popped.

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the tuples that were popped; `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets with the adjusted prices; `tickets_bought` is `k`; `price_increase` is the cumulative sum of `tickets_to_buy` over all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, `total_cost` will reflect the total cost of buying `k` tickets considering the increasing prices, and `pq` will be a heapified list excluding the tuples corresponding to the tickets that were bought.
