The code snippet `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` updates the `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `total_cost` was 0. After the execution of the code, `total_cost` will be `price * tickets_to_buy`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, `price`, `day`, and `tickets_to_buy` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list, `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k)**.
