The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest tuple from the heap `pq` and assigns the first element of the tuple to `price` and the second element to `day`. This means that `price` will now hold the smallest price from the heap, and `day` will hold the corresponding index from the `prices` list.

Given this, the `pq` heap will have one less element after the operation. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by `price` or `day`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) - 1`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`**.
