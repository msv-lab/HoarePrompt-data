Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) * 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 1`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k) + tickets_to_buy`; `price` is the original smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop plus `min(m, k)`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `4 * min(m, k) - 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k) + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop plus `price_increase`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`; `total_cost` is updated to `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
