The code snippet provided increments the `price` variable by the value of `price_increase`. Since the initial state specifies that `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` and `price_increase` is 0, the value of `price` remains unchanged after the operation. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list.**
