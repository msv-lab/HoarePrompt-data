The loop condition is `while tickets_bought < k`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `tickets_bought` is still less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 1`.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9)`.

Since `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 1`, the maximum value `tickets_bought` can take is `2 * k - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust `tickets_bought` to be less than `k`.

Given the calculation of `tickets_bought`, the only way to ensure `tickets_bought < k` is to make sure that `tickets_bought` is not equal to `k - 1` or greater. Since `tickets_bought` is calculated as `2 * min(m, k) - 1`, we need to adjust `tickets_bought` to be less than `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we can adjust `tickets_bought` to be `tickets_bought - 1` (or any value less than `k`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k) + tickets_to_buy`; `price` is the original smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop plus `min(m, k)`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**
