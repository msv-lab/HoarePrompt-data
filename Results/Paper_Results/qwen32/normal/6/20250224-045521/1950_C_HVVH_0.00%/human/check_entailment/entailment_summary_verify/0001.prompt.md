You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format "hh:mm", converts it to 12-hour format with AM/PM, and prints the converted time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly converts time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This variable will keep track of whether the time is AM or PM.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   - For each test case, the time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) is read as a string and then split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` (the hour) is 0:
     - Set `h` to 12 (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
     - Set `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12:
     - Convert `h` to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from it.
     - Set `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive):
     - Set `day` to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'AM' (since 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format).

4. **Output**:
   - The time in 12-hour format is printed with leading zeros for hours and minutes using the format string `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` and the appropriate `day`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of 12 PM**:
  - The logic sets `day` to 'PM' for any `h` between 1 and 12, and then checks if `h` is 12 to set `day` to 'AM'. This is incorrect because 12 in 24-hour format is always 'PM' in 12-hour format.
  - The correct logic should be:
    - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
    - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
    - If `h` is greater than 12, subtract 12 from `h` and set `day` to 'PM'.
    - If `h` is between 1 and 11, set `day` to 'AM'.

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly handles the conversion of 12 PM and needs to be corrected. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
