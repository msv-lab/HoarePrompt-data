Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is the hour part of the input time. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` remains 'PM'. If `h` is less than 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is 0, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.**
