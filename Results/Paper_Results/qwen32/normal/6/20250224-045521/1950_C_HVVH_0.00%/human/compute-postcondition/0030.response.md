To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and modified.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 1440 (inclusive). This value represents the number of minutes past midnight.
2. **`s`**: A string in the format "hh:mm", representing the time in 24-hour format.
3. **`n`**: Initially defined as `n - 1`, but it is stated that it must still be greater than 0. So, `n` is some integer greater than 1.
4. **`m`**: Remains unchanged. It is the minute part of the time string `s`.
5. **`h`**: The hour part of the time string `s`, which undergoes transformation based on certain conditions:
   - If `h` was 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` was greater than 12, it is reduced by 12 and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` was 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

### Steps to Determine Output:
1. **Extract `h` and `m` from `s`**:
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s` converted to an integer.
   - `m` is the last two characters of `s` converted to an integer.

2. **Transform `h` and determine `day`**:
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

3. **Print the formatted string**:
   - The format is `'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day`, which means `h` and `m` will be printed as two-digit numbers (with leading zeros if necessary), followed by the `day`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s` is "13:45":
- `h` is 13 and `m` is 45.
- Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes `13 - 12 = 1` and `day` becomes 'PM'.
- The print statement will output `01:45 PM`.

Let's assume `s` is "00:30":
- `h` is 0 and `m` is 30.
- Since `h` is 0, `h` becomes 12 and `day` becomes 'AM'.
- The print statement will output `12:30 AM`.

Let's assume `s` is "12:00":
- `h` is 12 and `m` is 0.
- Since `h` is 12, `day` becomes 'AM'.
- The print statement will output `12:00 AM`.

Let's assume `s` is "11:59":
- `h` is 11 and `m` is 59.
- Since `h` is not 0, not greater than 12, and not 12, `day` remains 'PM'.
- The print statement will output `11:59 PM`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state, the print statement will output the transformed hour `h` and minute `m` in a 12-hour format along with the appropriate `day` ('AM' or 'PM').

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are derived from the time string s and day is determined based on the value of h)**
