Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

Here's the key logic of the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format.
3. It then converts the hour part (`h`) to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format:
    - If `h` is `0`, it sets `h` to `12` and the day to `'AM'`.
    - If `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets the day to `'PM'`.
    - Otherwise, it sets the day to `'PM'` (this includes the case when `h` is `12`), but it then checks if `h` is `12` specifically and sets the day to `'AM'` if it is.

Let's check if this logic is correct:

- For `h` equal to `0`, setting `h` to `12` and the day to `'AM'` is correct.
- For `h` greater than `12`, subtracting `12` from `h` and setting the day to `'PM'` is correct.
- For `h` equal to `12`, setting the day to `'PM'` and then changing it to `'AM'` is correct.

However, there is a mistake in the logic where it sets the day to `'PM'` for all `h` values not equal to `0` and then changes it to `'AM'` only if `h` is `12`. This is incorrect because `h` values from `1` to `11` should remain `'AM'`.

The correct logic should be:
- If `h` is `0`, set `h` to `12` and the day to `'AM'`.
- If `h` is `12`, set the day to `'PM'`.
- If `h` is greater than `12`, subtract `12` from `h` and set the day to `'PM'`.
- Otherwise, set the day to `'AM'`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Since the original program does not handle the case for `h` values from `1` to `11` correctly, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
