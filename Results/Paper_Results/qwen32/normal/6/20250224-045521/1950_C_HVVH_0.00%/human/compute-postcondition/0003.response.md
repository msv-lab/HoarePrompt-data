The code snippet assigns the values of `h` and `m` by splitting the input string at the colon and converting the resulting parts to integers. This means `h` will hold the hour part and `m` will hold the minute part of the input time.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time.**
