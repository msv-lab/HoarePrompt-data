Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly converts time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This variable will keep track of whether the time is AM or PM.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   - For each test case, the time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) is read as a string and then split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` (the hour) is 0:
     - Set `h` to 12 (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
     - Set `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12:
     - Convert `h` to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from it.
     - Set `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive):
     - Set `day` to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'AM' (since 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format).

4. **Output**:
   - The time in 12-hour format is printed with leading zeros for hours and minutes using the format string `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` and the appropriate `day`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of 12 PM**:
  - The logic sets `day` to 'PM' for any `h` between 1 and 12, and then checks if `h` is 12 to set `day` to 'AM'. This is incorrect because 12 in 24-hour format is always 'PM' in 12-hour format.
  - The correct logic should be:
    - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
    - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
    - If `h` is greater than 12, subtract 12 from `h` and set `day` to 'PM'.
    - If `h` is between 1 and 11, set `day` to 'AM'.

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly handles the conversion of 12 PM and needs to be corrected. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
