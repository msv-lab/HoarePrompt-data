Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is equal to 12, and `h` is not equal to 0 and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `day` has been updated to 'AM'. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
