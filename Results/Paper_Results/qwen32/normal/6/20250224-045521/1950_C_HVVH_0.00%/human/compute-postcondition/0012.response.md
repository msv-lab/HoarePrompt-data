The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `day`. This change affects the value of `day` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is not equal to 0 and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**
