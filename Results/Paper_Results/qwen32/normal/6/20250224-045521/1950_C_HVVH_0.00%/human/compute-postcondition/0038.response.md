Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `day` is 'AM'.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the value of `day` has been updated from 'PM' to 'AM'. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
