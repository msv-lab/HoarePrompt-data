Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format; day is 'AM'; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `m` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is equal to 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `m` remains unchanged. If `h` was 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` was greater than 12, `h` is `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` was 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `day` is determined based on the value of `h`. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` remains 'PM'. If `h` is less than 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is 0, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
