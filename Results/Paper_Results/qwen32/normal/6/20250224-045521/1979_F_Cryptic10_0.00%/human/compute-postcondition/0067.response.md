The code removes `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given the initial state, if `v` is 0, `remaining_vertices` initially contains integers from 1 to `n`. If `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`. After `v` is removed, `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`.

Output State: **`path` is a list `[v, v, v]`. If `v` is 0, then `path` is specifically `[0, 0, 0]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding 0 and `v`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` twice (which means `v` is simply removed). `n` must be at least 1, and `u` is assigned a value based on the function `func_1(d)`. Additionally, `v` was initially in `remaining_vertices` but is now removed from it.**
