To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `remaining_vertices` set. In each iteration, the loop tries to find a vertex `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set by calling `func_1(d)` for `d` ranging from `n-1` down to `0`. If `v` is found and is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the `path` list, and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations, it's clear that the loop is designed to add one unique vertex to the `path` list and remove it from `remaining_vertices` in each iteration. This pattern suggests that the loop will continue until all vertices have been added to the `path` list and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

Thus, after all iterations, `path` will contain all vertices from `1` to `n` in the order they were found and removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set.

Output State: **`path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**
