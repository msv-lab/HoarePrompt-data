Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves the control back to the start of the nearest enclosing loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the state remains unchanged.
