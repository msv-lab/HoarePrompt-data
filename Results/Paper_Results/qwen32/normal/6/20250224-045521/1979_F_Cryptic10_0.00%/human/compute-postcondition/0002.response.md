To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `while remaining_vertices:` evaluates to `True`. This means that the set `remaining_vertices` should not be empty.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.

The condition `while remaining_vertices:` will be `True` as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. Since `remaining_vertices` is initialized as a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, it will not be empty.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive**.
