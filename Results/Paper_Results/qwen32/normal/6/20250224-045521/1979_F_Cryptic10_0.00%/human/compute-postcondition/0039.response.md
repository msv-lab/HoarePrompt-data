The code snippet `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given the initial state, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, so after the removal, `v` will no longer be part of the set. The values of `u`, `path`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.**
