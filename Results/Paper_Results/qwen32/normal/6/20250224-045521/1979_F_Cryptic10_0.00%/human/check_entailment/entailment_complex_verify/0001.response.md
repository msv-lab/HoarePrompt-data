### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `path` as an empty list to store the vertices in the order of the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes `remaining_vertices` as a set containing all vertices from 1 to n. This is correct as it keeps track of the vertices that have not yet been included in the path.

2. **Querying Strategy**:
   - The program iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`. This strategy is intended to find a vertex with the highest possible degree first, which is a reasonable approach to efficiently find vertices that can connect to many other vertices.
   - For each degree `d`, it makes a query `? d` to find a vertex `v` with a degree at least `d` and a vertex `u` that is not connected to `v`. The query format and the response interpretation seem correct based on the problem description.
   - If `v` is non-zero, it adds `v` to the path and removes `v` from the set of remaining vertices. This ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and is removed from consideration.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty, meaning all vertices have been added to the path.
   - Once all vertices are included in the path, the program outputs the Hamiltonian path in the required format, prefixed by `!`.

### Analysis with Annotations:

- **Function `func_1(d)`**:
  - The function correctly prints the query `? d` and reads the response `v` and `u`.
  - It returns `v` and `u`, which are correctly interpreted as the vertex with degree at least `d` and a non-connected vertex, respectively.

- **Function `func_2(n)`**:
  - The function initializes `path` and `remaining_vertices` correctly.
  - The nested loop iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
  - For each degree, it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`.
  - If `v` is non-zero, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
  - The loop breaks after finding a valid vertex, ensuring that the program does not make unnecessary queries.
  - Once `remaining_vertices` is empty, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the correct format.

### Correctness Check:

- **Query Limit**: The program makes at most `n` queries for each test case, as it queries for each vertex once. This adheres to the problem constraint.
- **Vertex Selection**: The program correctly selects the vertex with the minimum degree and the minimum number among vertices with the same degree, as required by the problem statement.
- **Path Construction**: The program constructs a path that passes through each vertex exactly once, ensuring it is a Hamiltonian path.
- **Output Format**: The program outputs the Hamiltonian path in the correct format, prefixed by `!`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program adheres to the problem constraints and correctly finds a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries and following the required vertex selection strategy.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
