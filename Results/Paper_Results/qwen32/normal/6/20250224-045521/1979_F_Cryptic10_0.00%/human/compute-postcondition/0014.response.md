The only variable in the loop head is `d`. According to the loop statement, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be decremented by 1.

Given the initial conditions:
- `d` is `n - 1`.
- `v` is `0`.
- `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that `2 <= n <= 10^5`.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the single element `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from `1` to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

Since `d`, `v`, and `u` are not modified beyond the initial conditions, and the only variable we can adjust is `d`, we need to decrement `d` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5. `d` is n - 2, `v` is 0, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the single element `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
