The code snippet removes the value `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given the initial state, `v` is 0, but since `v` is supposed to be a vertex in the graph and vertices are integers from 1 to `n`, the precondition that `v` is 0 is not consistent with the rest of the initial state. However, for the sake of following the provided initial state and applying the code as is, we will assume the operation proceeds with `v` being 0, even though it is not a valid vertex in the context of the graph.

Since `v` is 0 and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, removing `v` from `remaining_vertices` does not change `remaining_vertices` because 0 is not an element of `remaining_vertices`.

Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the operation to remove `v` from `remaining_vertices` has no effect.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the single element `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.
