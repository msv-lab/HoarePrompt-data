Output State: **`v` is 0, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` (which is 0), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding the original `v` if `v` has been reassigned to a different value.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply passes control to the next iteration of the loop (or the next line if not inside a loop). Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
