Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 2; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. `path` now contains `v` as its last element if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The `path` list now includes `v` as its last element if `v` was in the `remaining_vertices` set. The other variables remain unchanged.
