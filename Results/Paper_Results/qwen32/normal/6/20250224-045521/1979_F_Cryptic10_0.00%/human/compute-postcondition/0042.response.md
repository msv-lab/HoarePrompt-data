The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we need to adjust only `d` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the loop statement, `d` starts from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `d` would have taken on a value that caused the loop to terminate (i.e., `d` was `-1`). To execute one more iteration, `d` must be set to the value it had at the start of the last iteration, which was `0` (since the loop decrements `d` by 1 in each iteration).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` should be set to `0`.

State: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, then `v` remains 0, `u` is unchanged, `path` still contains only `v`, and `remaining_vertices` remains the same. `d` is 0**
