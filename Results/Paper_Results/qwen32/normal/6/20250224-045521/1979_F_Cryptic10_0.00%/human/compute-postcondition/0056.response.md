Output State: **If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions regarding `v`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
