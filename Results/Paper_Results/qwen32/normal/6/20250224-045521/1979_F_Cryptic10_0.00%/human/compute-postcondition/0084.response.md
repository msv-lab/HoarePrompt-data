Output State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it; `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variables `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` retain their values as described in the initial state. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables.
