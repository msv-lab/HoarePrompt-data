The `while` loop condition is `while remaining_vertices:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not an empty set.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` (where `v` is the first vertex found in `remaining_vertices`).
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed because the condition `remaining_vertices` being non-empty is already satisfied based on the provided state.

State: **`path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.**
