You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. For each test case, there is one line containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Additionally, the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who have coins in their wallets. They take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current one and then remove one coin. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Optimal Play**: The players will play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
2. **Game Dynamics**: The game essentially revolves around the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the total number of coins is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring Bob is the one who runs out of moves first.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make the total even after her first move, putting Bob in the position of the even case.

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` and `else` statements are outside the loop. This means they will only execute after the loop has finished processing all test cases, which is incorrect. They should be inside the loop to handle each test case individually.
2. **Output Formatting**: The code prints "bob  " with an extra space, which does not match the expected output format. It should print "Bob" without any extra spaces.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the indentation error and the incorrect output formatting. The corrected version of the program should be used to determine the winner correctly based on the total number of coins.
