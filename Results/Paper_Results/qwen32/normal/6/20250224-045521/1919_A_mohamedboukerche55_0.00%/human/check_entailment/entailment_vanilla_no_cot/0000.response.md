Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` and `else` statements are incorrectly indented, causing them to be outside the loop. This means that the program only checks the last test case and prints the result `t` times.

2. **Incorrect Winner Determination Logic**: The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. According to the problem description, the winner should be determined based on the optimal play strategy, which is more complex than just checking the sum's parity.

To fix the program, we need to properly determine the winner based on the game rules. The correct strategy involves understanding that if `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins because Alice cannot force a win. If `a` and `b` are not equal, Alice can always force a win by ensuring she is the one to make the last move.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program reads the input correctly, processes each test case within the loop, and determines the winner based on the correct strategy.
