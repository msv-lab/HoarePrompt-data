Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]` ends, or `n - 1` if all elements are identical; `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is the count of consecutive identical elements at the end of the list; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`; `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`**
