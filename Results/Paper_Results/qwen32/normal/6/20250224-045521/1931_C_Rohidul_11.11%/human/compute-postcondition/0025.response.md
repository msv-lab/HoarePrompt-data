Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `l + 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first non-equal element is encountered.**
