The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`; `l` is such that `l < r` and `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]` (with `l` incremented by 1); `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**
