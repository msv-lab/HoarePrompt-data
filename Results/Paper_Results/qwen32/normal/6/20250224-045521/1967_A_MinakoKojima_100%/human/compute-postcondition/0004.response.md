The code snippet sorts the list `a`. Therefore, after sorting, `a` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list.**
