Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, and `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
