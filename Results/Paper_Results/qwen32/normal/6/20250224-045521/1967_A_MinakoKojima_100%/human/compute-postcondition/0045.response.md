The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is `t`, and `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100.

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which means the loop will not execute again if we do not adjust `i`. To make the loop execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value less than `n - 1`.

Given that `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make it `n - 2` so that the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`**
