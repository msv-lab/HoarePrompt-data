Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score based on the problem description. The logic for distributing the additional cards to maximize the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] is flawed. 

Here are some issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the `k` additional cards to maximize the number of permutations of length `n`. It simply tries to make the counts of each card type as equal as possible, but this does not necessarily maximize the number of permutations.

2. The calculation of `ans` and `res` does not correctly reflect the number of valid permutations. The formula `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res` does not correctly compute the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.

3. The program does not take into account that the optimal solution might involve more complex strategies for distributing the `k` additional cards, such as targeting specific card types to ensure that the counts of each card type are as close as possible to `n`.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue (or similar data structure) to iteratively distribute the `k` additional cards to maximize the number of valid permutations.
