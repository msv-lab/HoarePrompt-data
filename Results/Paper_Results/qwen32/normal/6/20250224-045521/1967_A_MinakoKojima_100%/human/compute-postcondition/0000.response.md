The given code snippet initializes an empty list `ans_list`. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remains unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12; `ans_list` is an empty list.**
