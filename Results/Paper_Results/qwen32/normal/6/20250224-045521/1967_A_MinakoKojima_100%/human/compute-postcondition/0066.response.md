The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding to it the product of `(ans - 1)` and `(n - 1)`. The values of `res` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0.
- `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n` to its previous value if `k` was not 0; otherwise, `res` remains 0.
- `k` is 0.

Since `k` is 0, `res` remains 0. The value of `ans` is adjusted as per the formula provided in the code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0.**
