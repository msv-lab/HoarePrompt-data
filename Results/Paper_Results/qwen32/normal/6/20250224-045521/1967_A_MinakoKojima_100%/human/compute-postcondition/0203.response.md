Output State: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0; `k` is 0 or the remaining amount; `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans` if `k` is not 0; `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `res` to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
