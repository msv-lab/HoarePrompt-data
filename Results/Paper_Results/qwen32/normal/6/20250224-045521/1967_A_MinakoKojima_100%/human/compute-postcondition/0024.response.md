Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `dif` is not 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. There are no consecutive equal elements in the list `a`.**
