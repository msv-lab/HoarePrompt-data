Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` if `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is `(n - 1) + k % (i + 1)` if `k < dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. The current difference between consecutive elements `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not 0. The loop or if statement is broken out of since `k` is 0.**
