Postcondition: **`ans` is the sum of `a[0]` and all `dif` values where `k` allowed, and if `k` is not 0, `ans` is further incremented by `k // n`. `res` is adjusted based on the number of non-zero `dif` values, and if `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % n`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans`. `n` and `a` remain unchanged.**
