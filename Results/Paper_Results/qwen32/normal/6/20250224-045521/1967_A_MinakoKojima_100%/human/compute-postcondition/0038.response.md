Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `ans + k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is `res + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, the `res` and `ans` values remain unchanged from their initial state.**
