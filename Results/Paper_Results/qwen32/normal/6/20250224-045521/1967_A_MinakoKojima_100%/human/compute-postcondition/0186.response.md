Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `a`, `ans_list` remain unchanged. If `dif` (which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain as per their previous states, with `ans` being incremented by `dif`. If `dif` was 0, `res` would have been decreased by 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
