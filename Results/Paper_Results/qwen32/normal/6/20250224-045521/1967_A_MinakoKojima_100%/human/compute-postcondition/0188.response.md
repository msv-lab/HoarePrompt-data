Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged. If `dif` (which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`**.

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
