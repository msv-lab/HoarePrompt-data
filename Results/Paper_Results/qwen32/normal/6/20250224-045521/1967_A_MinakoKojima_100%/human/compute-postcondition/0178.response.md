Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` are unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The loop or if statement we were in is terminated.
