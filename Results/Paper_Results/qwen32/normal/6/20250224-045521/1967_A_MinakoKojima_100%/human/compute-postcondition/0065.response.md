Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum possible value it can take based on the available `k` and the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0; `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n` to its previous value if `k` was not 0; `k` is 0. If `k` was 0, `ans` remains the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a` and `res` remains 0.**
