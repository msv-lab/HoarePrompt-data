The code snippet `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` based on its current value and the value of `n`. The other variables `res`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

To calculate the new value of `ans`, we use the expression:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + (\text{ans} - 1) \times (n - 1) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + \text{ans} \times (n - 1) - (n - 1) \]
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} \times n - (n - 1) \]

Output State: **`ans` is `ans * n - (n - 1)`, `res` is adjusted based on the number of non-zero `dif` values, and if `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % n`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans`. `n` and `a` remain unchanged.**
