Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly determines the winner of the game for all possible cases.

The provided program makes several incorrect assumptions and does not correctly implement the game logic. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect handling of the base case where `a == b`:**
   - The program simply prints "Bob" when `a == b`. However, if both players have the same number of coins, the game can still be won by the first player (Alice) if the number of coins is odd. This is because Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always swapping when the number of coins is odd.

2. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a == 1` or `b == 1`:**
   - The program prints "Alice" if `a == 1` and "Bob" if `b == 1`. However, if Alice has only one coin, she will lose because she cannot make a move after removing the coin. Conversely, if Bob has only one coin, Alice can take his coin and win.

3. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a % 2 == 1` (odd `a`):**
   - The program prints "Bob" when `a` is odd. However, if `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping when necessary.

4. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`:**
   - The program prints "Alice" when `a` is even and `b` is odd. However, Alice can only win if she can force Bob into a position where he has an odd number of coins and cannot make a move.

5. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a > b` and `a < b`:**
   - The program prints "Bob" if `a > b` and "Alice" if `a < b`. However, the winner depends on the parity (odd or even) of the coins and the optimal strategy, not just the relative sizes of `a` and `b`.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`):

- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This logic correctly handles all cases based on the total number of coins. Since the provided program does not correctly handle all cases, it is incorrect.
