Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and examples given. Let's analyze the problem more carefully:

1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - If both wallets have the same number of coins (`a == b`), the player to move first (Alice) can always mirror the other player's moves, ensuring that Bob will be the one to face a situation where he cannot make a move. Hence, Bob loses.
   - If one of the wallets has exactly 1 coin, the player with 1 coin will lose because they can only remove 1 coin, leaving the opponent with a non-empty wallet and no valid moves for themselves.
   - If both wallets have more than 1 coin, the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins in each wallet.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Alice can always swap and mirror Bob's moves, ensuring Bob loses.
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, Alice can also swap and mirror Bob's moves, ensuring Bob loses.
   - If `a` is odd and `b` is even (or vice versa), Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will eventually face a situation with two odd numbers of coins, leading to Bob's loss.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player with 1 coin loses.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd or both are even, Bob wins because Alice can always mirror Bob's moves.
   - If one is odd and the other is even, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

Given the above logic, the correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1 or b == 1:
            if a == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0) or (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1):
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The provided program has incorrect logic for determining the winner, particularly in handling the cases where one of the wallets has more than 1 coin and the other has exactly 1 coin, and in handling the parity of the coin counts. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
