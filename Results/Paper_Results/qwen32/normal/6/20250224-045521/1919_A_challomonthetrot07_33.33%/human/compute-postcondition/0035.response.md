The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('Bob')`. This statement directly outputs the string 'Bob' to the console. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `a`, `b`, `i`) and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely dependent on the string provided in the `print` function.

Output: **Bob**
