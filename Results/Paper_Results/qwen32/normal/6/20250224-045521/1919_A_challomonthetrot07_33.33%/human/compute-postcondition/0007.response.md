The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state provides information about variables `T`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string 'Alice' as specified.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `T` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer with the current value of 1, and `b` is an integer and is not equal to 1.
2. The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`, which directly outputs the string 'Alice' to the console.
3. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `T`, `a`, or `b`, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Alice**
