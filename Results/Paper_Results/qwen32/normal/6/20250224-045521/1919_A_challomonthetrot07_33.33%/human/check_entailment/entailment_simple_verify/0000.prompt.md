You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly determines the winner of the game for all possible cases.

The provided program makes several incorrect assumptions and does not correctly implement the game logic. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect handling of the base case where `a == b`:**
   - The program simply prints "Bob" when `a == b`. However, if both players have the same number of coins, the game can still be won by the first player (Alice) if the number of coins is odd. This is because Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always swapping when the number of coins is odd.

2. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a == 1` or `b == 1`:**
   - The program prints "Alice" if `a == 1` and "Bob" if `b == 1`. However, if Alice has only one coin, she will lose because she cannot make a move after removing the coin. Conversely, if Bob has only one coin, Alice can take his coin and win.

3. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a % 2 == 1` (odd `a`):**
   - The program prints "Bob" when `a` is odd. However, if `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping when necessary.

4. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`:**
   - The program prints "Alice" when `a` is even and `b` is odd. However, Alice can only win if she can force Bob into a position where he has an odd number of coins and cannot make a move.

5. **Incorrect handling of cases where `a > b` and `a < b`:**
   - The program prints "Bob" if `a > b` and "Alice" if `a < b`. However, the winner depends on the parity (odd or even) of the coins and the optimal strategy, not just the relative sizes of `a` and `b`.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`):

- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This logic correctly handles all cases based on the total number of coins. Since the provided program does not correctly handle all cases, it is incorrect.
