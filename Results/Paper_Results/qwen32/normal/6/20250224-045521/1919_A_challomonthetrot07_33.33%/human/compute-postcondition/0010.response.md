The `print('Bob')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `T`. It simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- The current value of `b` is 1.

However, these conditions do not affect the `print('Bob')` statement because it does not reference these variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Bob**
