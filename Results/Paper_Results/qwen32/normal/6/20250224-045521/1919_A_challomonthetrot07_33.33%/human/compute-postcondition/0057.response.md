Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` equals `b`, the actions specified in the if block are taken. Otherwise, if `a` equals 1 or `b` equals 1, the actions specified in the if block are taken. If neither `a` nor `b` equals 1 and `a` does not equal `b`, the actions specified in the else block are taken. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unspecified as it does not affect the postcondition.**
