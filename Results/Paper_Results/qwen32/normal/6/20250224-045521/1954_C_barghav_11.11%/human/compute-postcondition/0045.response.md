Let's break down the given information and the task step by step:

- **Initial State**:
  - The concatenation of all elements in `a` and `b` must be a list with at least 1 element.
  - `i` is 0.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print(b[i], end='')
  ```

**Analysis**:

1. **Concatenation Condition**: The concatenation of `a` and `b` must result in a list with at least one element. This implies that either `a` or `b` or both must have at least one element.
2. **Index `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.
3. **Print Statement**: The print statement `print(b[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of list `b` without adding a newline at the end.

Since `i` is 0, the print statement will output the first element of the list `b`. However, the exact value of the first element of `b` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `b`.

**Output**:

Output: **b[0] (where b[0] is the first element of the list b)**
