You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, where each digit is between 1 and 9, and rearranges their digits such that the first half of each resulting number consists of the maximum digits from the corresponding positions of `x` and `y`, while the second half consists of the minimum digits. It then prints the two rearranged numbers, each on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y` based on the given problem description. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to swap digits based on their positions relative to the midpoint of the number, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum product.

Let's consider an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example:
Input:
```
1
123
321
```

Expected Output:
```
321
123
```
Explanation: Swapping the digits between the two numbers will result in `321` and `123`, which gives a product of `321 * 123 = 39507`. This is the maximum possible product.

However, the provided program will output:
```
321
123
```
This is coincidentally correct for this example, but the logic is not generalizable. Let's consider another example:

### Another Example:
Input:
```
1
1234
4321
```

Expected Output:
```
4321
1234
```
Explanation: Swapping the digits between the two numbers will result in `4321` and `1234`, which gives a product of `4321 * 1234 = 9701814`. This is the maximum possible product.

However, the provided program will output:
```
4321
1234
```
Again, this is coincidentally correct for this example, but the logic is not generalizable. Let's consider a more complex example:

### Complex Example:
Input:
```
1
13579
97531
```

Expected Output:
```
97531
13579
```
Explanation: Swapping the digits between the two numbers will result in `97531` and `13579`, which gives a product of `97531 * 13579 = 1322323449`. This is the maximum possible product.

However, the provided program will output:
```
97531
13579
```
Again, this is coincidentally correct for this example, but the logic is not generalizable. Let's consider an example where the program will not work correctly:

### Incorrect Example:
Input:
```
1
19
91
```

Expected Output:
```
99
11
```
Explanation: Swapping the digits between the two numbers will result in `99` and `11`, which gives a product of `99 * 11 = 1089`. This is the maximum possible product.

However, the provided program will output:
```
91
19
```
This is incorrect because the product of `91 * 19 = 1729` is not the maximum possible product.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum product for all possible inputs. The logic needs to be revised to correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y`.
