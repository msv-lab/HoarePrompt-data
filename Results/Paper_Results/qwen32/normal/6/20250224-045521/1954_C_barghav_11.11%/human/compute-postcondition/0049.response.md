To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Given Initial State:
1. The concatenation of all elements in `a` and `b` must be a list with at least 1 element.
2. `i` is equal to 2.

### Analysis:
- We know that `a` and `b` are lists, and together they form a concatenated list with at least one element.
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The `print` statement is `print(b[i], end='')`, which means it will print the element at index `i` of list `b` without adding a newline at the end.

### Determining the Output:
- We need to find the value of `b[i]`, where `i` is 2. 
- However, the exact contents of list `b` are not provided, so we can't determine the specific value of `b[2]`.
- Given the precondition, we know that `b` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is 2, and indexing starts at 0).

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will output the element at index 2 of list `b`.
- Since the exact value of `b[2]` is not specified, we describe it in terms of the list `b`.

Output: **b[2] (where b is a list with at least 3 elements)**
