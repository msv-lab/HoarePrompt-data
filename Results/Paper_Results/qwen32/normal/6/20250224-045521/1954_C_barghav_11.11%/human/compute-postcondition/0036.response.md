To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the given information:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `b` is a list where the first half contains the minimum values and the second half contains the maximum values from the original `a` and `b` pairs.

2. **Code to be Executed**:
   - `print(a[i], end='')`

Here, `i` is a variable that is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without knowing `i`. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the value of `i`.

**Explanation**:
- The statement `print(a[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, without appending a newline character at the end.
- Since `a` is a list with at least one element, `a[i]` will be an element from this list. The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the value of `i`.

**Output**:
- The output will be the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

Given the lack of information about `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
