The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `b` must be a list with at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **the concatenation of all elements in `a`, `b` must be a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1**
