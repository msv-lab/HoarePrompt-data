Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; additionally, `x` and `y` have the same length for each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input and must have at least one character; `b` is a list of characters representing the new input; `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`**
