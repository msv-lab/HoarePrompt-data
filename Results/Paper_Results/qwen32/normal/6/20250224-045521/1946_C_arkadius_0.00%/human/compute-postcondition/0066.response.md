The code appends a new tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. This means that `stack` now has one more element than it did before. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged, but `stack` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `stack` (first element of the tuple), `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has one more element than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(v, True)`.**
