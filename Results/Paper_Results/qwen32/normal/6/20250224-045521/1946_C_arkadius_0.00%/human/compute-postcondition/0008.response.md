The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than 5.

State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, an edge is added to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `i` is 5**
