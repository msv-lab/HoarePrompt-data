Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be well-structured and follows a logical approach to solve the problem using binary search and tree traversal. However, there are a few potential issues that could cause it to fail in certain edge cases:

1. **Tree Rooting**: The tree is rooted at vertex 0, which is usually a reasonable choice, but the problem description does not specify a particular root. This could lead to issues if the tree structure is such that rooting at a different vertex would yield a different result. While the algorithm should theoretically work for any root, it's worth noting that the choice of root can affect the traversal order and potentially the results if not handled correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `n=1` or `k=0` explicitly. Although the problem constraints state `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`, it's good practice to consider these edge cases to ensure robustness.

3. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed using 0-based indexing (`u - 1, v - 1`), which is correct given the 1-based indexing in the input. However, if the input format changes or if there's an error in indexing, it could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation (`func_4`) is correct in terms of logic, but it's crucial to ensure that the `func_3` function accurately determines whether a given `x` is feasible. If `func_3` has any bugs or edge cases, it could affect the binary search results.

5. **Handling of Remaining Size**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions handle the remaining size and good components correctly, but it's important to ensure that the edge cases (e.g., when a component size is exactly `x`) are handled correctly.

To verify the correctness, we need to test the program with a variety of edge cases, including:

- Trees with only one vertex (`n=1`), which should trivially return `x=1` for any `k`.
- Trees with multiple components already present, where `k` is large enough to remove all edges.
- Trees with a large number of vertices and edges, testing the efficiency and correctness of the binary search and tree traversal.
- Trees with specific structures that might cause the rooting at vertex 0 to yield incorrect results.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need to handle various edge cases, it's challenging to be absolutely certain without thorough testing. However, the presence of potential issues in handling edge cases and the choice of root suggests that the program might not be fully correct for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness is **False** until proven otherwise through extensive testing.
