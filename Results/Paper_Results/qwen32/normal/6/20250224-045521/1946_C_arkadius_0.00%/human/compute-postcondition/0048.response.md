Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Other parts of the state remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1, in addition to the previous update of adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. The condition that `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x` remains valid. All other parts of the state remain unchanged.
