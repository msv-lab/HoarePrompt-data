### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to ensure the program meets the requirements.

1. **Tree Representation and Rooting**:
    - `TreeNode` class: Represents each node in the tree with attributes for edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
    - `Tree` class: Manages the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree (either recursively or non-recursively).

2. **Recursive and Non-Recursive Rooting**:
    - `root_tree`: Recursive method to root the tree at a given vertex.
    - `root_tree_non_recursive`: Non-recursive method to root the tree at a given vertex, which is used in the main function to avoid deep recursion issues.

3. **Component Calculation**:
    - `func_1`: Uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the component starting from a given vertex `s`. A good component is a connected sub-component with a size of at least `x`.
    - `func_2`: A recursive function that performs a post-order traversal to count the number of connected components of at least size `x` starting from a given vertex `v`.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
    - `func_3`: Determines if it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to make this determination.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
    - `func_4`: Implements a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining component of size at least `x`. It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each `x`.

6. **Main Function**:
    - `func_5`: Reads input for the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `k` to be removed. Constructs the tree, roots it at node 0, and then uses `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

### Verification:

- **Input Parsing**: `func_5` correctly reads the input for each test case.
- **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly with edges and then rooted at node 0.
- **Component Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size, which are used to check the feasibility of removing `k` edges.
- **Feasibility Check**: `func_3` correctly checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` correctly uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Given that all functions work together to solve the problem as described, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
