Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute; if `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True)]` followed by `n` elements of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is each child of `u1`, and `v` remains `u1`. If `postorder` is `True`, then `stack` remains `[(s, True)]` and `v` remains `u1`.**
