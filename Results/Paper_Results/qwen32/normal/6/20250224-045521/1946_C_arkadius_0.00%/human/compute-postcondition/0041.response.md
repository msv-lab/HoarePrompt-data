The code snippet appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack` list. This means that the `stack` will now have one additional element at the end. The other variables (`tree`, `v`, `postorder`, and `u`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[u1].children` must have at least one more element; `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True), (u, False), (u, False), (u, False)]`; `v` is `u1`; `postorder` is `False`; `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[u1].children`.**
