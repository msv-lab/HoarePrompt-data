Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute. If `postorder` is `True`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the initial value plus the sum of `good_components` of all children plus the count of children with `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the initial value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all children with `remaining_size` less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True)]` followed by `n` elements of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is each child of `u1`, and `v` remains `u1`.**
