Output State: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has three more elements than before, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged as they were part of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`. The `stack` now has three elements more than before, with the new last element being `(u, False)` and the second-to-last element being `(v, postorder)`. The conditions regarding `tree.vertices[v].children` and `u` remain the same.
