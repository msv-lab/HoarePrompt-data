You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a value based on the number of 0s and 1s in the string and prints this value. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a length between 2 and 200,000 characters, and the total length of all binary strings not exceeding 200,000 characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it solves the problem correctly.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to follow a specific logic to determine the minimum cost. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Counting Zeroes:** For each test case, it converts the string into a list of integers and counts the number of zeroes.
3. **Tracking Counts:** It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
4. **Calculating Cost:** It iterates through the string and updates the cost `ans` based on the counts of zeroes and ones:
   - If the current character is `0`, it adds `1` to the cost if there are any `1`s encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Logic Verification:
The logic used in the program seems to be based on the idea that:
- Each time we encounter a `0` after a `1`, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that `0` to the front of the sequence of `1`s. This is counted as `1` operation.
- Each time we encounter a `1`, we need to perform cyclic shifts for all remaining `0`s to bring them before this `1`. This is counted as the number of remaining `0`s.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost is the length of the substring being shifted, not just `1` or the number of remaining `0`s. The provided program does not correctly calculate the cost of the cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
