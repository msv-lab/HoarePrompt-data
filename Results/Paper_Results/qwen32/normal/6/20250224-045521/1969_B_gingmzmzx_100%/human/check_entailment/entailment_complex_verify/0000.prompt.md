You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5 and the sum of lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final `ans` value calculated from the last binary string `s` read in the `n`-th iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a value based on the number of 0s and 1s in the string and prints this value. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a length between 2 and 200,000 characters, and the total length of all binary strings not exceeding 200,000 characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the cyclic shift operation.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The code attempts to calculate the cost by iterating through the string and checking the number of 0s and 1s, but it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclically shifting substrings to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Logic Flaw:** The code logic seems to be based on counting the number of inversions or transitions between 0s and 1s, but it does not correctly map this to the cost of cyclic shifts. For example, in the string "101011", the code might count the number of 1s before a 0 and add to the cost, but this does not reflect the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Example where the Code Fails:
Consider the input string "101011". The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code does not compute this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider the following:
- Identify the longest prefix of the string that is already sorted.
- Determine the number of cyclic shifts required to bring all 0s to the beginning and all 1s to the end.
- Calculate the cost of these shifts based on the length of the substrings being shifted.

Given the complexity of the problem, a more detailed and correct implementation would be required. The provided code does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
