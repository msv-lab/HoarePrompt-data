In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop runs `n` times, and since `_` is not used within the loop, the only variable that could be relevant to the continuation of the loop based on the provided information is `n`.

However, since `n` is the controlling factor for the number of iterations and does not change within the loop, we only need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time by decrementing the implicit iteration counter (which is not explicitly shown but is controlled by `n`).

Given that the loop runs `n` times, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`cnt` is `[total number of 0s, total number of 1s]`, `ans` is the total score calculated based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1**.

Since `n` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted and it controls the number of iterations, we adjust `n` accordingly. The states of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their adjustments would depend on the loop body, which is omitted.
