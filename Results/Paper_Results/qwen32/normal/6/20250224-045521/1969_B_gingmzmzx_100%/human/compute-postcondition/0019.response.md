The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the second-to-last element in the list `s` and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with the count of `c` incremented by 1, the value of `cnt` will change based on the value of `c`.

- If `c` is `0`, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is `1`, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`; `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 2]` if `c` is 1; `c` is the second-to-last element in the list `s`; `ans` is unchanged.**
