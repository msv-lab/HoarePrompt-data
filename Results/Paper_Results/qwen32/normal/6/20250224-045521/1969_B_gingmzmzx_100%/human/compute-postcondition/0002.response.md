Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the binary string input. Each character in the binary string is converted to an integer (0 or 1). The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
