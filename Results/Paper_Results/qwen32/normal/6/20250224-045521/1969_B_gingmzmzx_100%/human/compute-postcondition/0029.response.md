The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This affects the value of `ans` directly, while the other variables (`cnt`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`.**
