Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`; `c` is the next element in `s`.**
