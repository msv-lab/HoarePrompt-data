The code snippet `t = b * 2` updates the value of `t` to be twice the value of `b`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `t1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `(b * 2)` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is `b * 2`**.
