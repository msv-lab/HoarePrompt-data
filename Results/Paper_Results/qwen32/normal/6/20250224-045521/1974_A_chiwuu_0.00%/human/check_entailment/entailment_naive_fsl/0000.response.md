Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens required by first placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons. However, the way it handles the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
14 1
```
Here, there are 14 applications with 1x1 icons and 1 application with a 2x2 icon.

The correct approach would be to place the 2x2 icon first, which occupies 4 cells. This leaves 11 cells available on the first screen. The remaining 14 - 11 = 3 1x1 icons can fit on the first screen as well, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the correct answer is 1 screen.

However, the given program calculates:
- `t = b * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`
- `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (since 2 is not divisible by 5)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 15 - 4 = 11`
- Since `t1 >= a` is not true (11 < 14), it calculates:
  - `t2 = a - t1 = 14 - 11 = 3`
  - `t = 1 + 3 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (since 3 is not divisible by 15)

Thus, the program outputs 2 screens for this test case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases properly, and the Correctness is **False**.
