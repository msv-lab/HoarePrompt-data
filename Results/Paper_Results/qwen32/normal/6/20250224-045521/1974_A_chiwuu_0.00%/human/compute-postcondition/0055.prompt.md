Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `(b * 2)` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, the program retains the initial conditions of `t`. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `(b * 2) // 5 + t2 // 15` if `t % 5 == 0`, or `(b * 2) // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15` otherwise. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a + b * 4 - t * 15) // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
