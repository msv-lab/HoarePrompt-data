Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and inefficiencies that can lead to incorrect results. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Initial Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (which is incorrect) and then dividing by 5. This calculation does not accurately account for the space occupied by 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space (`t1`) after placing the 2x2 icons but does so incorrectly. It assumes that each screen has 15 cells and subtracts the space occupied by 2x2 icons. However, this does not account for the fact that 2x2 icons occupy specific patterns on the grid, which can leave varying amounts of space for 1x1 icons.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Calculation for Additional Screens**:
   - The program calculates the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons by checking if the remaining space is divisible by 15. This is incorrect because 1x1 icons can be placed in any remaining space, not just in full screens.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        while b > 0:
            if b >= 2 and a >= 2:
                # Place two 2x2 icons in a 5x3 grid
                screens += 1
                b -= 2
                a -= 2
            elif b >= 1:
                # Place one 2x2 icon in a 5x3 grid
                screens += 1
                b -= 1
                a -= 4
            else:
                break
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if a > 0:
            screens += (a + 14) // 15  # Equivalent to math.ceil(a / 15)
        
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected program places the 2x2 icons first, ensuring they are placed optimally, and then places the remaining 1x1 icons in the available space. The calculation of additional screens for 1x1 icons is done correctly using the ceiling function equivalent.
