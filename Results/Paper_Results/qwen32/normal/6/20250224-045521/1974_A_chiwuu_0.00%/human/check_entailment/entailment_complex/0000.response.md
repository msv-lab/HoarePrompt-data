### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens:**
   - First, it calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, `b` 2x2 icons will occupy `4*b` cells.
   - The number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is then calculated as `t = b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2 % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t = b * 2 // 5 + 1`. This is because each screen can hold up to 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, which means 2 2x2 icons can fit in a screen (8 cells used, 7 cells left).
   - It then calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells (`t1`) are sufficient to place the 1x1 icons (`a`), then `t` screens are sufficient. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed, otherwise `t2 // 15 + 1` screens are needed.
   - Finally, it prints the total number of screens required.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems correct for the given examples. For instance, if `a = 7` and `b = 2`, the program correctly calculates that 1 screen is needed. If `a = 12` and `b = 4`, it correctly calculates that 2 screens are needed.
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no icons (`a = 0` and `b = 0`), when there are only 1x1 icons, and when there are only 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and comparing it with the problem description and examples, the program appears to be correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
