You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The code calculates the number of screens required to place `b` 2x2 icons.
   - Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3), the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`) is calculated as:
     - `t = b * 2` (each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, which is 2 units of 2 cells each)
     - If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5.
     - If `t` is not divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5 and then rounded up by adding 1.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the minimum number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The code calculates the remaining space available after placing the 2x2 icons:
     - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
     - `t1` represents the remaining number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Calculating Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is not sufficient, the code calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`).
   - The additional screens required are then calculated:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct, but the logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons is incorrect. The calculation for `t1` and the logic to determine additional screens for 1x1 icons is flawed.

For example, consider the test case `12 4` (12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons):
- The 4 2x2 icons will occupy 16 cells (4 * 4 = 16), which requires 2 screens (since 16 cells > 15 cells per screen).
- After placing the 2x2 icons, there are 14 cells left in the 2 screens (2 * 15 - 16 = 14).
- The remaining 12 1x1 icons can fit into these 14 cells, so no additional screens are needed.
- The program, however, might incorrectly calculate the number of additional screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
