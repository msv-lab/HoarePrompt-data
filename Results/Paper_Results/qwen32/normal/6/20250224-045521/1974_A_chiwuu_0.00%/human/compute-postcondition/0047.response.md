The given code snippet updates the value of `t1` based on the current value of `t` and `b`. The previous value of `t1` is recalculated to be `t * 15 - b * 4`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is `(b * 2) // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.**
