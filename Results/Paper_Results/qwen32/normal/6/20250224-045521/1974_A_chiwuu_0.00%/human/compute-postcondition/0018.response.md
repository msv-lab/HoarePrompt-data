Postcondition: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input; `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is equal to `a - t1`; `t2` is not divisible by 15.**
