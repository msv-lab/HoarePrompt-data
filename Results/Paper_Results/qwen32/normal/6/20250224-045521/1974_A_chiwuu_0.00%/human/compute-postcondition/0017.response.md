Output State: **`t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15`; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input; `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, and `t2` is divisible by 15.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been updated to `t + t2 // 15`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their previous values and conditions.
