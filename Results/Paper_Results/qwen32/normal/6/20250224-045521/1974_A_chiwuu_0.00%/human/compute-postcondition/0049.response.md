Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is `(b * 2) // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `t2` is calculated as `a` minus `t1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is determined based on whether `t % 5 == 0` or not, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
