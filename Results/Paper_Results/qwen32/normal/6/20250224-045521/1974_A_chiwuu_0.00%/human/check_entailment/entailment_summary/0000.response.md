To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it computes the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons as described in the problem.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `b * 2` which seems to be an incorrect approach to determine the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Instead, it should be calculated based on how many 2x2 icons can fit into a 5x3 grid.
   - It then checks if `t % 5 == 0` to determine if the number of 2x2 icons can perfectly fill rows of a screen. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual arrangement of 2x2 icons on the grid.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining Space**:
   - The program calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is flawed.
   - It then checks if the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates `t2` as the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed and adjusts `t` accordingly.

The program's logic does not correctly account for the arrangement of icons on the grid. For example, a 5x3 grid can accommodate a maximum of 3 2x2 icons (placed in a way that they do not overlap and fit within the grid), and the remaining space can be filled with 1x1 icons.

Let's consider a correct approach:
- First, place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the grid. Since a 5x3 grid can fit 3 2x2 icons, we should place up to 3 2x2 icons per screen.
- Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons and fill it with 1x1 icons.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens required and hence is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
