To determine the output of the `print(t)` statement, we need to carefully follow the logic described in the initial state and see how the value of `t` is determined.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer.
   - `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then:
     - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `t` after the above logic is what will be printed.

To explain the final value of `t` in terms of the initial conditions:

- **Case 1**: If `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
- **Case 2**: If `t1` is less than `a`, then:
  - `t2` is `a - t1`, which is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
  - `t` is then adjusted based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not:
    - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`.
    - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the final value of `t` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and the initial `t`.

Output: **t (where t is adjusted based on the values of a, b, and the initial t as described in the initial state and logic)**
