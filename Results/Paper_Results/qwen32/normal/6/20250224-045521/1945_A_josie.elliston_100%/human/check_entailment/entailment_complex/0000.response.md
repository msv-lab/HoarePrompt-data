### Reasoning:

The provided code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** To determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, given that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - **Logic:**
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts according to their preferences.
     - If the sum is at least 3, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed by taking the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3.
   - **Correctness:** This logic correctly handles the cases where extroverts need to be in groups of three and universals can fill in the remaining spots. If there aren't enough universals to complete the groups, it correctly identifies the impossibility by returning `None`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** To calculate the total number of tents needed, considering both introverts and the result from `func_1`.
   - **Logic:**
     - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts, so it returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing a tent alone) to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents required.
   - **Correctness:** This logic correctly combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts, ensuring that all participants are accommodated according to their preferences or correctly identifies when it's impossible.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. They handle all edge cases, including when it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
