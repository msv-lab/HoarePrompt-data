To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition checks whether the second element of the tuple `e` (which is obtained by `heappop(min_heap)`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[i]` is `2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2`
- `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)` and an additional element `(x, 0)` where `x` is any value
- `d` is less than `len(row)`
- `i` is `d + 2`

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the second element of the tuple `e` popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `min_heap` contains `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)` and `(x, 0)`.
- For the loop to execute again, the next element popped from `min_heap` must satisfy the condition `[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Adjustment:
- The next element popped from `min_heap` could be `(x, 0)`.
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that `0 <= i - (d + 2)`.
- Since `i` is `d + 2`, `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `0`.

Therefore, the condition `0 <= 0` is always true, and the loop can execute one more time if `(x, 0)` is the next element popped from `min_heap`.

### Final State:
No other adjustments are needed since the condition is already satisfied with the current state of `min_heap`.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` is `2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2`, `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)` and an additional element `(x, 0)` where `x` is any value, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 2`**
