To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `e` (after the assignment inside the loop condition) and `i`.

The loop condition is:
```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

This means the loop will continue as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (which is `e[1]` after the assignment) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Let's analyze the current state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `row[0]` is 1.
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`.
- `min_heap` is `[e, (row[d], d)]`.
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`.
- `i` is `d + 1`.

Since `i` is `d + 1`, let's substitute `i` in the loop condition:
```python
e[1] <= (d + 1) - (d + 2)
e[1] <= -1
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `-1`. Since `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, we need to ensure that the second element of the tuple at the top of `min_heap` satisfies this condition.

Given that `min_heap` is `[e, (row[d], d)]`, the next element to be popped from the heap will be either `e` or `(row[d], d)`. To ensure the loop condition is met, we need to make sure that the second element of the tuple that gets popped is less than or equal to `-1`.

Since `e` is already part of the heap and its second element has already been used in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `(row[d], d)` satisfies the condition:
```python
d <= -1
```

However, `d` is a non-negative index (as it is used to index `row`), so `d` cannot be less than or equal to `-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `e` (the next element popped from the heap) has its second element less than or equal to `-1`.

Thus, we need to adjust `min_heap` such that the next element popped has its second element less than or equal to `-1`.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**
