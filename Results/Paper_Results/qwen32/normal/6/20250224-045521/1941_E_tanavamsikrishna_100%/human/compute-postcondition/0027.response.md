To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition:

```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
1. `min_heap`: The heap from which elements are popped.
2. `e[1]`: The second element of the tuple `e` popped from `min_heap`.
3. `i`: The current value of `i`.
4. `d`: The current value of `d`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1.
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`.
- `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1`.
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`.
- `i` is `d + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need:
- `min_heap` to still have an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1` after popping.
- The condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` to be true.

Let's break down the condition:
- `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `d + 1 - (d + 2) = -1`.
- Therefore, the condition becomes `e[1] <= -1`.

Since `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1` and we are popping from it, we need to ensure that after popping, `min_heap` still has an element that satisfies `y <= -1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`min_heap`**: Ensure that after popping, `min_heap` still has an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1`. This means `min_heap` should have at least two elements where the second element of at least one of them is `<= -1`.
- **`i` and `d`**: These values do not need adjustment as they are derived from the loop's logic and the state provided.

### Final State:
State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` must have at least two elements where the second element of at least one of them is `<= -1`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**
