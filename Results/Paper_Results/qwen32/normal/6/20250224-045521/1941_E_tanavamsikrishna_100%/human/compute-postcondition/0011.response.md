To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the operations performed on the variables:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `n`: A positive integer representing the number of rows in `rows`.
   - `m`: A positive integer representing the number of integers in each row of `rows`.
   - `k`: A positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, representing the number of consecutive elements to sum in `costs`.
   - `d`: A positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, used as an argument in the function `func_1`.
   - `rows`: A 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers.
   - `costs`: A list of `n` elements where each element is the result of applying the function `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.
   - `total_costs`: A list containing `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

2. **Operations:**
   - For each row in `rows`, `func_1(row, d)` is applied to compute the corresponding element in `costs`.
   - For each possible set of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, their sum is computed to form the elements of `total_costs`.

3. **Output Statement:**
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: This statement prints the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

Since the exact values of `rows`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `costs` and `total_costs`. However, we can describe the printed output in terms of the given conditions and operations.

**Output Explanation:**
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the list `total_costs`, which contains the sums of all possible sets of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list. Each element in `costs` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to a row in `rows` and the integer `d`.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements in costs, and costs is a list where each element is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and the integer d)**
