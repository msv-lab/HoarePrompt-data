Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and a parameter `d`, which is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function returns the final computed value of `row[-1]`, which is determined by summing the previous `row[i]` and the first element in `min_heap` that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)` for each `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.**
