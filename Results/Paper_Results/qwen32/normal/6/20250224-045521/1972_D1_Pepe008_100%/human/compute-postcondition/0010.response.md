The given code snippet is:
```
suma += 1
```

This line increments the value of the variable `suma` by 1. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the value of `suma` changes from `x` to `x + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `x + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**
