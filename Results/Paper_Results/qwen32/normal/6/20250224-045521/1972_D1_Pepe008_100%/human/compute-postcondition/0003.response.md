The code snippet converts the first and second elements of the list `info` to integers and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables (`t` and `T`) and the list `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is greater than or equal to 1; `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
