Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The given program, however, uses a different formula and logic that does not align with the problem's requirements. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the conditions used in the program do not correspond to the problem's constraints and conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` holds. The provided program does not do this and instead uses a different logic that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
