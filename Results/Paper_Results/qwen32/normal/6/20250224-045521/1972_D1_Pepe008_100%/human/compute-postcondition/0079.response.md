To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it:
1. Takes two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
2. Initializes `suma` to 0.
3. Iterates `b` times, computing `x` and possibly adding it to `suma` based on certain conditions.
4. Prints `suma - 2`.

### Given Information
- **After 1 iteration**: The loop executed once, which means `T` is at least 1. The initial state of `suma` is 0 and `b` is at least 1.
- **After 2 iterations**: `suma` is 15 after the second iteration.
- **After 3 iterations**: The final value of `suma` after all iterations is determined by the sum of `x` and any additional increments based on the conditions.

### Calculation of Final Output State

Let's assume the values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are as follows (these are hypothetical values to illustrate the calculation):

#### Iteration 1:
- Let's assume `a = 10` and `b = 5`
- Calculate `suma` for each `i` from 1 to 5.

#### Iteration 2:
- Let's assume `a = 15` and `b = 4`
- Calculate `suma` for each `i` from 1 to 4.
- `suma` is 15 after this iteration.

#### Iteration 3:
- Let's assume `a = 20` and `b = 3`
- Calculate `suma` for each `i` from 1 to 3.

### Hypothetical Calculation

#### Iteration 1:
- `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- For `i = 1`: `x = (10 - 1*0) // 1^2 + 1 = 11`, `suma += 11` → `suma = 11`
- For `i = 2`: `x = (10 - 2*1) // 2^2 + 1 = 4`, `suma += 4` → `suma = 15`
- For `i = 3`: `x = (10 - 3*2) // 3^2 + 1 = 1`, `suma += 1` → `suma = 16`
- For `i = 4`: `x = (10 - 4*3) // 4^2 + 1 = -1`, `suma` remains 16
- For `i = 5`: `x = (10 - 5*4) // 5^2 + 1 = -3`, `suma` remains 16
- `print(suma - 2) = 14`

#### Iteration 2:
- `a = 15`, `b = 4`
- For `i = 1`: `x = (15 - 1*0) // 1^2 + 1 = 16`, `suma += 16` → `suma = 16`
- For `i = 2`: `x = (15 - 2*1) // 2^2 + 1 = 5`, `suma += 5` → `suma = 21`
- For `i = 3`: `x = (15 - 3*2) // 3^2 + 1 = 2`, `suma += 2` → `suma = 23`
- For `i = 4`: `x = (15 - 4*3) // 4^2 + 1 = 0`, `suma` remains 23
- `print(suma - 2) = 21`

#### Iteration 3:
- `a = 20`, `b = 3`
- For `i = 1`: `x = (20 - 1*0) // 1^2 + 1 = 21`, `suma += 21` → `suma = 21`
- For `i = 2`: `x = (20 - 2*1) // 2^2 + 1 = 6`, `suma += 6` → `suma = 27`
- For `i = 3`: `x = (20 - 3*2) // 3^2 + 1 = 3`, `suma += 3` → `suma = 30`
- `print(suma - 2) = 28`

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the final output is the sum of all printed values.

- Iteration 1: 14
- Iteration 2: 21
- Iteration 3: 28

**Total Output**: 14 + 21 + 28 = 63

Thus, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **63**.

This means that after all iterations, the total printed sum is 63.
