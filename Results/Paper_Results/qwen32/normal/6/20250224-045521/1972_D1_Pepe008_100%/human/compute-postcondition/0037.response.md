Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is 3, and `suma` is 4 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, `suma` remains 3.**
