The given for loop is:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range function is defined by the start value `1` and the stop value `b + 1`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, b + 1)` is non-empty, which means `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `T` is greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`
- `suma` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `b`. Since `b` is already defined as the integer value of `info[1]`, we need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state of `b` must be adjusted to ensure it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0**
