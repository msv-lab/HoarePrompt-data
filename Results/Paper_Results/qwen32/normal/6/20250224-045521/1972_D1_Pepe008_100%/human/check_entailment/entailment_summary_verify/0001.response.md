### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem but seems to use an incorrect approach. Let's break down the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

1. **Loop Over \(b\)**: The program iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). Here, \(i\) corresponds to the value of \(b\) in the problem statement.
2. **Calculation of \(x\)**: The value of \(x\) is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). This formula does not seem to correctly represent the problem's conditions.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if \(x\) is positive and adds it to `suma`. It also checks specific modulo conditions to add an extra 1 to `suma`.
4. **Final Output**: The program prints `suma - 2`, which is arbitrary and not explained by the logic.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The formula for calculating `x` and the conditions used to update `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end is arbitrary and not justified by the logic.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an optimized approach is necessary.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the described logic and conditions. The logic inside the loop and the way `suma` is calculated and adjusted do not match the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
