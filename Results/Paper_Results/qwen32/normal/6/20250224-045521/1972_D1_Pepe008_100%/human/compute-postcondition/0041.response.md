The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the current value of `x` to it. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`.**
