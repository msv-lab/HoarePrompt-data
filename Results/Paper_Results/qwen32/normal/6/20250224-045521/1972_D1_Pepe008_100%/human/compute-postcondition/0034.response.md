The given code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given that `suma` was initially 0 and `x` is 3, after the execution of the code, `suma` will be 3. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `suma` is 3, `x` is 3.**
