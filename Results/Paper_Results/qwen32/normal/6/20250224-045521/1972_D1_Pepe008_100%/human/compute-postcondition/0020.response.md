Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

The value of `x` is calculated based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, where `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial stated values.
