The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the variable `suma`. 

Initial State: 
- `suma` is 0
- `t` is `n + 1`
- `T` must be greater than `n + 1`
- `info` is a list of strings from the input
- `a` is `int(info[0])`
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`

After executing the line `suma += x`, the value of `suma` will be `0 + x`, which simplifies to `x`.

Output State: **`suma` is `x`, `t` is `n + 1`, `T` must be greater than `n + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**.
