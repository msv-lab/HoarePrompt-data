### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Counting Pairs**:
    - The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
    - For each \(b\), it calculates a value \(x\) and adds it to the sum `suma`.
    - The calculation of `x` is based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), which does not directly relate to the problem's condition.
    - The program also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \mod i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \mod i ** 2 == 0\) to add an additional 1 to `suma`. This condition is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Output Adjustment**:
    - The final result is printed as `suma - 2`. This adjustment seems arbitrary and does not logically follow from the calculations performed.

3. **Correct Approach**:
    - To correctly solve the problem, one needs to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
    - This can be done using nested loops for \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic and calculations in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
