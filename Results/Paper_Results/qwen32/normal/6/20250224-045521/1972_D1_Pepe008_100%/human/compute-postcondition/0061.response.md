Postcondition: **`suma` is `x`, `t` is `n + 1`, `T` must be greater than `n + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and it holds that `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0)`**
