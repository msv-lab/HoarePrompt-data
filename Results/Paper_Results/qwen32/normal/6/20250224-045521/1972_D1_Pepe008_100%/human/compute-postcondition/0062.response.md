The code snippet provided is `suma += 1`, which increments the value of `suma` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `suma` is `x`
- `t` is `n + 1`
- `T` must be greater than `n + 1`
- `info` is a list of strings from the input
- `a` is `int(info[0])`
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
- `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i` (This condition seems to be incomplete, but it doesn't affect the current operation)

Since `suma` is initially `x`, after executing `suma += 1`, `suma` becomes `x + 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`suma` is `x + 1`, `t` is `n + 1`, `T` must be greater than `n + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
