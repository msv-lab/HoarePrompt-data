Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was originally greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 1; `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' if `res` was incremented.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
