The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, and `i` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` > 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1. `res` is incremented by 1.**
