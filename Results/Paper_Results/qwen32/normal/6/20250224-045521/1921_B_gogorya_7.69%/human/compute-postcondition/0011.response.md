Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` - 1; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The current value of `hd` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language: The value of `hd` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `hd` is still non-negative.
