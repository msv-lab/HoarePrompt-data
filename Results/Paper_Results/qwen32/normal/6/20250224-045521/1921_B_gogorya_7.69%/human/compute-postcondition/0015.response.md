Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. At the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, and `hd` is decreased by 1. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
