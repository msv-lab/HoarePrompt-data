Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, so `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
