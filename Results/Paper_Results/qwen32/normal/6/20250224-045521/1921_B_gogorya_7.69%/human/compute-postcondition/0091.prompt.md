Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is 0 if `a1 - a2` iterations have occurred where `hd` was greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the count of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s1` and `s2` are the input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `max(0, a1 - a2 - n)`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the number of times `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `s1` and `s2` are the input strings
- `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`
- `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`
- `hd` is `max(0, a1 - a2 - n)`
- `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + count_of('1' in s1 and '0' in s2 over n iterations)`

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `hd` is reduced by `n` but not below 0, and `res` is increased by the number of times a '1' in `s1` matches a '0' in `s2` over `n` iterations.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
