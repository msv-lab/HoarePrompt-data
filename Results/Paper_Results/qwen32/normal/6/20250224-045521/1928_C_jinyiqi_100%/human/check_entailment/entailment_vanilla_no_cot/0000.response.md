Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to return all divisors of `x`, but it returns them in the wrong order and with duplicates. Specifically, it combines `output2` and `output1` in a way that doesn't guarantee the correct order and might include duplicates. This could lead to incorrect results when checking for valid `k` values.

2. The main loop in the program uses the results from `func_1` to determine valid `k` values. However, the logic for checking if a divisor corresponds to a valid `k` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` is unnecessary and incorrect for determining if `k` is valid. The correct condition should be that `(s + 2) / 2` should be an integer and should be greater than or equal to `x`.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where `n - x` or `n + x - 2` is less than or equal to 0, which could happen for some inputs.

4. The program does not correctly handle the condition that `k` must be greater than 1.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly compute all divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`, check if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x`, and ensure that `k` is greater than 1. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    valid_k = set()
    if n - x > 0:
        for s in find_divisors(n - x):
            k = (s + 2) // 2
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and k >= x and k > 1:
                valid_k.add(k)
    if n + x - 2 > 0:
        for s in find_divisors(n + x - 2):
            k = (s + 2) // 2
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and k >= x and k > 1:
                valid_k.add(k)
    print(len(valid_k))
```

This corrected version properly computes the divisors, checks the conditions for valid `k`, and ensures that `k` is greater than 1.
