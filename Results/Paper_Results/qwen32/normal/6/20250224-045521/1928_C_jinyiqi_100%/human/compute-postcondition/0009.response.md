The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. Given that `i` is 2 and `x` is at least 4, the integer division `x / i` will be at least 2. Therefore, the new element added to `output2` will be an integer that is at least 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is at least 4, `output1` contains the elements [1, 2], and `output2` contains the elements `x` and `int(x / 2)`.**
