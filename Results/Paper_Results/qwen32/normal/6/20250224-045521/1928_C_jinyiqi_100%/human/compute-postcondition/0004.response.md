Initial State: `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.

The code snippet `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is at least 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`; `output1` contains the element 1.**
