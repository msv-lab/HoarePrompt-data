Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The logic in the function `func_1` is designed to find if there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only two invitations are needed to bring both friends to the party. However, if no such pair is found, it incorrectly prints `3` without considering other possible configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will print `3` because there are no pairs of friends who are best friends with each other. However, the correct answer is `2` because Monocarp can send invitations to friends `1` and `2`, and both will come to the party because friend `1`'s best friend is `2` and friend `2`'s best friend is `3`, but since `2` is invited, `1` will come, and similarly, `2` will come because `1` is invited.

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle all cases by checking all possible configurations of invitations to ensure that the minimum number of invitations required to bring at least 2 friends to the party is calculated.
