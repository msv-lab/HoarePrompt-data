The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`.**
