Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` equals `i`.**
