### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to distribute the bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. If the i-th outcome wins, you receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome. The total bet should be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves to compute the LCM of two numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of outcomes `N` and a list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all elements in `vals` and assigns it to `den`.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element `vprod[i]` is `den // vals[i]`.
   - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den` and checks if the result is greater than zero.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets.

#### Verification:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is a common divisor of all possible winnings (`k_i * vprod[i]`).
- **Sum Check**: By subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `den`, we ensure that the remaining `den` is positive, which means the total bet is less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
- **Output**: If `den` is positive, the bets `vprod` are valid because `den` is the common divisor, and each `k_i * vprod[i]` will be greater than `sum(vprod)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, when used together, correctly solve the problem as described. They ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome, and they handle the edge cases appropriately by returning `-1` when no valid distribution is possible.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
