### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements.

**Problem Requirements:**
- We need to distribute coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome, i.e., for each \( i \), \( \sum x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \).

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and stores it in `den`.
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as space-separated values.

**Evaluation of Function `func_2()`**:
- The approach taken by the function is to use the LCM of the multipliers to distribute the bets. However, this method does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
- The function calculates `vprod` such that the total bet is the LCM of the multipliers. For each outcome \( i \), the bet \( x_i \) is \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \). The total bet is the LCM.
- To satisfy the condition \( \sum x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \), we need \( \text{LCM} < k_i \cdot \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \), which simplifies to \( \text{LCM} < \text{LCM} \), which is always false. Therefore, the function does not ensure the required condition.

**Example Analysis:**
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 4
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  A valid output could be something like:
  ```
  1 1 2
  ```
  Here, the total bet is \( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \), and for each winning outcome:
  - If the first outcome wins, the received amount is \( 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \), which is not greater than 4.
  - If the second outcome wins, the received amount is \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \), which is not greater than 4.
  - If the third outcome wins, the received amount is \( 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \), which is greater than 4.
- **Incorrect Output from the Provided Code:**
  For the input `1 3 2 3 4`, the provided code might output something like `2 3 4` which does not satisfy the condition for all winning outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The function `func_2()` does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

**Final: False**
