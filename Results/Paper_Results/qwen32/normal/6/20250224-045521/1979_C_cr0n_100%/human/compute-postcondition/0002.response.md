The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `vals` to the variable `den`. Therefore, `den` will take the value of `vals[0]`. The other variables `N` and `vals` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes; `vals` is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and each element in `vals` is an integer such that 2 <= vals[i] <= 20; `den` is `vals[0]`.**
