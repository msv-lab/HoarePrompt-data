To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **N**: An integer representing the number of outcomes.
2. **vals**: A list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.
3. **den**: Initially set to `vals[0]` and then iteratively updated by applying `func_1` to the current `den` and each subsequent element in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
4. **vprod**: A list of integers where each element is the result of `den // r` for `r` in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `den` is initialized to `vals[0]`.
2. **vprod Calculation**: `vprod` is calculated by iterating over each element `r` in `vals` and performing the integer division `den // r`. The result of each division is appended to `vprod`.
3. **den Update**: After calculating `vprod`, `den` is updated by applying `func_1` to the current `den` and each subsequent element in `vals`, minus the sum of `vprod`. However, the exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we will focus on the `vprod` list.
4. **Printing**: The code snippet prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

### Output Description:
The output will be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is the result of the integer division `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `vals` and the initial `den` (which is `vals[0]`) are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `vprod`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `vprod`.

Output: **[space-separated values of vprod] (where each value is the result of den // r for r in vals)**

To make it more precise, if we assume hypothetical values for `vals` and `den`, we can illustrate. For example, if `vals = [10, 2, 5]` and `den = 10`, then `vprod` would be calculated as follows:
- `vprod[0] = den // vals[0] = 10 // 10 = 1`
- `vprod[1] = den // vals[1] = 10 // 2 = 5`
- `vprod[2] = den // vals[2] = 10 // 5 = 2`

Thus, the output would be `1 5 2`.

However, without the exact values, the most precise description is:

Output: **[space-separated values of vprod] (where each value is the result of den // r for r in vals)**
