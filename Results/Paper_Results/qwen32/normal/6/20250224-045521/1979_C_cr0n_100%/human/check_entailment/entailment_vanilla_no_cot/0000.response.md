To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly solves the problem as described. The goal is to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Let's analyze the provided program step by step:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
    - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
    - The formula used is `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, which is a standard way to compute the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `N`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of outcomes) and the multipliers `vals`.
    - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
    - It then calculates the product of the LCM divided by each multiplier, resulting in `vprod`.
    - The total bet is calculated as the sum of `vprod`.
    - It then checks if the LCM minus the total bet (`den - sum(vprod)`) is greater than 0.
    - If not, it outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution is possible.
    - Otherwise, it outputs the values in `vprod` as the bets.

### Analysis and Correctness Check

The key part of the logic is the calculation of `den` (LCM) and `vprod`. The program aims to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Here are some points to consider:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers is calculated correctly, ensuring that the product of the LCM divided by each multiplier (`vprod`) is an integer.
- **Total Bet Calculation**: The total bet is the sum of `vprod`, which is the LCM divided by each multiplier.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee that the bets are strictly less than the amount received for each outcome individually.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `3 3 2 7`
- **LCM Calculation**: LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42.
- **vprod Calculation**: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
- **Total Bet**: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
- **Check**: `42 - 41 = 1 > 0`, so the condition is satisfied.
- **Output**: `14 21 6`.

However, let's verify if this satisfies the problem's requirement:
- If the first outcome wins: `3 * 14 = 42` (which is not strictly greater than 41).
- If the second outcome wins: `2 * 21 = 42` (which is not strictly greater than 41).
- If the third outcome wins: `7 * 6 = 42` (which is not strictly greater than 41).

The output `14 21 6` does not satisfy the strict condition required by the problem.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because the condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome individually. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
