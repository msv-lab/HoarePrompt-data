The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The initial state mentions that `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes and `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. After the execution of the code, `vals` will be updated to contain these integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes; `vals` is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and each element in `vals` is an integer such that 2 <= vals[i] <= 20.**
