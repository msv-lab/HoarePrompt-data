To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an even integer.
   - `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `s` is constructed by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a certain number of times, specifically `n // 2` times.
   - Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer as well.
   - The length of `s` is given by the formula: \(\text{length of } s = 3 \times (n // 2)\).
   - Given that the length of `s` is less than 200, we can deduce that \(3 \times (n // 2) < 200\), which simplifies to \(n < \frac{400}{3} \approx 133.33\). Since `n` is an even integer, the maximum possible value for `n` is 132.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The string `s` will be a sequence of `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
   - Without a specific value for `n`, we cannot determine the exact string `s`, but we can describe it based on the given information.

Thus, the output will be a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times, where `n` is an even integer and the length of `s` is less than 200.

Output: **s (where s is the string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n // 2 times, and n is an even integer such that the length of s is less than 200)**
