The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 49. This implies `t` can range from 2 to 51.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `s` is a string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, this is what will be printed regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
