The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are defined in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is a string that consists of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times, with the length of `s` being 200 or more.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **NO**
