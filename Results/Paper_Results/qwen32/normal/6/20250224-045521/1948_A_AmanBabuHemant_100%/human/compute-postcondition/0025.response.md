The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The initial state describes variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 49\).
   - `n` is a new input integer.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement simply outputs the string 'NO' to the console.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output 'NO', the output will be 'NO' regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **NO**
