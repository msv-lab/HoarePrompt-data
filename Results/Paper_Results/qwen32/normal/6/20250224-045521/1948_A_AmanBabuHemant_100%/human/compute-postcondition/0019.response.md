Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 49\). This implies that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is defined as the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. This means that the string `s` will consist of the sequence `'AAB'` concatenated with itself `n // 2` times.
- The value of `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will be the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
- Since `n` is not specified, we can't determine the exact number of repetitions, but we can describe the value of `s` in terms of `n`.

### Output:
The string `s` is formed by repeating the string `'AAB'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`. Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of the sequence `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times**
