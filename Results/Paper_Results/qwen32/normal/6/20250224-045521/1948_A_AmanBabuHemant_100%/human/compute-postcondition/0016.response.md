The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 49\). This implies that `t` can take any integer value from 1 to 50.
2. The initial state also specifies that `n` is an input integer, but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `n`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on these variables.

Output: **NO**
