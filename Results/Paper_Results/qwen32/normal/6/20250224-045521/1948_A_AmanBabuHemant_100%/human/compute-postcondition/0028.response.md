Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 49\). This means \(t\) can range from 2 to 51 (inclusive).
2. `n` is a new input integer.
3. `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Here, `n // 2` means integer division of `n` by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is constructed as the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The exact value of `s` depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without more information. However, we can describe the value of `s` in terms of `n`.

### Calculation:
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer, and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will still be an integer (since it's integer division), and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

### Output:
The output will be the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

### Final Answer:
Output: **AAB repeated n // 2 times (where n is the input integer)**
