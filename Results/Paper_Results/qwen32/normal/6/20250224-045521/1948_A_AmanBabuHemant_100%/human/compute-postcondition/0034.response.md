Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd, in which case it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times and outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it outputs 'NO'.**
