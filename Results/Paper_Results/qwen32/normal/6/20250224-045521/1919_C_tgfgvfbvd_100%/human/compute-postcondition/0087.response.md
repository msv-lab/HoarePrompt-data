The code snippet provided swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given that initially `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `float('inf')`, after the swap, both `a` and `b` will still be `float('inf')`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0.**
