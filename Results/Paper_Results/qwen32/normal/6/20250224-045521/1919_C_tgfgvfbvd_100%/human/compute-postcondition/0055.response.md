Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; and `l[x]` is greater than `b`**

In simple terms: The value of `a` is now set to `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `a`.
