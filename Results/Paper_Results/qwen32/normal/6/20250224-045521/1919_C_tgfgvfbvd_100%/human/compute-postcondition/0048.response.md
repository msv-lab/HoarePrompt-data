Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0. If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition is true, but since there is no else part, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
