Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is now the previous value of `b`; `b` is now the previous value of `a`; `x` is `k + 1`.**

In simple terms, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. All other variables remain unchanged.
