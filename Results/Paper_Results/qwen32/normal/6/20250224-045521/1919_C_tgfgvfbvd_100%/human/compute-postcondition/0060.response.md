The code snippet provided swaps the values of `a` and `b`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the swap in terms of the variables themselves.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the previous value of `a`.**
