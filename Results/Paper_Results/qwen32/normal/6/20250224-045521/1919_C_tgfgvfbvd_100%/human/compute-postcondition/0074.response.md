Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is `l[x]`; `c` is `c + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `a` remain as they were before, except `x` has been used to update `a` to the next element in the list `l`.
