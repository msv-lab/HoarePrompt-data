Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The algorithm appears to be attempting to track two minimum values (a and b) and increment a penalty counter (c) when a new value in the list is greater than both a and b, but this approach does not guarantee that it finds the optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty.

The optimal strategy involves recognizing that the minimum penalty is achieved when the array can be split into two non-decreasing subsequences. A more effective approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence, and then the remainder would form the other subsequence. The penalty would be the sum of the lengths of these subsequences minus the length of the array (since each subsequence contributes one less penalty point than its length).

The provided code does not implement such a strategy and instead uses a flawed logic to count penalties, which will not yield the correct result in all cases.
