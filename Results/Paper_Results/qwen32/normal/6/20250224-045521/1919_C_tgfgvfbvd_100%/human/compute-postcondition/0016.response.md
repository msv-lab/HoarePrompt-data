The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is not greater than `b` and the element `l[x]` is greater than `b` is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 1; `a` is not greater than `b`; the element `l[x]` is greater than `b`**.
