To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables defined in the initial state:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. **n**: An integer obtained from the input. This integer likely represents the number of elements in the list `l`.
3. **l**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **a**: The smallest element in the list `l`.
5. **b**: The second smallest element in the list `l`.
6. **c**: The count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

The `print(c)` statement will output the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Since the exact elements of the list `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the value of `c` precisely.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both the smallest element `a` and the second smallest element `b`)**
