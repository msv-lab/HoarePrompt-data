Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was greater than `b`, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `b` is now `l[x]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `b` has been updated to the element at index `x` of the list `l`. The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
