The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `x`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; if `a` > `b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their previous values; `c` is set based on the previous iteration and is now incremented by 1; `x` is incremented by 1; `a` is `l[x]`.**
