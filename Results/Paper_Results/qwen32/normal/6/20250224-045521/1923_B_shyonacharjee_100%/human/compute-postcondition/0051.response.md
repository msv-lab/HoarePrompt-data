Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `pos` is `pos_next`; `health` is `health_next`; `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
