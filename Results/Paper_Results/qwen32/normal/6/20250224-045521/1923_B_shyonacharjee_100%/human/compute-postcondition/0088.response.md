Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `2 * health_next`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `3 * health_next`, `can_survive` is `False`, `pos` is `pos_next`, `health` is `health_next`**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `can_survive` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
