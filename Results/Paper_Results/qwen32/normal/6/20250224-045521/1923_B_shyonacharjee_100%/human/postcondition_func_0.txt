The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of integers representing monster health, and a list `x` of integers representing monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using bullets, where the number of bullets needed for each monster is equal to its health, and the total number of bullets used cannot exceed `k` times the distance to the monster. The function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated under these conditions, otherwise 'NO'.
