Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s and trailing `0`s removed, `n` is equal to `len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `res` is the number of `0`s in the original list `a` before removing leading and trailing `0`s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with all trailing zeros removed (or an empty list if `a` originally contained only zeros), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
