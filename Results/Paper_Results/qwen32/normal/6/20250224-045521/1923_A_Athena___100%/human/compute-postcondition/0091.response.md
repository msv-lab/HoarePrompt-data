To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to understand the given initial state and how the variable `res` is defined.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999.
- `a` is a non-empty list with all trailing zeros removed (or an empty list if `a` originally contained only zeros).
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.

### Analysis:
- Since `a` has all trailing zeros removed, the list `a` does not contain any zeros at the end.
- The variable `res` is defined as the total count of zeros in the list `a`. Given that all trailing zeros are removed, the only zeros that could be present in `a` are those that are not trailing zeros.

### Conclusion:
- If `a` originally contained only zeros, `a` would be an empty list after removing trailing zeros, and `res` would be 0.
- If `a` contained any non-trailing zeros, `res` would be the count of those non-trailing zeros.
- If `a` did not contain any zeros at all (trailing or non-trailing), `res` would be 0.

Therefore, the value of `res` is the count of non-trailing zeros in the original list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the count of non-trailing zeros in the original list `a`)**
