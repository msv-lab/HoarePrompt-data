The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state specifies that `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and a `0` appended to the end, the `pop()` operation will remove this trailing `0`.

Thus, after the `pop()` operation, the list `a` will no longer have the trailing `0` that was appended initially.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed (and the trailing 0 has been removed), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is 0.**
