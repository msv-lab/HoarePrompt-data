You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers (each either 0 or 1). For each test case, it counts and prints the number of zeros in the list after removing any leading and trailing zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to move chips in a ribbon so that they form a single contiguous block, minimizing the number of moves. Each move consists of shifting a chip to the closest free cell to its left. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of moves required for each test case.

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.

3. **Counting Gaps:**
   - The program then iterates through the trimmed list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) within the remaining segment.
   - Each zero encountered during this iteration represents a gap that needs to be filled by a chip moving from the right, thus incrementing the `res` counter.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of moves required to make all chips contiguous.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's approach is based on the observation that the number of moves required is equal to the number of gaps (free cells) between the chips after trimming the leading and trailing free cells. This is because each gap represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip moving from the right.

- **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:** This step ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains chips, which simplifies the problem.
- **Counting Gaps:** By counting the zeros in the trimmed segment, we correctly determine the number of moves required, as each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - Trimmed: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Gaps: `1` (one zero between the chips)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - Trimmed: `1`
   - Gaps: `0` (no gaps)
   - Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Trimmed: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Gaps: `0` (no gaps)
   - Output: `0` (correct)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Trimmed: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Gaps: `2` (two zeros between the chips)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - Trimmed: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Gaps: `3` (three zeros between the chips)
   - Output: `3` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of moves required to make all chips contiguous. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
