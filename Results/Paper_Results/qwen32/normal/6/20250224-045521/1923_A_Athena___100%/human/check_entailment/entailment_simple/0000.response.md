### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of forming a single block of chips with the minimum number of moves. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells (where `0` means free and `1` means a chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**: 
    - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a `while` loop that continues to pop the first element as long as it is `0`. This ensures that the first element of `a` is a `1`.
    - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros using another `while` loop that continues to pop the last element as long as it is `0`. This ensures that the last element of `a` is a `1`.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
    - After trimming, the program counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a`. Each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip to the left.
    - The variable `res` is incremented by `1` for each `0` found in the list `a`.

4. **Output**:
    - The program prints the value of `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Trimming Zeros**: By removing leading and trailing zeros, the program effectively focuses on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips. This is crucial because any leading or trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips.
  
- **Counting Gaps**: The number of zeros in the trimmed list `a` directly corresponds to the number of gaps between chips. Each gap needs to be filled by moving a chip to the left, which is exactly what the problem requires.

- **Edge Cases**: 
    - If there are no gaps (i.e., all chips are already contiguous), the program correctly outputs `0`.
    - If all cells contain chips (i.e., no zeros), the program also correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips. It handles all necessary edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
