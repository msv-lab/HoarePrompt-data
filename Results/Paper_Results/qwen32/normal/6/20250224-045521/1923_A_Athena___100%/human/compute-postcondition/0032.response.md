The given code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. This means that the previous value of `n` (which was `len(a)`) will be lost and replaced by the new input value. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s and trailing `0`s removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is the number of `0`s in the original list `a` before removing leading and trailing `0`s.**
