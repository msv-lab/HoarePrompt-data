The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a[-1]` is `0`, this `0` will be removed. Therefore, `n`, which is the number of elements left in `a` after removing leading `0`s, will decrease by 1. The value of `t` and `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the number of elements left in `a` after all leading `0`s are removed and `a` must contain at least one element which is `0`, decreased by 1; `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s removed and the last element `0` is removed; `res` is 0.**
