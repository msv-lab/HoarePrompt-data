Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold the total number of zeros found in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
