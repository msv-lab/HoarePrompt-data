Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; if `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, and `ps` is 1; otherwise, `win` retains its original value, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0; the current value of `i` is in `us`.**
