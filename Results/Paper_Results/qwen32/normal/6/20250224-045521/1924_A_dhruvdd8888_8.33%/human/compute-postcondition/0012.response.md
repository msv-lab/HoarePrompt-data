The given code snippet clears the `win` set. This means that after the execution of `win.clear()`, the `win` set will be empty. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`; `ps` is 1; the current value of `i` is in `us`.**
