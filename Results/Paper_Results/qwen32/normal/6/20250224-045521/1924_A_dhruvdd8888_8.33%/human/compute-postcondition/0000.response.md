The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `s`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
