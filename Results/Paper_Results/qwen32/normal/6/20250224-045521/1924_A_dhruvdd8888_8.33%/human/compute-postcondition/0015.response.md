The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. 

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an element of the set `us` and has just been used in the loop body. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, `i` should be updated to the next character in the string for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`; If `len(win) == k`, then `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, and `ps` is set to 1; otherwise, `win` retains its original value, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0.**

To be more precise, if `i` was the `j`-th character in `s`, then in the next iteration, `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character in `s`. If `i` was the last character in `s`, the loop would terminate, so we assume `i` is not the last character in `s` for the next iteration to occur.
