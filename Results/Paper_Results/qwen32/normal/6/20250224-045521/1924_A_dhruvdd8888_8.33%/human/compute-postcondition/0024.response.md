The code snippet `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. None of the other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `i`, and `win` remain the same. The only change is that the list `ans` now includes the character `i` at the end of it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `s[j+1]` where `j` is the current index of `i` in `s`); `win` is a set that now includes the character `i`; `ans` is a list that now includes the character `i`**.
