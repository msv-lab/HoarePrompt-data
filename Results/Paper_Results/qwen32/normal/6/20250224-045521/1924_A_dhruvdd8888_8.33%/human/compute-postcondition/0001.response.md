The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This overwrites the previous value of `s` with the new input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input.**
