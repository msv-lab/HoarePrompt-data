Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - The game is played on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns, placing white and black rooks respectively.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (share the same row or column).
   - If a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the opponent must place a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - The game continues until no valid moves are left.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Input**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - The `k` moves played by the first player.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then reads the `k` moves and adjusts `n` based on the moves:
  - If `a != b`, it subtracts 2 from `n` (indicating that both rows and columns `a` and `b` are no longer available).
  - If `a == b`, it subtracts 1 from `n` (indicating that the diagonal `a == b` is no longer available).
- It calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
- `func_1(n)` calculates the number of configurations using dynamic programming:
  - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]`, which seems to account for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

### Correctness of the Program:
1. **Adjusting `n`**:
   - The program correctly adjusts `n` based on the moves played. If a move is made at `(r, c)` with `r != c`, both rows and columns are blocked, reducing `n` by 2. If `r == c`, only one position is blocked, reducing `n` by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]` is intended to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `n` positions.
   - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, which are correct (0 positions have 1 way to place no rooks, and 1 position has 1 way to place a single rook).
   - The recurrence relation is correct for calculating the number of configurations, assuming the relation accurately models the problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is necessary due to the large possible values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
