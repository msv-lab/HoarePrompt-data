The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Since the loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Here are the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be 4.
- `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [5, 9], `i` is 4**
