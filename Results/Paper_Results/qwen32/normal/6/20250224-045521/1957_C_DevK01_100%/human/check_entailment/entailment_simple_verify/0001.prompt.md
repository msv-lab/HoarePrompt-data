You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - The game is played on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns, placing white and black rooks respectively.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (share the same row or column).
   - If a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the opponent must place a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - The game continues until no valid moves are left.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Input**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - The `k` moves played by the first player.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then reads the `k` moves and adjusts `n` based on the moves:
  - If `a != b`, it subtracts 2 from `n` (indicating that both rows and columns `a` and `b` are no longer available).
  - If `a == b`, it subtracts 1 from `n` (indicating that the diagonal `a == b` is no longer available).
- It calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
- `func_1(n)` calculates the number of configurations using dynamic programming:
  - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]`, which seems to account for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

### Correctness of the Program:
1. **Adjusting `n`**:
   - The program correctly adjusts `n` based on the moves played. If a move is made at `(r, c)` with `r != c`, both rows and columns are blocked, reducing `n` by 2. If `r == c`, only one position is blocked, reducing `n` by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]` is intended to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `n` positions.
   - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, which are correct (0 positions have 1 way to place no rooks, and 1 position has 1 way to place a single rook).
   - The recurrence relation is correct for calculating the number of configurations, assuming the relation accurately models the problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is necessary due to the large possible values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
