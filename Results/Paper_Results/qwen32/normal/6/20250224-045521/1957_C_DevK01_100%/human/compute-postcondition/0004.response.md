The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the previous iteration would have been with `i` being 2 and the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration), and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [1, (1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % 17], `i` is 3**
