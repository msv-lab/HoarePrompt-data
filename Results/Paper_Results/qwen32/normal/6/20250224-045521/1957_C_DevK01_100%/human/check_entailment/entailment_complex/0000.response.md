Reasoning:

The provided Python code is intended to solve a problem related to placing rooks on a chessboard without them attacking each other. The code reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a board size `n` and `k` moves already made. For each move, it adjusts the number of available positions for placing rooks by subtracting 1 or 2, depending on whether the move was on the diagonal or not. The final result for each test case is supposed to be the number of possible configurations of the board after all valid moves are made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, the function `func_1(n)` does not compute the number of possible configurations based on `n`. Instead, it always returns the same value, `888285363`, regardless of the input `n`. This is evident from the state of the `dp` list after the loop, which is not dependent on the input `n` in the way that would be necessary to solve the problem correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1(n)` should use a dynamic programming approach or another suitable method to calculate the number of configurations based on the remaining size of the board `n`. The current implementation does not do this, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
