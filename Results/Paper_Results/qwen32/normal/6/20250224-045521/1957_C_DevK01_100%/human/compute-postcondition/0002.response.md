The given code snippet modifies the list `dp` by appending a new value to it. The new value is calculated using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Here, `dp[-1]` and `dp[-2]` refer to the last and second last elements of the list `dp` respectively, and `i` is not defined in the snippet, so it is assumed to be a variable that should be defined in the context where this code is used. However, since `i` is not provided, we will keep it as `i` in the output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [1, 1, (1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]**.

In natural language: The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves `r_i` and `c_i` remain unchanged. The list `dp` originally had the values `[1, 1]` and now has an additional value calculated as `(1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, making the new `dp` list `[1, 1, (1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]`.
