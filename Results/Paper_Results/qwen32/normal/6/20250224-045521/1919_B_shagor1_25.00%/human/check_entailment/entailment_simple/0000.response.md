### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` as described in the problem. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty based on the rules provided.

The logic in `func_1` simply calculates `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg` else `n`, where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the count of '-' characters. This formula does not account for the optimal splitting of the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array `a` such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not follow any such strategy and thus will not produce the correct results for all test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
