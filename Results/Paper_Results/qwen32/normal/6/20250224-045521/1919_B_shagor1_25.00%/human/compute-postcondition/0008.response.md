The code snippet `neg += 1` increments the value of the variable `neg` by 1. Given the initial state, `neg` is either 0 or 1. After the increment, `neg` will be either 1 or 2.

The other variables (`s`, `i`, `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in `s`, `neg` is either 1 or 2**.
