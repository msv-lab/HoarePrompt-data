The code snippet provided initializes a variable `neg` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `n` or `s` as they are part of the input and are not modified by the given code snippet. The variable `neg` is set to 0 for each test case, but no further operations are performed on it in the provided code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The next line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `neg` is 0.**
