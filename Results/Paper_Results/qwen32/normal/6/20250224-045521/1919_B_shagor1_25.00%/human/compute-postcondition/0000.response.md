The code provided reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of a string `s` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The length `n` of the string `s` is between 1 and 5000, inclusive. After executing the code snippet `n = int(input())`, the variable `n` will hold the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The next line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `n` is an input integer.**
