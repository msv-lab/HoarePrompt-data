Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value derived from the string `s`, specifically `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`), otherwise it prints `n`.**
