Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the height `b` of the rectangle is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut.

To solve this problem, Bob can cut the rectangle in two ways:
1. Cut parallel to the side of length `a`, resulting in two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`.
2. Cut parallel to the side of length `b`, resulting in two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`.

For Bob to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, the resulting rectangles must be able to be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is possible if either `a` or `b` is even, because then the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

The correct condition should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to form another rectangle.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This code checks if either `a` or `b` is even, and if so, returns "yes", otherwise it returns "no".
