### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. The key insight is that the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions of the original rectangle (either `a` or `b`) can be evenly divided into two parts.

The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and ignores the value of `a`. This is incorrect because the condition for forming another rectangle depends on whether either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`. Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is even, then the rectangle can be cut into two equal parts along that dimension, and the two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of `a` being even. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

**Correctness: False**
