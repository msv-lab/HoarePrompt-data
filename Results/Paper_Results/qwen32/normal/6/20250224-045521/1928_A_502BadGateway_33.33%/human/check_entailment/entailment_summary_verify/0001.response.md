Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer sides, and then those two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations as the same).

### Key Insight

The key insight is that a new rectangle can be formed if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle can be evenly divided, allowing the formation of two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This means:
- If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\). These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times a\).
- If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program only checks if \(b\) is even and ignores \(a\):
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Function Summary

The function summary confirms that the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. This means the function ignores the dimension `a`.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program is correct because it only checks if \(b\) is even, which is sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. However, this reasoning is incomplete because the program should also consider the case where \(a\) is even.

### Challenging the Original Assessment

The original assessment is inaccurate because it does not account for the possibility that \(a\) could be even, which would also allow the formation of a new rectangle. The program should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the original program only checks if \(b\) is even, it fails to consider cases where \(a\) is even. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
