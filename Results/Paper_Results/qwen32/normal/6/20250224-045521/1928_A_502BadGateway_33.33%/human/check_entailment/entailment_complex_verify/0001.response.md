Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these to form a new rectangle. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides.
2. The resulting rectangles must be able to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original, considering rotations as the same.

### Key Insight:
For Bob to form a new rectangle:
- If \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\) rectangle (or vice versa).
- If \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a \(b \times \frac{a}{2}\) rectangle (or vice versa).

Thus, the correct condition should be that either \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code only checks if \(b\) is even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```
This means the code will return "yes" only if \(b\) is even, and "no" otherwise. However, this is incorrect because the condition should be that either \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

### Annotations:
The annotations state:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` within the range of 1 to 10^9. It returns 'yes' if `b` is even, and 'no' if `b` is odd. The value of `a` is not used in the function's execution.
```
The annotations correctly describe what the function does, but they do not account for the problem's requirement that either \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because the code does not check if \(a\) is even. The correct logic should be to return "yes" if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks if \(b\) is even, whereas the correct condition is that either \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.
