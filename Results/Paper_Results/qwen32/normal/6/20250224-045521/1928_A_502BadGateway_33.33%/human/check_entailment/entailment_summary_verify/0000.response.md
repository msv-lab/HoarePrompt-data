### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given solution systematically using the provided function summary and problem description.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`.
   - He can cut it into two rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He needs to determine if he can form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - Rotations of rectangles are considered the same (e.g., `6x4` and `4x6` are the same).

2. **Cutting and Rearranging**:
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle horizontally, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)` each if `a` is even.
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle vertically, he gets two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)` each if `b` is even.
   - For each of these cases, Bob needs to check if these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

3. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - **Horizontal Cut**: If `a` is even, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)`. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even.
   - **Vertical Cut**: If `b` is even, he gets two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)`. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise 'no'.
   - The function does not consider the case where `a` is even.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The given function only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient.
   - It should also check if `a` is even.
   - The correct condition should be: return 'yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, otherwise 'no'.

6. **Counterexamples**:
   - For `4x3`, the function returns 'no' because `b` is odd. However, cutting horizontally into `2x3` rectangles and rearranging them into `3x4` is possible.
   - For `3x2`, the function returns 'no' because `b` is odd. However, cutting vertically into `3x1` rectangles and rearranging them into `1x6` is possible.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the case where `a` is even. Therefore, the program fails to handle all valid cases where another rectangle can be formed.

**Final: False**
