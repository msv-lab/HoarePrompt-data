### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. After cutting, he can rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form another rectangle. The key point here is that the two smaller rectangles must be able to form a new rectangle with integer dimensions, and the new rectangle must be different from the original.

#### Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle:
1. **Horizontal Cut**: If Bob cuts the rectangle horizontally, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be \((\frac{a}{2}, b)\) and \((\frac{a}{2}, b)\) if \(a\) is even. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size \((a, \frac{b}{2})\) if \(b\) is even.
2. **Vertical Cut**: If Bob cuts the rectangle vertically, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be \((a, \frac{b}{2})\) and \((a, \frac{b}{2})\) if \(b\) is even. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size \((\frac{a}{2}, b)\) if \(a\) is even.

From the above, we can see that the program should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.

#### Provided Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

#### Annotated Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right before the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise 'no'
```

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The program only checks if \(b\) is even, which is not sufficient. It should also check if \(a\) is even to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

#### Counterexample:
- **Input**: `4 3`
- **Expected Output**: `Yes` (because cutting horizontally results in two `2x3` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `3x4` rectangle)
- **Actual Output**: `No` (because the program only checks if \(b\) is even, and \(3\) is not even)

#### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of cutting horizontally.

**Final: False**
