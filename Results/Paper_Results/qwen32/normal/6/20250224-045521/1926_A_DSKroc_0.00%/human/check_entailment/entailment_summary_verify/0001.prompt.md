You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the last string has more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the placement of the `if-else` statement that determines the most frequent character. The `if-else` block is currently outside the loop that iterates through each test case, which means it will only compare the counts of 'A' and 'B' from the last test case. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Loop through test cases**: The outer loop correctly iterates through `t` test cases.
2. **Count occurrences of 'A' and 'B'**: For each string `s` in each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Determine the most frequent character**: The `if-else` block that compares `ac` and `bc` to determine the most frequent character should be inside the loop for each test case. Currently, it is outside, so it only checks the counts from the last test case.

The corrected program should look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        # Compare counts for each test case
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
