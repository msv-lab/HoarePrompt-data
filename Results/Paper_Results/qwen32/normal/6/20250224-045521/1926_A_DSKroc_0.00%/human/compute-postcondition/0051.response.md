Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ac` is 1 if `s[q]` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1 if `s[q]` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is \(q + 1\), `bc` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `bc` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
