The only variable in the loop head is `s`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each line in the input file starting from the second line (i.e., `[1:]` skips the first line). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be the next line in the input file.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the split string `s` (from the previous iteration), `k` is the second integer from the split string `s` (from the previous iteration), `s` is the next line in the input file**.
