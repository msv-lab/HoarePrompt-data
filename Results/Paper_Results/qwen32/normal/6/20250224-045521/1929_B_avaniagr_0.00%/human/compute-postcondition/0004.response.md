The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by splitting the string `s` and converting the resulting substrings to integers. Therefore, `n` will now hold the integer value of the first substring from `s`, and `k` will hold the integer value of the second substring from `s`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it holds the next line from the input file.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first substring from `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second substring from `s`, `s` is the next line in the input file.**
