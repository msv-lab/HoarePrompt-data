You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
- There are `4n - 2` diagonals in an `n x n` grid.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the logic of the code:
- The code iterates over multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then computes the minimum number of cells to color using the formula:
  ```python
  (k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
  ```

### Verification:
We need to verify if this formula correctly computes the minimum number of cells to color for any given `n` and `k`.

#### Case 1: `k < 4n - 3`
- If `k < 4n - 3`, the formula simplifies to:
  ```python
  (k // 2 + k % 2)
  ```
  This is essentially `ceil(k / 2)`, which seems to be correct because coloring `ceil(k / 2)` cells can cover `k` diagonals in the best case.

#### Case 2: `k >= 4n - 3`
- If `k >= 4n - 3`, the formula simplifies to:
  ```python
  2 * n + (k == 4 * n - 2)
  ```
  This seems to be incorrect. For `k >= 4n - 3`, we need to cover almost all diagonals. The correct approach would be to color one cell in each of the `4n - 2` diagonals, which means we need to color `n` cells on the main diagonal and `n-1` cells on the secondary diagonal, totaling `2n - 1` cells. However, the formula suggests `2n` cells, which is incorrect.

#### Case 3: `k == 4n - 2`
- If `k == 4n - 2`, the formula adds `1` to `2n`, which results in `2n + 1`. This is also incorrect for the same reason as above.

### Conclusion:
The formula used in the program does not correctly handle the cases where `k >= 4n - 3`. Specifically, it overestimates the number of cells needed for these cases.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the case `n = 2` and `k = 6`:
- There are `4 * 2 - 2 = 6` diagonals.
- The program computes:
  ```python
  (6 // 2 + 6 % 2) * (6 < 4 * 2 - 3) + 2 * 2 * (6 >= 4 * 2 - 3) + (6 == 4 * 2 - 2)
  ```
  Simplifying this:
  ```python
  0 + 4 + 0 = 4
  ```
  However, the correct answer is `2` because we can color one cell in each of the 6 diagonals by coloring the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells to color for cases where `k >= 4n - 3`.
