Given the initial state where `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, but the current value of `bit` is -1, the code snippet provided is `return len(cur_arr)`. 

Since the value of `bit` is not used in the provided code snippet, we only need to consider `cur_arr` for the output. The function returns the length of `cur_arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`**, where `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
