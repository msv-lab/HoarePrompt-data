Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is either `i` or 0, `thing1` is 0, and if the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing `i`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.**
