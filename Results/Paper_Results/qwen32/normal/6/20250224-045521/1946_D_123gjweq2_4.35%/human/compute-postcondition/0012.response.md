The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the current element being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must have at least one more element. The variable `i` will be updated to the next element in `cur_arr`.

The other variables (`bit`, `xor`, `thing1`, and `new_arr`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is either `i` or 0, `thing1` is 0, and if the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing `i`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
