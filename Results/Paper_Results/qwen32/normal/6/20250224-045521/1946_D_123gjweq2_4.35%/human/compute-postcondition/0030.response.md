Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

Here, `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` will return a value based on the function's logic, which is not specified, but it is compared with the length of `new_arr`. Since `xor >> bit & 1` is true and `(x >> bit & 1)` is true, it means that the condition for `new_arr` was met at some point, and `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` up to the point where the if condition was met or after each iteration if the else part is executed. The length of `new_arr` is a specific number, and the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is another specific value. The program returns the greater of these two values.
