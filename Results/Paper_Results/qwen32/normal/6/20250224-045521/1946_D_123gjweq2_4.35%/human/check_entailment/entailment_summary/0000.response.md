Reasoning:

The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in the array such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number `x`. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic.

Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to split the array into the maximum number of segments.
   - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment must be less than or equal to `x`.
   - The segments must be contiguous and cover the entire array from start to end.

2. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The main function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the array and a fixed value of `31`.
   - The `find_max` function is supposed to recursively determine the maximum number of segments based on the bit position.
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic for checking the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of segments against `x`.

The main issues are:
- The function `find_max` does not take into account the value of `x` when determining the segments.
- The logic for partitioning the array and checking the conditions is incorrect.
- The function does not ensure that the segments are contiguous and cover the entire array.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
