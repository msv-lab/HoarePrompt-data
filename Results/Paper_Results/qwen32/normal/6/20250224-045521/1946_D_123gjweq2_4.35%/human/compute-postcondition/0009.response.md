The code snippet appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. The value of `xor` is `i` as per the initial state. No other variables are affected by this operation. The condition regarding the bit in the binary representation of `xor` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing `i`, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0, and the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0.**
