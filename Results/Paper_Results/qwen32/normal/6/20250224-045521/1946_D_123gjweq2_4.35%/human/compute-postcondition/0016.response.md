Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the previous elements (if any) and the new element `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
