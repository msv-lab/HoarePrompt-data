The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last processed element of `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in `cur_arr`.

Given that `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, and `i` was the last processed element, `i` should now be the next element in the list for the next iteration.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.** 

To be more specific, if `i` was the first element in the previous iteration, it should now be the second element in `cur_arr` for the next iteration.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.** 

Since `i` was the last processed element, let's denote the current `i` as the k-th element. For the next iteration, `i` should be the (k+1)-th element in `cur_arr`.

To clarify, if `i` was the first element (index 0) in the previous iteration, `i` should now be the second element (index 1) in `cur_arr` for the next iteration.

Since `i` was the last processed element, let's assume `i` was at index `k` in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be at index `k+1`.
