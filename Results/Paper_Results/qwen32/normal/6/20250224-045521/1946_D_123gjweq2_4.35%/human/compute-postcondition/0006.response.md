To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `cur_arr`, so the state of `cur_arr` is critical. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, `thing1`, and `i`) are not directly part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop is defined as `for i in cur_arr:`. This means the loop will execute if `cur_arr` is not empty because `i` will take on each value in `cur_arr` sequentially.

2. **Adjustments**: 
   - `cur_arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The current state says `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, which is good, but we need to ensure it's not empty.
   - The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, `thing1`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head. Their states are already provided and can remain as they are.

Based on the above analysis, the state should be adjusted to ensure `cur_arr` has at least one element.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
