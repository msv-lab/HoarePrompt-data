Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not (x >> bit & 1)` up to the point where the else condition was met or after each iteration if the else part is executed, `xor` is 0 if the last element caused a reset or the result of the last XOR operation where `(x >> bit & 1)` is false, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` since the if condition was not met.**
