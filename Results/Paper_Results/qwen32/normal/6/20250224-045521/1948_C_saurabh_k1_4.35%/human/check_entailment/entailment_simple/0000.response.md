Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the rules and constraints described in the problem statement. The program checks only the second last character of the second row (b[n - 2]) and prints "No" if it is '<', otherwise it prints "Yes". This simplistic check does not take into account the full path the robot must follow, including the interaction between the two rows and the sequence of moves the robot can make.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movement step by step, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow in each cell. It should account for the possibility of the robot moving between rows and the direction of the arrows in both rows to determine if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, it is clear that it does not always produce the correct output for all possible valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
