The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of those directly influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
   - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('Yes')` statement outputs the string `'Yes'` directly.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`), the conditions, or any other computed values, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Output: **Yes**
