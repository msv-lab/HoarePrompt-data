Output State: **t is 0, n is the last input integer, a is the list of characters from the last input string for the first row, b is the list of characters from the last input string for the second row. The program has printed 'No' if b[n - 2] was '<' for any of the test cases, otherwise it has printed 'Yes'.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it was decremented in each iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case that was processed. The program will have printed 'No' if the second last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) was '<' for any of the test cases, otherwise it will have printed 'Yes'.
