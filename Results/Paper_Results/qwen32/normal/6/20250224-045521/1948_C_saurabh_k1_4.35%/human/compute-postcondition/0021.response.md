Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` has been decremented by 1, but since `t` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we don't know its exact value before this operation.
- `n` is the new input integer: This means `n` holds the value of a newly provided integer input.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input: This means `a` is a list where each element is a single character from the input string.
- `b` is a list where each element is a character from the new input string: This means `b` is also a list where each element is a single character from the input string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
