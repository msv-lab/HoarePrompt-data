Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans` (specifically, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1), `cnt` is recalculated as `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` if `i > 0`, otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` contains all elements of `a` and, if `i > 0`, additional integers between each pair of consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, plus `a[i]`, `i` is `len(a)`, and `adv` is 0.**

In simpler terms: The value of `counter[a[i]]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
