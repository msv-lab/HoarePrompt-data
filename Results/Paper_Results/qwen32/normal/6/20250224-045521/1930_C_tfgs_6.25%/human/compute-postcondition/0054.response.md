Postcondition: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`, `cnt` is recalculated as `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` if `i > 0`, otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` contains all elements of `a` and, if `i > 0`, additional integers between each pair of consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `i` is `len(a)`, and `adv` is 0.**
