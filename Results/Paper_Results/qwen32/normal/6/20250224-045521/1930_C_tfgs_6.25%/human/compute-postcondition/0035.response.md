The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the state of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be the current value of `j` plus 1, provided that this new value is still less than `adv`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 3 Â· 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with consecutive elements having a difference of at least 2, `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` > 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` > 0 if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)` > 0, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended to it, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])` > 0, `j` is `j + 1`**
