Postcondition: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans)` if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `adv` is 0.**
