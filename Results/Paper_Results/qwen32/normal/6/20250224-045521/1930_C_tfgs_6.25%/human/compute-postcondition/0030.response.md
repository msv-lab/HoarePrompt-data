Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans` and, if `i > 0`, the count of `a[i - 1]` is decremented by `adv`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with `a[i]` appended to it, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`.**

In this output state, the variable `adv` is calculated as the minimum of the difference between the previous element in the list `a` and the current element minus 1, the remaining count `cnt`, and the count of the previous element in the `counter` object. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
