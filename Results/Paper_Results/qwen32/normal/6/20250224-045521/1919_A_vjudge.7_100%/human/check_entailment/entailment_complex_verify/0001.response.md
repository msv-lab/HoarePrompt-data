### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly analyzes the game and the logic behind determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, `a + b`. The key insight is that if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be able to mirror Alice's moves and win the game. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, it means the sum is even, and the program prints "Bob". If the result is `1`, it means the sum is odd, and the program prints "Alice".

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the correct winner based on the parity of `a + b`. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, further validating the accuracy of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
