To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and see if the program correctly implements that logic.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:** Alice and Bob each have a certain number of coins, `a` and `b` respectively.
2. **Turns and Moves:** Players take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move (i.e., whose wallet is empty and the opponent's wallet is also empty) loses.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

- **If `a + b` is even:** Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves, ensuring that the game ends with Bob making the last move. This is because each time Alice makes a move, Bob can make a corresponding move, and vice versa. Since the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, and Alice will lose.
- **If `a + b` is odd:** Alice can make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, forcing Bob into the losing position where he will eventually be unable to make a move.

### Program Logic:
The given program checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`:
- If `a + b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If `a + b` is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Verification:
Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1:** `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even), so Bob wins.
2. **Example 2:** `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd), so Alice wins.
3. **Example 3:** `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even), so Bob wins.
4. **Example 4:** `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `a + b = 9` (odd), so Alice wins.
5. **Example 5:** `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - `a + b = 20` (even), so Bob wins.
6. **Example 6:** `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - `a + b = 174` (even), so Bob wins.
7. **Example 7:** `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - `a + b = 10339` (odd), so Alice wins.
8. **Example 8:** `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - `a + b = 846485` (odd), so Alice wins.
9. **Example 9:** `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even), so Bob wins.
10. **Example 10:** `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - `a + b = 55134` (even), so Bob wins.

All these examples match the expected output, confirming that the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
