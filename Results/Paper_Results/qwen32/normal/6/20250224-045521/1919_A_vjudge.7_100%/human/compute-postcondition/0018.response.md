Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals `test`, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. The loop has completed all `test` iterations, printing 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, or 'Alice' if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will have reached the value of `test`, and the loop will have printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` for each input pair provided. The values of `a` and `b` will reflect the last pair of integers read from the input.
