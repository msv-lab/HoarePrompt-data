The provided code snippet contains a simple print statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. This string is not dependent on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The conditions specified (such as the range of `t`, `a`, and `b`, and the fact that the sum of `a` and `b` is even) do not influence the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
