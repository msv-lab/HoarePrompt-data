Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. Specifically, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then `a + b & 1 == 0` evaluates to true. Otherwise, if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, then `a + b & 1 == 0` evaluates to false. The condition checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, but does not alter the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `test`.**
