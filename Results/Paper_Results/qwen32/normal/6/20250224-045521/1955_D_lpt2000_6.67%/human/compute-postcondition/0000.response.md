The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. The initial state includes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) which are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the input value to `nabors`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; b is a list of m integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer.**
