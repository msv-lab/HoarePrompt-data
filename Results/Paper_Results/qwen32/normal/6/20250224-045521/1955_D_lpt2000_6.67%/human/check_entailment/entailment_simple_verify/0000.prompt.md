You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code seems correct:

1. **Initialization and Counters**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of elements in the initial subsegment of `a` (of length `m`) and in `b`.
   - `cnt_aa` keeps track of the counts of elements in the current subsegment of `a`.
   - `cnt_bb` keeps track of the counts of elements in `b`.
   - The intersection of these two counters (`D`) gives the common elements and their minimum counts between `a` and `b` in the initial subsegment.
   - `E` and `C` are used to keep track of the elements that are in `cnt_aa` but not in `D` and vice versa, respectively.

2. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The initial count of matching elements (`tot`) is calculated from the intersection `D`.
   - If `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, the current subsegment is considered good, and `fnd` is incremented.
   - The program then slides the window one element to the right, updating `cnt_aa` by removing the count of the outgoing element and adding the count of the incoming element.
   - The counters `D`, `E`, and `C` are updated accordingly to reflect these changes.
   - The program checks if the new count of matching elements (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `k` and updates `fnd` accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles subsegments of length `m` at the boundaries of `a` correctly.
   - The use of `Counter` ensures that the program efficiently counts and updates the occurrences of elements in the subsegments.
   - The logic for updating the counters and checking the number of matching elements is consistent with the problem description.

### Testing with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

```
5
7 4 2
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
7 4 4
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
11 5 3
9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3
6 9 7 8 10
4 1 1
4 1 5 6
6
```

The program's output:
```
4
3
2
4
1
```

These outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program correctly handles the given examples.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and testing, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles various edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
