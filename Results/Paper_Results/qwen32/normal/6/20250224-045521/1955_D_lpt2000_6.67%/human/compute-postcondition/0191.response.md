Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The integer `n` represents the length of list `a`, `m` represents the length of list `b`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n. Each element in list `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a value based on the given constraints.**
