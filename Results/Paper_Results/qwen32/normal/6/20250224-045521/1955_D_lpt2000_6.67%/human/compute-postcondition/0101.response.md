Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference of the last `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `bb`, with `E[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference of the elements in `bb` that are not in the last `m` elements of `aa`, updated to reflect `cnt_bb - D`, with `C[out_aa]` incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`; `fnd` is 2 if `tot` >= `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1; `D[out_aa]` is 0 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] == 0`; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not equal to `D[in_aa]`. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
