Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. The logic for updating `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` remains the same as described in the initial state.
