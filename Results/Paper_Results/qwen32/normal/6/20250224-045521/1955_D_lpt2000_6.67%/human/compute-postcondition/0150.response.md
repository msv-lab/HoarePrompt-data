Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `bb` is a new list of integers; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`. The values of `E[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `tot`, and `fnd` remain unchanged unless specified by subsequent operations within the if block.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and includes the additional information that `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]` after entering the if condition.
