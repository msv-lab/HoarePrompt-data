The code snippet `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value stored in the dictionary `E` at the key `out_aa` by 1. This affects the value of `E[out_aa]` directly. The other variables (`in_aa`, `out_aa`, `aa`, `m`, `n`) are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1**.
