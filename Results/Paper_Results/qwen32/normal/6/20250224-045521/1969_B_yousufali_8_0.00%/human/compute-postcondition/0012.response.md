Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element. If the current element `s[i]` is 1, then `n` is set to 1 or 2, and `ans` remains 0 or is set to 2 if a previous `s[i]` was 1. If the current element `s[i]` is 0, then `n` remains 0 or is set to 2, and `ans` is set to 2 if `n` was not 0. `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases.**
