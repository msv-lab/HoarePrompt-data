The function reads a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) from the input, calculates the accumulated cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0, and prints the result. The cost is computed as the sum of (number of 1s encountered + 1) for each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been encountered.
