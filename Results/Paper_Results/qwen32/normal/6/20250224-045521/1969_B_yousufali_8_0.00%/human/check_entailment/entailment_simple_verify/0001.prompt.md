You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring and minimizing the total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function is supposed to process a single binary string and calculate the minimum cost.
2. `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

#### `func_1` Analysis
1. The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
2. It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
3. It iterates through the string:
   - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

#### `func_2` Analysis
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

**Key Insight:**
- To sort a binary string, all '1's need to be moved to the right of all '0's.
- The cost to move a '1' past a '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (the cost of the cyclic shift).

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement: `101011`.

- Initially, `n = 0` and `ans = 0`.
- First character is '1': `n = 1`.
- Second character is '0': `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (move the '1' past the '0').
- Third character is '1': `n = 2`.
- Fourth character is '0': `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5` (move the two '1's past the '0').
- Fifth character is '1': `n = 3`.
- Sixth character is '1': `n = 4`.

The total cost is `5`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string based on the problem's requirements.
