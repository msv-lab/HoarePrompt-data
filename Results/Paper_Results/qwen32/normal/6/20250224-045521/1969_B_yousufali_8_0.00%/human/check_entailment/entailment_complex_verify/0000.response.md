### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the annotated code to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is the length of the substring.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input using `input().split()`, which expects a space-separated list of integers. However, the problem description specifies that the input is a binary string without spaces.
   - This discrepancy suggests that the input handling is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It counts the number of `1`s before each `0` and adds `n + 1` to the cost for each such occurrence. This approach does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves more complex algorithms, such as dynamic programming, to determine the minimum cost of transforming the string into a sorted form.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the operations being performed. However, they do not address the fundamental issues with input handling and the flawed logic for cost calculation.
   - The annotations confirm that the program is reading the input as a list of integers and calculating the cost based on the number of `1`s before each `0`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with input handling and the flawed logic for cost calculation.
- It points out that the program does not correctly handle the input and does not implement the correct algorithm to determine the minimum cost.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the input and does not implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
