Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is equal to the length of the substring.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

- `func_1` is supposed to read a binary string, compute the minimum cost to sort it, and print the result. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It reads a list of binary integers from the input, but the input is a binary string, not a list of integers separated by spaces. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not align with the problem's requirement. It calculates a cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0, which does not correspond to the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.

- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. The function `func_2` itself is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases, but it relies on the correct implementation of `func_1`.

Since `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
