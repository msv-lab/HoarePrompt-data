You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0. The variable n counts the number of 1s encountered in the list s up to the current index, and ans accumulates the cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, n is the total count of 1s in s, and ans is the sum of (n + 1) for each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been encountered.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (n + 1) for each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been encountered in the list `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) from the input, calculates the accumulated cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0, and prints the result. The cost is computed as the sum of (number of 1s encountered + 1) for each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been encountered.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `func_1()` has been called `t` times, and `t` remains the same as the initial input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input and calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function's sole action is to invoke `func_1` multiple times based on the user's input.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input in a way that expects a space-separated list of integers, which does not match the problem description. The problem description specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a single binary string, but it reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the required algorithm to calculate the minimum cost. The current implementation seems to count the cost based on the number of `1`s before each `0`, which is not the correct approach for determining the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves finding the minimum cost to transform the string into a sorted form using cyclic shifts, which is a more complex problem involving dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the first test case: `s = "10"`. The program will read this as a list of integers `[1, 0]` and calculate the cost as `2`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is `2` as explained in the problem statement, but the program's logic is flawed and may not generalize to other cases correctly.
   - For `s = "11000"`, the program will calculate the cost as `9`, which is correct in this specific case but does not guarantee correctness for all cases due to the flawed logic.

To correct the program, the input handling should be adjusted to read binary strings correctly, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost should be implemented properly, possibly using dynamic programming or another suitable algorithm.

Since the program does not correctly handle the input and does not implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost, it is considered incorrect.
