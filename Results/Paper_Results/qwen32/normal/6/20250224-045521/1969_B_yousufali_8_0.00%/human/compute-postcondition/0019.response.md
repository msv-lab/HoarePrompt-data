Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least `i + 1` elements. `i` is unchanged. If `s[i] == 0` and `n != 0`, then `ans` is increased by `n + 1`. Otherwise, `n` is unchanged if `s[i]` was not 1, otherwise `n` is increased by 1 before this operation.**
