Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input in a way that expects a space-separated list of integers, which does not match the problem description. The problem description specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a single binary string, but it reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the required algorithm to calculate the minimum cost. The current implementation seems to count the cost based on the number of `1`s before each `0`, which is not the correct approach for determining the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves finding the minimum cost to transform the string into a sorted form using cyclic shifts, which is a more complex problem involving dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the first test case: `s = "10"`. The program will read this as a list of integers `[1, 0]` and calculate the cost as `2`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is `2` as explained in the problem statement, but the program's logic is flawed and may not generalize to other cases correctly.
   - For `s = "11000"`, the program will calculate the cost as `9`, which is correct in this specific case but does not guarantee correctness for all cases due to the flawed logic.

To correct the program, the input handling should be adjusted to read binary strings correctly, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost should be implemented properly, possibly using dynamic programming or another suitable algorithm.

Since the program does not correctly handle the input and does not implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost, it is considered incorrect.
