Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer. `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the second element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, the second element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the third element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the third element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` if `space_x > remaining_cells`; otherwise, `extra_space` is 0, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x > remaining_cells`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
