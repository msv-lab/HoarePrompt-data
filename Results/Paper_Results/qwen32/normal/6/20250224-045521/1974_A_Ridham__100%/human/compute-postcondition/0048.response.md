The given code snippet recalculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the current values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this calculation.

Let's break down the impact of the code:
- The value of `remaining_cells` is recalculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

Since the value of `remaining_cells` is directly recalculated and the other variables are not affected by this code snippet, we can provide the updated output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the second element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
