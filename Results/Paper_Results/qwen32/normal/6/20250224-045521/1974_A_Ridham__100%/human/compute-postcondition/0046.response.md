The code snippet `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` directly updates the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Given the initial state, this change will affect the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the elements of the `result` list.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the second element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `screen_require_for_y` is now explicitly set to `y // 2 + 1`, which impacts the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the elements of the `result` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
