Postcondition: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**
