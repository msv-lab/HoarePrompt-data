The code snippet provided takes a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns these integers to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state mentions that `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 0, and `result` is an empty list. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input, while `t`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list.**
