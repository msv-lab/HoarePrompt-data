The code snippet provided calculates the value of `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15. The value of `extra_space` is derived from the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.
- `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `extra_space % 15 == 0`.

The code modifies the value of `extra_screen` as `extra_space // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_space % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`.**
