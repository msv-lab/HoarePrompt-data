To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the application icons according to the problem description.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - It calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
   - It calculates the total space required (`total_space`).

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
     - If `y` (number of 2x2 icons) is even, it places them optimally in `y // 2` screens.
     - If `y` is odd, it places them in `y // 2 + 1` screens.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - It calculates the remaining cells in the screens used for 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`).

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons, it uses the screens already calculated for 2x2 icons.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the extra space needed for the 1x1 icons and adds additional screens as required.

Let's consider the logic for handling the 2x2 icons first. The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for placing 2x2 icons, but it doesn't consider the optimal placement of these icons on the screens. Each screen can have a maximum of 15 cells, and the 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each. However, the program assumes that each screen used for 2x2 icons is fully utilized, which might not always be the case.

For example, if `y = 1`, the program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as 1, but it doesn't consider the possibility of placing more 1x1 icons on the remaining 11 cells of that screen.

Next, let's consider the handling of 1x1 icons. The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into these remaining cells. If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons.

However, the program doesn't consider the possibility of placing the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells of the screens used for 2x2 icons optimally. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Let's take a closer look at the test cases provided:

- For the third test case (`x = 12`, `y = 4`), the program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as 2 (which is correct). However, it calculates `remaining_cells` as 0, which is incorrect because there are 11 remaining cells in the second screen. As a result, it calculates the number of screens required as 2, which is correct, but it doesn't consider the possibility of placing the 12 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

- For the last test case (`x = 0`, `y = 9`), the program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as 5, which is correct. However, it doesn't consider the possibility of placing more 1x1 icons in the remaining cells of the screens used for 2x2 icons, which is not an issue in this case because there are no 1x1 icons.

Based on the analysis, the program doesn't always calculate the minimum number of screens required correctly due to the incorrect handling of the remaining cells and the optimal placement of icons.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
