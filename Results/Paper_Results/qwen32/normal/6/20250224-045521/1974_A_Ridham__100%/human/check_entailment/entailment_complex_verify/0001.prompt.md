You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) where x is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.

    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))

            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: result is a list containing the number of screens required for each of the t test cases, n is 0, and x and y are the values from the last test case.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. It calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all applications for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it to the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells in total).

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since a screen is 15 cells, we need to determine how many screens are required to fit the 2x2 icons.
2. **1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, we need to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells. If there are not enough cells, we need additional screens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.
2. **Calculating Space Requirements**:
    - `space_x` is the total number of cells required for 1x1 icons.
    - `space_y` is the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons.
3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
    - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up. This is correct because each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons (12 cells), and any leftover 2x2 icons will require an additional screen.
4. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
    - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens.
5. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
    - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, the program adds the number of screens used for 2x2 icons to the result.
    - If not, it calculates the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons and adds this to the result.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Remaining Cells**: The program checks if the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons are sufficient for 1x1 icons. However, it does not account for the possibility of placing 1x1 icons in partially filled screens where 2x2 icons are placed.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where `y` is 0 or `x` is 0, but the logic should still work correctly in these cases.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:
- **Test Case 1**: (1, 1) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 2**: (7, 2) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 3**: (12, 4) -> Should output 2 screens.
- **Test Case 4**: (0, 3) -> Should output 2 screens.
- **Test Case 5**: (1, 0) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 6**: (8, 1) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 7**: (0, 0) -> Should output 0 screens.
- **Test Case 8**: (2, 0) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 9**: (15, 0) -> Should output 1 screen.
- **Test Case 10**: (8, 2) -> Should output 2 screens.
- **Test Case 11**: (0, 9) -> Should output 5 screens.

The program seems to handle these test cases correctly based on the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
