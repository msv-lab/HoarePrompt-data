Postcondition: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `y` is even, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.**
