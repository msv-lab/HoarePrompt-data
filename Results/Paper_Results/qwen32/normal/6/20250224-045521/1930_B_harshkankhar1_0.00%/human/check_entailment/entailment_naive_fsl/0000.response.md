Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly generate the required permutation for all cases. The code currently reverses the elements at even indices, but this approach does not guarantee that there do not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

Let's analyze the given code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Reversing Even Indices**: The code reverses the elements at even indices. While this might work for some small values of \(n\), it does not guarantee the required condition for all values of \(n\).
2. **General Case Failure**: The code does not handle larger values of \(n\) correctly. For example, consider \(n = 6\). The output of the code would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` with even indices reversed resulting in `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. However, this permutation is invalid because \(p_1 = 3\) divides \(p_3 = 1\) and \(p_2 = 2\) divides \(p_4 = 4\).

### Counterexample:
For \(n = 6\):
- The code would output: `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]`
- Invalid because \(3\) divides \(1\) and \(2\) divides \(4\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would be to construct a permutation that avoids the condition \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). One such approach is to interleave odd and even numbers in a specific manner. For example, for \(n = 6\), a valid permutation could be `[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]`.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
