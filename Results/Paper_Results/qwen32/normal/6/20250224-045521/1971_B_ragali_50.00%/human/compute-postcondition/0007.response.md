The code `a.add(i)` adds the second character of the string `s` to the set `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `a` will contain the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces and must have at least 1 character, `a` is a set containing the second character of `s`, `i` is the second character in the string `s`.**
