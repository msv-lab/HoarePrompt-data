Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces.
3. `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` and has more than one element.
4. `i` is the last character of `s`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, or `i`. These variables are not used in the `print` statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
