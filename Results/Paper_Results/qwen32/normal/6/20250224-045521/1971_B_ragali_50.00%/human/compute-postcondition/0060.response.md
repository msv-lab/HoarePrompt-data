The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the remaining characters in the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `s` (the third character).

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`, `i` is the third character of `s`**
