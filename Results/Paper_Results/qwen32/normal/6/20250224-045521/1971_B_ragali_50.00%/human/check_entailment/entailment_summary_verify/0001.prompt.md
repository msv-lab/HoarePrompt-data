You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and attempts to print a modified version of the string, which could be a rotated version or the reverse of the string, depending on certain conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given a string `s`, we need to determine if we can rearrange its characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If such a rearrangement is possible, we should output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r`. If it's not possible, we should output "NO".

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Checking Unique Characters:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. The length of this set `len(a)` indicates the number of unique characters in `s`.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If `len(a) > 1`, it means there are at least two different characters in `s`, so it's possible to rearrange the string to get a different string:
     - It tries to create a new string by splitting `s` in half and swapping the halves: `newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`.
     - It checks if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints "YES" and `newstr`.
     - If `newstr` is the same as `s`, it checks if the reverse of `s` (`isreverse = s[::-1]`) is different from `s`. If it is, it prints "YES" and `isreverse`.
     - If neither `newstr` nor the reverse of `s` is different from `s`, it prints "YES" and a rearrangement `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`. However, this rearrangement is the same as `newstr`, so this case should not occur.

   - If `len(a) == 1`, it means all characters in `s` are the same, so it's impossible to rearrange the string to get a different string. It prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

- **Case 1: `len(a) > 1`**
  - The program correctly identifies that rearrangement is possible.
  - It tries to create a new string by splitting `s` in half and swapping the halves. This approach works if the length of `s` is greater than 1.
  - It checks if the new string is different from the original. If not, it tries the reverse of `s`.
  - If neither works, it falls back to the same method again, which is redundant and unnecessary.

- **Case 2: `len(a) == 1`**
  - The program correctly identifies that rearrangement is impossible and outputs "NO".

### Issues
- The fallback rearrangement `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` is redundant and unnecessary since it is the same as `newstr`.
- The program does not handle the case where `len(s) == 1` explicitly, but since `len(a) == 1` covers this, it works correctly in this scenario.

### Conclusion
The program is mostly correct but has a redundant step. It correctly identifies whether a rearrangement is possible and provides a valid rearrangement when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
