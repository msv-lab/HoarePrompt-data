To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the given output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer from the input. For each iteration, it performs the following:
1. Takes a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. Creates a set `a` containing all unique characters from `s`.
3. Checks if the length of `a` is greater than 1.
   - If true, it prints 'YES', then checks if the rotated string `newstr` (second half moved to front) is different from `s`. If different, it prints `newstr`. If not, it checks if the reversed string `isreverse` is different from `s`. If different, it prints `isreverse`. If `isreverse` is also equal to `s`, it prints `newstr` again.
   - If false, it prints 'NO'.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the string `s` has been processed as described above.

### Final Output State:
- `t` iterations have been completed.
- For each of these iterations, the string `s` was processed, and the appropriate print statements were executed based on the conditions outlined in the loop.
- The state of `t` and any strings `s` provided as input remain as per the input values, as the loop does not modify `t` and only processes `s` within each iteration.

### Output State in Natural Language:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state is that `t` iterations have been completed. For each iteration, the string `s` was processed to check the uniqueness of its characters and then printed according to the specified conditions. The initial value of `t` and the strings `s` provided as input remain unchanged.

Output State: **t iterations have been completed, and for each iteration, the string s was processed according to the specified conditions.**
