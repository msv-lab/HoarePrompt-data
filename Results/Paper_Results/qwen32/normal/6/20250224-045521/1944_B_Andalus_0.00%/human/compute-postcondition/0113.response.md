The code snippet provided is `sz += 1`, which increments the value of `sz` by 1. Given the initial state, `sz` is initially `k + 1`. After the increment, `sz` becomes `k + 2`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, `sz` is `k + 2`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
