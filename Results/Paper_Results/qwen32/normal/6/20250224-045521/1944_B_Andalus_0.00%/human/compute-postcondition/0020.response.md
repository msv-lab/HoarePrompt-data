The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 2, the element `lft[2]` is added to `ldb`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains `lft[2]`, `sng` remains unchanged, `rdb` remains an empty list, `i` is 2.**
