The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `sng`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `sz`, `T`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**
