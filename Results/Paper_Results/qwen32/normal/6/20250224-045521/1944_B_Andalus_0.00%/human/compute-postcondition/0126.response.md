The code snippet provided simply reassigns an empty list `[]` to the variable `rdb`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `rdb` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is `lst[n:]`, `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.**
