Postcondition: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.**
