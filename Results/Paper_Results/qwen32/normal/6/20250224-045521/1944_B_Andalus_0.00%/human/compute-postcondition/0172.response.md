To determine the output of the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is defined.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **T**: An integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
3. **n**: An integer provided as `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
4. **k**: An integer provided as `input_k`.
5. **lst**: A list of integers provided by user input.
6. **lft**: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
7. **rgt**: The elements of `lst` starting from the `n`-th element to the end, sorted in ascending order.
8. **i**: Set to `n-1`.
9. **ldb**: Contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it.
10. **sng**: Contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them.
11. **rdb**: Contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
12. **sz**: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be used in a loop condition.
13. **elem**: The next element in `ldb` after `elem_current`.

### Analysis:
- `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them. This means that `ldb` is a list of elements that appear consecutively at least twice in the sorted list `lft`.
- `elem` is defined as the next element in `ldb` after `elem_current`. This implies that `elem` is an element from `ldb`.

### Output:
The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is an element from `ldb`, and `ldb` contains elements that have at least one duplicate next to them in `lft`, `elem` will be one such element.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from `ldb`, which contains elements from `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them)**
