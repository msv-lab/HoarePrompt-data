To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed. 

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is 3.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `rgt` is `[4, 5]`.
- `ldb` is `[]`.
- `sng` is `[2]`.
- `rdb` is `[]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `sz` is `k + 1`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. This implies that `elem` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided. Since the task is to determine the output based on the given information, we need to make a reasonable assumption about where `elem` might come from.

Given the context, `elem` could be an element from one of the lists mentioned in the initial state, such as `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb`. However, without additional context, the most reasonable assumption would be that `elem` is an element from the list `lst` since it is the most comprehensive list provided.

Since `i` is 2, `elem` could potentially be `lst[i]`, which would be `lst[2]` or `3`.

However, since the exact value of `elem` is not determined by the given information, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element that is printed based on the context of the code)**
Since we don't have the exact value of `elem`, we can't provide a numerical value, but we can describe it as an element from one of the lists or a variable defined elsewhere in the code.

Given the provided information, the most precise description we can provide is:
Output: **elem (where elem is an element that is printed based on the context of the code)**

If we assume `elem` is `lst[i]` and `i` is 2, then `elem` would be 3. However, without explicit confirmation, we must stick to the general description.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **elem (where elem is an element that is printed based on the context of the code)**
