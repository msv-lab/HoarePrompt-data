Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: rdb contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the rgt list, and sz is equal to k (or the largest even number less than k if k is odd and all elements in ldb have been processed).
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 1` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 1 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least one element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 3` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 3 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
