The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial values of `n` and `k` are both 3. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input, which we will denote as `input_n` and `input_k` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `lft` is [1, 2, 3], `rgt` is [4, 5], `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3**
