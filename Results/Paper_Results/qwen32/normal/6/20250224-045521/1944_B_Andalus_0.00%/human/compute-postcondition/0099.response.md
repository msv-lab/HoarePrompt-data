To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`T`**: An integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
3. **`n`**: The first integer from the input, and it must be greater than 1.
4. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
5. **`lst`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
6. **`lft`**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **`rgt`**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **`ldb`**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
9. **`sng`**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
10. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element.
11. **`i`**: Set to `n - 1`.
12. **`elem`**: The next element in `rdb`.
13. **`sz`**: Not explicitly defined in the precondition, but it is used to break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Key Points

- `ldb` must contain at least three elements, meaning there are at least three consecutive duplicates in the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element, meaning there is at least one consecutive duplicate in the remaining elements of `lst` after the first `n` elements.
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, which means it is the first element in `rdb` (since `elem` is described as "the next element in `rdb`" without any prior iteration context).

### What is Printed

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

### Conclusion

Given the precondition, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and since `rdb` contains at least one element, `elem` is well-defined. The output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element in rdb)**
