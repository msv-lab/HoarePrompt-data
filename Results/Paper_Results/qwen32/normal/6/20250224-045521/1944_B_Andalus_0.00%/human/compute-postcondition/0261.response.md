Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the `i`-th element of `lft` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`). Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the single element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list, `i` is 2. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.**
