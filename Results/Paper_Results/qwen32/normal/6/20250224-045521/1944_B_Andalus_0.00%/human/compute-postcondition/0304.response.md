The `break` statement will terminate the loop or the block of code it is inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Given the initial state provided, the values of `rdb`, `sz`, `sng`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is equal to `k` (or the largest even number less than `k` if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least one element, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
