To determine what is printed by the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved. However, the given initial state does not specify the exact value of `elem` at the point where this print statement is executed. Therefore, we need to infer the likely scenario based on the given conditions and the context.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `T`: An integer greater than or equal to 1 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 5000 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `n`: The first integer from the input, greater than 1.
   - `k`: The second integer from the input.
   - `lst`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `lft`: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt`: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
   - `ldb`: A list containing all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, with at least three elements.
   - `sng`: A list containing all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
   - `rdb`: A list containing all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, with at least one element.
   - `i`: Set to `n - 1`.
   - `sz`: A non-negative integer, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Additionally, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`. This means that the value of `elem` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and without a newline character at the end.

3. **Determining the Value of `elem`:**
   - The value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rgt`, `rdb`) that is being processed in a loop or condition.
   - Since `ldb` and `rdb` contain elements that are duplicates of the previous element, and `sng` contains elements that are unique in their segment, `elem` could be any of these elements depending on the specific part of the code where the print statement is executed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact position in the code where `elem` is defined, we can only say that `elem` is an element from one of the lists mentioned above, and it will be printed twice in the same line.

Given this analysis, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, ldb, sng, rgt, rdb)**
