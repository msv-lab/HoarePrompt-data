The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`rdb`, `ldb`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is now `sz + 2`, which is still less than `k` with the additional condition that `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 2`, and `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0.**
