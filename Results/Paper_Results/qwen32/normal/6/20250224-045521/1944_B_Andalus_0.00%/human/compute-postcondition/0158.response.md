Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `sz` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` includes `rgt[2]`. Additionally, if `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, then `rdb` includes `rgt[3]`.**
