Postcondition: **`rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop. `sng` must contain at least one element.**
