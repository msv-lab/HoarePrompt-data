The code assigns to `rgt` the sublist of `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of the list. This means `rgt` will contain all elements of `lst` that come after the first `n` elements.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.**
