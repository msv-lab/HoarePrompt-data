To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop behaves and what conditions lead to its termination.

From the problem statement, the loop iterates over the elements in `sng`, printing each element and incrementing `sz` by 1 until `sz` is no longer less than `k`. Thus, the loop will execute until `sz` reaches `k` or until all elements in `sng` have been processed, whichever comes first.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that `sng` has at least 3 elements. The loop will continue to execute until `sz` is no longer less than `k`, meaning it will print elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or until there are no more elements in `sng` to print.

**Output State: sz is k or the number of elements in sng, whichever is smaller, and rdb contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the rgt list.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print elements from `sng` until either it has printed `k` elements or it has printed all elements in `sng`. The variable `sz` will reflect the number of elements printed, and `rdb` will remain unchanged as it only contains duplicates from `rgt` and is not affected by the loop.
