Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the `i`-th element of `lft` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`). Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the single element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` (where `i` is 2), then `ldb` contains the `i`-th element of `lft` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`). Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes the element `lft[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
