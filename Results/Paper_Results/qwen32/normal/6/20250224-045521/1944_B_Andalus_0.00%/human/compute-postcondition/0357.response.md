Postcondition: **`rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz >= k`, the loop or the most internal block of code is exited. `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the `k`-th element. If `sz < k`, the execution continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
