To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1` (inclusive), and it checks the values of `lft[i]` against its neighbors `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]` to decide whether to append `lft[i]` to `ldb` or `sng`.

### Natural Language Explanation

- **`ldb` (Duplicate List)**: This list will contain all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate right next to them.
- **`sng` (Single List)**: This list will contain all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates right next to them.
- **`rdb` (Right Duplicate List)**: This list remains empty as per the given loop logic.

The loop checks each element in `lft` from the second to the second last element:
- If `lft[i]` is the same as `lft[i - 1]`, it is added to `ldb`.
- If `lft[i]` is not the same as `lft[i - 1]` and not the same as `lft[i + 1]`, it is added to `sng`.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes, `ldb` will contain all elements in `lft` that have duplicates next to them, and `sng` will contain all unique elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates next to them. The variable `rdb` remains empty.

### Output State in the Required Format

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n`, and `sz` is 3. `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` is empty.**
