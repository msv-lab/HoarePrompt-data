Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `rdb`, `ldb`, `sz`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
