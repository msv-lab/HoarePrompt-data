Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `lst`. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
