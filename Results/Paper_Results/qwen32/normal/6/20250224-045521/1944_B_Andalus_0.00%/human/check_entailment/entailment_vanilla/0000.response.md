Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to split the array `a` into two subarrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` each, such that:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of all elements in `l` should equal the bitwise XOR of all elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Elements**:
   - The program identifies elements in `lft` and `rgt`:
     - `ldb`: Elements that appear twice in `lft`.
     - `rdb`: Elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
     - `sng`: Elements in `lft` that appear only once.

4. **Constructing Subarrays `l` and `r`**:
   - The program constructs `l` and `r` by first adding pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` (since they have no effect on the XOR due to `x ^ x = 0`).
   - After adding pairs, if more elements are needed, it adds elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r` until the required length `2k` is reached.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling Single Elements**:
   - The program uses `sng` elements from `lft` but does not handle single elements from `rgt`.
   - This can lead to cases where `l` and `r` do not have the same number of elements, or the XOR condition is not met.

2. **XOR Condition**:
   - The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   - Adding single elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r` does not guarantee the XOR condition, especially when the number of single elements is odd.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` without ensuring that the total number of elements is exactly `2k`.
   - It may print fewer than `2k` elements if the number of pairs and single elements is insufficient.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly ensure that the XOR condition is met for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
