Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, and `sz` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is `[lft[2]]` and `sng` and `rdb` are both empty. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is empty, `sng` is `[lft[i]]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` is empty, and `rdb` is empty.**
