Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element. `i` is 2. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` is a list containing `rgt[2]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains an empty list.**
