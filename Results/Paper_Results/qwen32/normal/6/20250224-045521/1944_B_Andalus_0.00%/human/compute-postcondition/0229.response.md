The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`. Since the loop iterates over `sng`, the state of `elem` will change with each iteration to the next element in `sng`. The iterable `sng` itself does not change; it simply provides the elements one by one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 1`
- `sng` is an iterable with at least one element

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element after the current `elem`. Since `sz` is not directly involved in the loop condition (the loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`), the value of `sz` does not need to be adjusted. The only change needed is to move to the next element in `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 1`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
