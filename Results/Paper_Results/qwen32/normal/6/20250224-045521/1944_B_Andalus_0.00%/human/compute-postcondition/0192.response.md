To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the relevant parts of the initial state:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
   - `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is `input_k`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element.
   - `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 1.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - `print(elem, end=' ')` prints the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline.

Given the description, `elem` is specifically defined as the next element in the list `sng`, which contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element. Therefore, the value of `elem` is determined by the elements in `lft` that are unique with respect to their neighbors.

### Final Output

The print statement will output the next element in `sng`, which is the next unique element in the first `n` elements of `lst` (sorted in ascending order) that does not have any duplicates next to it.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next unique element in the first `n` elements of `lst` that does not have any duplicates next to it)**
