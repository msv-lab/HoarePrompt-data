Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
2. `ldb` contains at least one more element after `elem`.
3. `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.
4. `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.
5. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.
- The value of `elem` is described as "the next element in `ldb`". This means `elem` holds the value of the current element being processed from the `ldb` list.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information. The print statement will output the value of `elem` twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the `ldb` list)**
