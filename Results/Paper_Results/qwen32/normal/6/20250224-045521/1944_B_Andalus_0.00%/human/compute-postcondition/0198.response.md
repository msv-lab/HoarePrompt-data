Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 3, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the code following the if-else block.**

In natural language: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `sz + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
