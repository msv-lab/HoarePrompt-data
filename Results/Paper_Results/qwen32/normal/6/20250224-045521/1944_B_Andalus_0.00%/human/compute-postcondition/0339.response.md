Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and the print statement:

- `rdb` is a list that contains at least one element.
- `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4.
- The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, but this detail is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb` to be processed.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not end the line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

Since `elem` is specified to be the next element in `rdb`, we don't have the exact value of `elem` from the initial state. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the list `rdb`)**
