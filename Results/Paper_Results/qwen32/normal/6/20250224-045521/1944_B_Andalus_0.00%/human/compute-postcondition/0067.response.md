To determine the exact output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is used. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **T**: An integer such that \( T \geq 1 \).
2. **t**: An integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \).
3. **n**: The first integer from the input, and \( n > 1 \).
4. **k**: The second integer from the input.
5. **lst**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
6. **lft**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **rgt**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **ldb**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
9. **sng**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least one element.
10. **rdb**: Contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
11. **i**: Set to \( n - 1 \).
12. **sz**: Set to 6. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Focus on the `print(elem, end=' ')` Statement:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement suggests that `elem` is being printed in a loop, and the `end=' '` argument indicates that the output will be space-separated.

### Determining `elem`:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the context. Given the variables and lists defined, `elem` is likely an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`).

However, the exact context in which `elem` is used (i.e., which list it is from and how it is being iterated over) is not provided. Without this information, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its possible sources.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `elem` is from `lft`**:
   - `elem` could be any element from the sorted list `lft`.
2. **If `elem` is from `ldb`**:
   - `elem` would be one of the elements in `ldb`, which are duplicates of the previous element in `lft` and must contain at least three elements.
3. **If `elem` is from `sng`**:
   - `elem` would be one of the elements in `sng`, which are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element in `lft` and must contain at least one element.
4. **If `elem` is from `rgt`**:
   - `elem` could be any element from the sorted list `rgt`.
5. **If `elem` is from `rdb`**:
   - `elem` would be one of the elements in `rdb`, which are duplicates of the previous element in `rgt`.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact loop or context in which `elem` is being used, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its possible sources. The most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rgt`, `rdb`).

Therefore, the output will be an element from one of these lists, space-separated.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists lft, ldb, sng, rgt, or rdb)**
