Postcondition: **`elem` is the third element of `ldb`. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes occur to `sz`. The condition regarding the breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the comparison between `sz` and `k` remains unchanged.**
