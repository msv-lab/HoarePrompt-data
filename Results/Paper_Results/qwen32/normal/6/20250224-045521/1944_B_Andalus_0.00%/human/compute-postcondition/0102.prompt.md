Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. No other changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
