The code snippet `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` will replace the existing `lst` with a new list of integers provided by the user input. The previous values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `i`, and `sz` remain unchanged. The new value of `lst` will be a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is [1, 2, 3], `rgt` is [4, 5], `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.**
