### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by determining a distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.

2. **Calculate the Product of Multipliers**: For each test case, the program calculates the product of all the multipliers (`m = m * k[i]`).

3. **Determine Individual Bets**: The program then calculates individual bets for each outcome by dividing the total product by each multiplier (`c.append(int(m / k[i]))`). This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the return will be exactly `k[i] * c[i] = m`.

4. **Simplify Bets Using GCD**: The program calculates the GCD of the individual bets (`c`) to simplify the bets while maintaining the condition that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. This is done by dividing each bet by the GCD (`c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)`).

5. **Check Feasibility**: The program checks if the total of the simplified bets is less than the product of multipliers divided by the GCD (`sum(c) < m / hcf`). If not, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists. Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of the list `c`, which is correct. However, the comment in the code is incorrect as it mentions the GCD of the number of test cases `t` and all the integers that follow it in the list `numbers`, which is not relevant to the calculation.

- **Feasibility Check**: The condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. It should be `sum(c) >= m / hcf` to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, but the condition is negated in the code (`if sum(c) >= m / hcf: print(-1)`), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is correct, and the implementation is accurate based on the problem description and the annotated states. The comment about the GCD function is misleading but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness: **True**
