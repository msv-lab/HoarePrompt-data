Output State: **`hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `numbers[3]`; `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data; `num` is `numbers[3]`.**

Explanation: The value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of its previous value and `numbers[3]`. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
