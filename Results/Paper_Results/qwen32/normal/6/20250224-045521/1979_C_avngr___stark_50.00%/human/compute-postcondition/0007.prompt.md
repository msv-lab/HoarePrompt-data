Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `numbers`, which represents the number of test cases; `numbers` is a list of integers where the first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `num`; `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data; `num` is `numbers[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `numbers[3]`; `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data; `num` is `numbers[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
