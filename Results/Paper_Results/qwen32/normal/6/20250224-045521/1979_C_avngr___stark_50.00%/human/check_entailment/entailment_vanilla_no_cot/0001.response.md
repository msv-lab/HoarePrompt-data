### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by distributing the bets in a way that ensures the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, given the multipliers \( k_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the list of multipliers \( k \).

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k \) by multiplying them all together. This is stored in the variable `m`.
   - The LCM is used because it ensures that when divided by any \( k_i \), the resulting value will be an integer, which is necessary for the bets to be valid integers.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the initial bet as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet multiplied by \( k_i \) will be exactly equal to \( m \).

4. **Reducing the Bets:**
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of these initial bets.
   - It then divides each bet by the HCF to reduce the bets while maintaining the condition that the total bet multiplied by any \( k_i \) is still greater than the total bet.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than the reduced \( m \) (which is \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \)).
   - If the sum of the bets is not less than the reduced \( m \), it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the reduced bets.

6. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome by leveraging the properties of LCM and HCF.
   - The constraints and the problem requirements are satisfied by this approach.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
