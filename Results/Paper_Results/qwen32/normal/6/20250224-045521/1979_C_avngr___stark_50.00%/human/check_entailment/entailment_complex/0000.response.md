### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem by distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k` for each test case. This product represents a common multiple that can be used to distribute the bets.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program generates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet `sum(c)` will be strictly less than `k[i] * c[i]`.

4. **Simplifying the Bets:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` and divides each element of `c` by this GCD. This step is to ensure that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the required condition.

5. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets `sum(c)` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the bets are valid, and the program prints them. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic of distributing the bets as `m / k[i]` ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet `sum(c)` will be strictly less than `k[i] * c[i]` because `k[i] * c[i] = k[i] * (m / k[i]) = m`.
  - Simplifying the bets by dividing by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized but still satisfy the condition.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is a valid check to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of the list `c`. This is essential for simplifying the bets.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets according to the problem's requirements. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the bets are minimized while satisfying the condition.

**Correctness: True**
