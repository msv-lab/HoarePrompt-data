#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `hcf` is the GCD of the number of test cases `t` and all the integers that follow it in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the GCD of the number of test cases `t` and all the integers that follow it in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first integer `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by integers that are part of these test cases. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list.
