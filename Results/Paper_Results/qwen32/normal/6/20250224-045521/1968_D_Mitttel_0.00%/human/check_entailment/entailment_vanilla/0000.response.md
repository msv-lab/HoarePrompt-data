Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case with the appropriate parameters and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   
2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function takes parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score()` with their starting positions.
   - It compares the scores and returns "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

3. **Function `calculate_score()`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0, `current_pos` to the starting position, `steps` to 0, and `visited` as an empty dictionary to track visited positions.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to `score` and updating `current_pos` to `p[current_pos - 1]`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., `current_pos` has been visited before), it calculates the cycle length and score.
   - It then calculates the remaining steps after the cycle starts, determines how many full cycles can be completed, and adds the corresponding score.
   - Finally, it adds the score for the remaining steps after the full cycles.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle starts.
- **Score Calculation**: It correctly calculates the score for the initial steps before any cycle is detected and adds the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.
- **Comparison**: The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the correct result.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
