### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified a critical issue with the global variable `k` not being defined within the `calculate_score` function, which would lead to a `NameError`. This is a significant problem that makes the program incorrect as it stands. Let's break down the reasoning further:

1. **Global Variable `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is used within the `calculate_score` function to determine the number of steps to take. Since `k` is not passed as a parameter to `calculate_score`, it must be a global variable. However, the provided code does not define `k` globally, which will result in a `NameError` when the function tries to use it.

2. **Indexing Off-by-One Error**:
   - The program correctly uses `current_pos - 1` to index into the arrays `a` and `p`, which is appropriate given that the positions in the permutation are 1-based, and Python lists are 0-based.

3. **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation**:
   - The logic for detecting cycles and calculating scores efficiently is correct. The program uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by determining how many full cycles can be completed and the remaining steps after full cycles.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the undefined global variable `k`, the program is not correct as it stands. The global variable `k` needs to be defined or `k` should be passed as a parameter to the `calculate_score` function to avoid the `NameError`.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
