The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used inside the loop. Since `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not affect the program state, and we do not need to adjust it.

However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `remainder_steps` to be at least 1, as the loop will iterate for each value in the range of `remainder_steps`.

Given the information:
- `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, so it should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. To be precise and adhere to the format, we can state that `remainder_steps` should be 1 for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is 1; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is 1.**
