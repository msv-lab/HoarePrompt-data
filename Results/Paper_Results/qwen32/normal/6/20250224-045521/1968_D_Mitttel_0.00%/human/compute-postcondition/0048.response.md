To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables Derivation from `data` List:**
   - `n` is derived from the index `1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)` in the `data` list.
   - `k` is derived from the index `2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)` in the `data` list.
   - `PB` is derived from the index `3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)` in the `data` list.
   - `PS` is derived from the index `4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)` in the `data` list.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from the index `5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)` to `5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1` in the `data` list.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the index `5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)` to `5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1` in the `data` list.

2. **Additional Variables:**
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`.
   - `t` is given as 1.
   - `results` is a list containing at least two results, including the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and another result.

### Analysis:

- Since `t` is 1, the calculations for the indices simplify:
  - `n` is derived from `data[1 + 4(1-1) + 2n(1-2)]` which simplifies to `data[1 + 0 + 2n(-1)]` or `data[1 - 2n]`. However, since `n` is not yet known, we will denote it as `data[1]` for the first iteration.
  - `k` is derived from `data[2 + 4(1-1) + 2n(1-2)]` which simplifies to `data[2 + 0 + 2n(-1)]` or `data[2 - 2n]`. Similarly, we denote it as `data[2]`.
  - `PB` is derived from `data[3 + 4(1-1) + 2n(1-2)]` which simplifies to `data[3 + 0 + 2n(-1)]` or `data[3 - 2n]`. We denote it as `data[3]`.
  - `PS` is derived from `data[4 + 4(1-1) + 2n(1-2)]` which simplifies to `data[4 + 0 + 2n(-1)]` or `data[4 - 2n]`. We denote it as `data[4]`.
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[5 + 4(1-1) + 2n(1-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(1-1) + 3n(1-2) - 1]` which simplifies to `data[5 + 0 + 2n(-1)]` to `data[5 + 0 + 3n(-1) - 1]` or `data[5 - 2n]` to `data[4 - 3n]`. We denote it as `data[5:5+n-1]`.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[5 + 4(1-1) + 3n(1-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(1-1) + 4n(1-2) - 1]` which simplifies to `data[5 + 0 + 3n(-1)]` to `data[5 + 0 + 4n(-1) - 1]` or `data[5 - 3n]` to `data[4 - 4n]`. We denote it as `data[5+n:5+2n-1]`.

- The `index` is calculated as `1 + 4*1 + 2*n*(1-1)` which simplifies to `1 + 4 + 0` or `5`.

- The `results` list contains at least two results, one of which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

### Output Statement:

The `print(result)` statement is ambiguous because it refers to `result` which is not defined in the given initial state. However, based on the context, it is likely that `result` is intended to be one of the elements from the `results` list. Given the information, the most logical assumption is that `result` is the first element of the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Since the exact value of `result` depends on the return value of `func_1`, and this function is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

### Final Output:

Output: **result (where result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`)**
