You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the inputs `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It initializes the score and the current position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them.
   - It iterates until `k` steps are taken or a cycle is detected.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by determining how many full cycles can be completed and the remaining steps after full cycles.
   - It returns the final score.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads all input data at once and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - It prints all results after processing all test cases.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variable `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is used within the `calculate_score` function, but it is not passed as a parameter to this function.
   - This means that `k` must be a global variable, which is not defined anywhere in the provided code.
   - This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Indexing Off-by-One Error**:
   - The program uses `current_pos - 1` to index into the arrays `a` and `p`.
   - This is correct if the positions in the permutation are 1-based, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - However, this should be explicitly checked and ensured by the logic.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases with a total of 2 * 10^5 elements in the permutation and array.
   - The logic to detect cycles and calculate scores efficiently handles large values of `k` by optimizing the number of calculations after a cycle is detected.
   - This part of the program seems correct and efficient.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, particularly the undefined global variable `k`, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
