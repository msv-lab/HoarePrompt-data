The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` by converting the string at `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given that `index` is 1, `k` will be assigned the integer value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `results` is an empty list.**
