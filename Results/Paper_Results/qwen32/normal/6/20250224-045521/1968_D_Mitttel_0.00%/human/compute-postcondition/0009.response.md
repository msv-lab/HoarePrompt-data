The code snippet `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `PB` is updated to the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is a positive integer representing the starting position of Sasha, such that 1 <= PS <= n, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `results` is an empty list.**
