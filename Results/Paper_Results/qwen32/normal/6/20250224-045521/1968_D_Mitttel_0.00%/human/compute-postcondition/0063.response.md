The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable and typically not used within the loop body). Since the loop iterates `remainder_steps` times, and we are at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `remainder_steps` to reflect that one iteration has just started.

Given that `remainder_steps` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after one iteration, `remainder_steps` would be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `remainder_steps` should be 0, and the loop will not execute again because `remainder_steps` will no longer be greater than 0.

State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is 0; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is 0.**
