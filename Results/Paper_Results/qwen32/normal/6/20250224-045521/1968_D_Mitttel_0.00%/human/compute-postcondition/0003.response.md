The code snippet assigns the integer value of the element at index 0 of the list `data` to the variable `t`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 0. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
