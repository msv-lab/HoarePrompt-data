Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not pass the `k`, `p`, and `a` parameters to the `calculate_score` function. As a result, the `calculate_score` function does not have access to these necessary variables, leading to errors and incorrect calculations. 

The `calculate_score` function should be called with `k`, `p`, and `a` as additional arguments:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
