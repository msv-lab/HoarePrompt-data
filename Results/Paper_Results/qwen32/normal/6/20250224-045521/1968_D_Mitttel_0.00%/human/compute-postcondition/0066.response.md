To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the given information about the loop's behavior and the state transitions.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop is iterating through the permutation `p` and adding the scores from the array `a` at the positions determined by `p` to `score`. The loop terminates when `remainder_steps` is 0, meaning no more iterations are needed beyond the detected cycle.

Given that `remainder_steps` is 0 after the third iteration, it indicates that the loop has completed all necessary iterations. Therefore, no further changes to `score` or `current_pos` will occur.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `score` will be the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for the `remainder_steps` iterations.
- `current_pos` will be the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates.
- `steps` will be the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle.
- `visited` will be a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited.
- `cycle_start` will be the step at which a cycle begins.
- `cycle_length` will be `CL`.
- `cycle_score` will be 90.
- `cycle_pos` will be 1.
- `remaining_steps` will be 0.
- `full_cycles` will be `(k - steps) // CL`.
- `remainder_steps` will be 0.

Based on the information provided, the final output state is:

Output State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]` after 3 iterations; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is 0; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop has completed all necessary iterations, and the final `score` includes the sum of the first three elements of the cycle, `current_pos` is the position after three iterations, and `remainder_steps` is 0 indicating no more iterations are needed.
