The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged. Only `results` is modified by appending `result` to it.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + 2n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In simpler terms: The `results` list now includes the `result` value, while all other variables retain their initial values.
