The code snippet provided is:
```python
p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
```

This line of code updates the list `p` by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`
- `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`
- `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`
- `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input
- `index` is `13 + 4n`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

The variable `p` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `13 + 4n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In simple terms, the list `p` is now a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, and the list `a` remains the same as `p` after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
