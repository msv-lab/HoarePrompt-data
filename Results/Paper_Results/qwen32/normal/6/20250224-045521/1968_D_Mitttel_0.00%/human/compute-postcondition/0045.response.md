In this task, the loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `result`. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `result` for the next iteration. However, since the `results` list only contains one element, the loop will not execute again after the first iteration. Thus, no adjustment is needed to the state to ensure another iteration because there are no more elements in `results` to iterate over.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
