Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. The function returns the final positions of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns based on the given permutation and array.**
