The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` to the integer value of the element at `data[index + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `index` is `9 + 4n`, the new value of `k` will be `int(data[9 + 4n + 1])`, which simplifies to `int(data[10 + 4n])`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In natural language: The value of `k` is now the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
