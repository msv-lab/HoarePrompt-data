Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) representing the elements of the array. The function processes these test cases and returns a list [6, 13, 3, 3].**
