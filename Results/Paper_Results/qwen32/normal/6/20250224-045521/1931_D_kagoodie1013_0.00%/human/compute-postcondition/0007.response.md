The provided code snippet calculates the modulus of `num` by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. However, the variables `num` and `y` are not defined in the initial state. Given the initial state, we can infer that `num` and `y` might be part of the tuple in `test_cases`. Assuming the first tuple in `test_cases` is being processed, `num` would be 3 and `y` would be 7.

Let's calculate `mod_y` using these values:
- `num % y` = `3 % 7` = 3

Thus, `mod_y` will be 3.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `arr`, `mod_x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 3**.
