Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `6`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 3, 1: 3, 0: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}`.**

Natural language explanation: The `results` list now contains the value `6` after appending the value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged.
