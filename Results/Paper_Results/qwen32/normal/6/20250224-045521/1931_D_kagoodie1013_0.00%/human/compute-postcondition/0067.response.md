The code calculates `mod_y` as the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. Given the initial state, `num` is the first element of `arr`, which is 1 for the first test case and 6 for the second test case, and `y` is 8.

- For the first test case, `num` is 1, so `mod_y = 1 % 8 = 1`.
- For the second test case, `num` is 6, so `mod_y = 6 % 8 = 6`.

Since the code only modifies `mod_y`, the other variables retain their initial values. The specific value of `mod_y` depends on the test case being processed, but since the initial state does not specify which test case is being processed, we will provide the possible values for `mod_y` based on the given test cases.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is 3; `mod_y` is either 1 or 6.**
