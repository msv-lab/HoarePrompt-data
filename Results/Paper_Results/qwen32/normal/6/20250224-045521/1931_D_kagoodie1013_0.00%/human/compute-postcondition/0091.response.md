The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is 3, so 3 is added to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13, 3]; `count` is 3; `mod_x_map` is {2: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1, 1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {6: 1, 7: 1, 0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].**
