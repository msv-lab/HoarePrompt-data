Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{}`; `mod_y_map` is `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mod_x_map = {}` reassigns `mod_x_map` to an empty dictionary. All other variables retain their initial values.
