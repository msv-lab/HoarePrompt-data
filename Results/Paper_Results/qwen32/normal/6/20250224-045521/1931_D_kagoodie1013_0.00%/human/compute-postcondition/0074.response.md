Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `mod_x` is recalculated as `-num % x`. Here, `num` is the second element of `arr`, which is `2` (since `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` for the first test case and `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` for the second test case). The variable `x` is `4`.

Let's calculate `mod_x` for both test cases:

1. For the first test case (`arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`):
   - `num` is `2`
   - `mod_x` is `-2 % 4`, which equals `2` (since `-2 % 4` in Python is `2`).

2. For the second test case (`arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`):
   - `num` is `7`
   - `mod_x` is `-7 % 4`, which equals `1` (since `-7 % 4` in Python is `1`).

Since the initial state specifies that `test_cases` contains two tuples and the code does not change any other variables except `mod_x`, we can derive the output state for both test cases.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {1: 1} or {6: 1} or {1: 2} or {6: 2}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least two elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x` is either 2 or 1; `mod_y` is either 1 or 6; `mod_x_key` is 1; `mod_y_key` is either 1 or 6`.**
