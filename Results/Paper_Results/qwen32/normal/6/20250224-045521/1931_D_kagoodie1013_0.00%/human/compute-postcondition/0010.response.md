The given code snippet calculates `num % y` and assigns the result to `mod_y_key`. From the initial state, we know that `test_cases` contains a tuple where the fourth element is a list `arr` and the second element is `y`. The initial state specifies that `y` is 3. The first element of the tuple in `test_cases` is `num`, which is 5.

Thus, `mod_y_key` is calculated as `5 % 3`, which equals 2.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `arr`, `mod_x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 3; `mod_y_key` is 2.**
