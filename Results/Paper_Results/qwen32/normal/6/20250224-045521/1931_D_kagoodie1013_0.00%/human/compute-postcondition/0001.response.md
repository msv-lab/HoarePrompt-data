To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple that can be unpacked into these four variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`test_cases`**: This is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **Each tuple**: Each tuple in `test_cases` should contain four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Specifically:
   - `n` should be an integer representing the size of the array.
   - `x` and `y` should be integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers.
   - `arr` should be a list of `n` integers.

Given this, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple that meets these criteria. The `results` list being empty does not affect the execution of the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers; `results` is an empty list.**

To make it more concrete, we can specify that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple:
State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (n, x, y, arr) where `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are integers, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `results` is an empty list.**

Example of a valid `test_cases`:
State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]; `results` is an empty list.**
