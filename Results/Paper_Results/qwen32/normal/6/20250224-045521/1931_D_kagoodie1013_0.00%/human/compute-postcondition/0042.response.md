The code snippet `mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1` updates the `mod_y_map` dictionary by incrementing the value associated with the key `mod_y_key`. Since `mod_y_key` is `5` and `mod_y_map` initially does not have a key `5`, the value defaults to `0` and is then incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `0`; `mod_y` is `6`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `5`.**
