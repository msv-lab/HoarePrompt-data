The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x_key`. Given that `num` is the third element of `arr`, and `x` is 4, we need to determine the value of `num` from the initial state. Since `arr` is a list with at least three elements and `test_cases` includes `arr` values, we can infer that `num` could be 3 (from the first test case) or 8 (from the second test case).

Let's consider both scenarios:

1. If `num` is 3 (from the first test case), then `mod_x_key = 3 % 4 = 3`.
2. If `num` is 8 (from the second test case), then `mod_x_key = 8 % 4 = 0`.

Since `num` can be either 3 or 8 based on the provided test cases, `mod_x_key` can be either 3 or 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is a value between 0 and 5; `mod_x_map` is {1: 2} or {6: 1, 1: 1} or {1: 3} or {6: 2, 1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {1: 1, 2: 1} or {6: 1, 2: 1} or {1: 2, 2: 1} or {6: 2, 2: 1} or {1: 1, 7: 1} or {6: 1, 7: 1} or {1: 2, 7: 1} or {6: 2, 7: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least three elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`; `mod_x` is either 1 or 0; `mod_y` is either 3 or 0; `mod_x_key` is either 3 or 0; `mod_y_key` is either 2 or 7`.**
