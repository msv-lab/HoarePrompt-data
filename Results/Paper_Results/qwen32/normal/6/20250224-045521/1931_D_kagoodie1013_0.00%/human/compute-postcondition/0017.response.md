To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet with the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
mod_x_key = num % x
```

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `count` is 1
- `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`
- `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`
- `arr` must be a list with at least two elements
- `mod_x` is 0
- `mod_y` is 2
- `mod_y_key` is 2
- `num` is the second element of `arr`

Since `num` is the second element of `arr` and `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `num` is `2`. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. Since `x` is not defined, we can infer it from the context or assume it to be a variable that has been defined earlier in the code. However, since `x` is not provided, we will assume `x` to be a variable that has a specific value. For the sake of this example, let's assume `x` is `3` (as it is a common value and fits the context of the problem).

Given this assumption, `mod_x_key` will be calculated as `num % x`, which is `2 % 3`.

Now, let's calculate the result:
- `mod_x_key` is `2 % 3`, which equals `2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x_key` is 2`**.
