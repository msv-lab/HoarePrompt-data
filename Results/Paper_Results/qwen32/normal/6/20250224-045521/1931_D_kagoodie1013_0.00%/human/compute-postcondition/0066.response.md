The code snippet calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. Given that `num` is the first element of `arr` and `arr` has at least one element, we can use the first element of `arr` to determine `num`. For the provided initial state, `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` from the first test case in `test_cases`, so `num` is `1`. Given `x` is `4`, we can compute `mod_x` as `-1 % 4`, which equals `3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is 3**.
