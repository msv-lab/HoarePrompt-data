The `break` statement in the provided code will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, or `lst`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space; the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
