Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ans` is 0; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 0; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first element removed and the element at index 2 removed, if it exists. Otherwise, the length of `lst` is exactly 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 1; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` was not equal to 2, the first element and the element at index 2 (if it existed) were removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 2; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` was not equal to 2, the first element and the element at index 2 (if it existed) were removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
