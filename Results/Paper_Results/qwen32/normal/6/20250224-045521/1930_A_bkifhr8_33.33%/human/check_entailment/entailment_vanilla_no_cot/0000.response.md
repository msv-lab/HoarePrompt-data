Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect List Removal**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are incorrect. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` both evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, which are not the intended indices to remove. The correct way to remove the first two elements would be `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

2. **Logic Error in Loop**: The loop condition and the logic inside the loop are incorrect. The loop should iterate `n` times, and in each iteration, it should take the minimum of the first two elements, add it to the score, and then remove those two elements from the list.

3. **Handling of List Length**: The check `if len(lst) != 2:` is unnecessary and incorrectly placed. The loop should always execute `n` times, and the list should be reduced by two elements in each iteration.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to maximize the minimum pair sum
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]  # Add the smaller of the pair (which will be at even index after sorting)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The list is sorted to ensure that the smallest elements are paired together.
- The loop iterates `n` times, each time adding the smallest element of the pair (which will be at the even index after sorting) to the score.
- The `map` function is used to convert the input string to a list of integers in one step.
