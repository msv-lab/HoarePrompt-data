The code snippet provided adds the minimum of the first two integers in the list `lst` to the variable `ans`. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code has been executed:

- `t` remains an input integer representing the number of test cases.
- `ans_f` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 2.
- `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`.
- `n` remains an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `l` remains an input string.
- `lst` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space, with the first element and the element at index 2 removed if the original length of `lst` was not 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space, with the first element and the element at index 2 removed if the original length of `lst` was not 2.**
