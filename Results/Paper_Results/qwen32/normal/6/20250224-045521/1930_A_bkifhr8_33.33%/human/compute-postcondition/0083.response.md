The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`.
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 2.
- `ans` is updated based on the conditions described.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is the newly input string.
- `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated, and the most internal loop is broken out of.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the number of iterations completed plus 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n * 2`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Since `n` is only used to determine the loop's continuation condition and does not change within the loop, we do not need to adjust `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 3; `ans` is updated based on the conditions described; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated, and the most internal loop is broken out of.**
