Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is 0 plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if `lst` has exactly 2 elements, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` retains its original form with potentially some elements removed; if the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`.**
