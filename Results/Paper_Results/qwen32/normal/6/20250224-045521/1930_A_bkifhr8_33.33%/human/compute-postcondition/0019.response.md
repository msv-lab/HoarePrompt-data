The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space, with the first element and the element at index 2 removed if the original length of `lst` was not 2, except the first element has been removed from `lst`. This means that before the removal, if `lst` had more than 2 elements, the first and third elements (0-indexed) were removed. However, after the first element removal, the list `lst` would have shifted indices.

If `lst` originally had more than 2 elements, the first element was removed, and then the third element (which was originally at index 2) would have been removed, leaving a list that does not have an element at index 2. But the code attempts to remove the element at index 2 from the current `lst`, which might not exist if the original length of `lst` was not more than 2 after the first element removal.

However, if we assume the original `lst` had more than 2 elements and the first and third elements were removed, the current `lst` would have at least 2 elements, and the element at index 2 would still exist before the code execution. After the code execution, the element at index 2 is removed.

Thus, the output state will reflect this change. `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. `lst` will have one less element at index 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space, with the first element and the element at index 2 removed if the original length of `lst` was not 2, except the first element has been removed from `lst`, and the element at index 2 has been removed from `lst`.**
