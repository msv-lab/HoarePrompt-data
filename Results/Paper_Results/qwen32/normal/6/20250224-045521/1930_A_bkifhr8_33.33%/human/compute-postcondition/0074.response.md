The `break` statement will exit the loop it is in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. The length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
