Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`, and the most internal loop is broken out of. If the length of `lst` was not 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` after removing the first and third elements if applicable.**
