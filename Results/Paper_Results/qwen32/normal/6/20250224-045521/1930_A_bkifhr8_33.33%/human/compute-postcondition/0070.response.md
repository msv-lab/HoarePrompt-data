The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[0])` because `0 * 2` is `0`. This means the first element of the list `lst` will be removed. 

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of substrings split by spaces, and its length is not equal to 2. After removing the first element, the length of `lst` will be reduced by 1.

Here's the output state considering the changes:
- `t` remains an input integer representing the number of test cases.
- `ans_f` remains a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`.
- `i` remains the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1.
- `ans` remains 0 plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` before the removal.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` remains the newly input string.
- `lst` is now a list with the first element removed, so its length is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1, `ans` is 0 plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` before the removal, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the newly input string, `lst` is a list with the first element removed.**
