Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers with `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is a positive integer (`t` > 0).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string provided by user input.
- If `n` is equal to 2:
  - If `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'.
  - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'.
- If `n` is not equal to 2:
  - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **NO**
