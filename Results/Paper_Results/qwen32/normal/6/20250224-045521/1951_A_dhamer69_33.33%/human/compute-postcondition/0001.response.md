To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given the condition `t > 0`, the variable `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
