Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the new value provided by the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00', otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. `count_1` is updated to the number of '1's in `s`. Regardless of whether `s.count('11') == 1` is true or false, `count_1` accurately reflects the number of '1's in `s`.**
