Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it checks a string `s` of length `n`. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it prints 'YES' if the number of '1's in `s` is even and there is not exactly one occurrence of '11'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
