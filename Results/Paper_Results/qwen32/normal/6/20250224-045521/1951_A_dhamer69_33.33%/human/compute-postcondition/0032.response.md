To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
2. `t` must be greater than 0.
3. `n` is the input integer.
4. `s` is the new value provided by the user input.
5. If `n` is equal to 2:
   - If `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'.
   - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'.
6. If `n` is not equal to 2:
   - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
   - `count_1` is updated to the number of '1's in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The value 'YES' is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on the values of any variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
