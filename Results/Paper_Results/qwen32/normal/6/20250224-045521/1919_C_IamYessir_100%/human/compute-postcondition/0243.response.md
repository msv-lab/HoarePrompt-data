Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; the length of `a` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for `x`, which has been assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`).
