The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This will change the list `b` and potentially the variable `s` if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of `b` before the append operation. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string.
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `cp` is 0.
- If `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.
- The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.
- `y` is less than `lit[i]`.
- `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.

After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `b` will have one more element, and `y` will be updated to `lit[i]` because `y` is defined as the last element of `b`.

If `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of `b` before the append operation, `s` will be incremented by 1. Since `y` was less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is now the last element of `b`, `s` will indeed be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list of integers with `lit[i]` appended to it; `cp` is 0; if `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`; the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`; `y` is less than `lit[i]`; and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
