Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`. `cp` is 0. If `x` was initially `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > y`, `x` becomes `lit[i]`. If `y` was initially `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` becomes `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `s` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `y` remains the same and `s` remains unchanged. If `x > y`, `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `x` is less than `y` and `b` is updated accordingly. If `x` equals `y`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` retain their original values.**
