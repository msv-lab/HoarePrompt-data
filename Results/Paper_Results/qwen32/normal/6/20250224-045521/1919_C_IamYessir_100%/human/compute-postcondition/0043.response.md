Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before appending, or the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]`, otherwise remains unchanged); `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` (updated to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`); `x` is less than `y`.**
