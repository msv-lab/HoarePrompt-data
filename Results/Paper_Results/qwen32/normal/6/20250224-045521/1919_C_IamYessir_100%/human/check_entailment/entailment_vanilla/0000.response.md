Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` in such a way that the sum of penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` for a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis

The program iterates over each element in the array `a` and assigns it to either subsequence `s` or `t` based on certain conditions. The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

#### Key Points in the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` and `b` are initialized as empty lists.
   - `cp` is initialized to 0, but it is never used in the program.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
   - For each element in `lit` (the input array), the program checks the last elements of `a` and `b`.
   - It then decides whether to append the current element to `a` or `b` based on the comparison between the last elements of `a` and `b` and the current element.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - After splitting the array, the program calculates the penalties for both subsequences `a` and `b`.
   - It sums up the penalties and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are not optimal for minimizing the penalty.
   - The program does not ensure that the subsequences are constructed in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

2. **Lack of Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires an optimal strategy to split the array, which is not implemented in the program.
   - An optimal approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to ensure that the penalties are minimized.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:

- **Input**: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
- **Expected Output**: `3`
- **Program Output**: The program may not correctly split the array to achieve the minimum penalty.

The program's logic does not guarantee the optimal split, and thus, it may not produce the correct minimum penalty for all test cases.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the array to minimize the penalty.

**Correctness: False**
