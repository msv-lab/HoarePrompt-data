The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element in the list `b` to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, `b` can be either an empty list or not an empty list. However, the problem statement specifies that `i` is 4, which implies that there are at least 5 elements in `lit` (since `i` is an index starting from 0). This means that `b` must have been populated with at least one element by the time this line is executed, as `b` is updated whenever `lit[i] > y`.

Since `b` is not empty at this point, `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`. Therefore, `y` is updated to this last element.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`, `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `i` is 4.**
