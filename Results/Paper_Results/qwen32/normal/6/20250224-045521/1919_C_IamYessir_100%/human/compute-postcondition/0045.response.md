Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list with the new element `lit[i]` appended if `x` equals `y`, otherwise `a` contains elements from `lit` where each element is less than or equal to `x`; `b` is either an empty list or contains elements from `lit` where each element is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y` if `x` does not equal `y`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `x` equals `y`, otherwise `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**
