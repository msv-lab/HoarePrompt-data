The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` but does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or the condition determining `y`.

Since `b.append(lit[i])` modifies `b`, the new state of `b` will include the element `lit[i]` added to the end of the list. The conditions for `x` and `y` remain the same because the code does not affect `a`, `lit`, or the conditions for `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` was empty, `y` is now the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b` before the append operation, and `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
