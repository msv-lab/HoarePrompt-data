Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` when `x > y` or `lit[i] < x` and `x != y` when `x <= y`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` and `y >= lit[i]` when `x > y` or `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]` when `x <= y`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `lit[i] > x` and `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `b`; if `x >= lit[i] > y` and `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `x == y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` if `lit[i] > x` and to `b` if `lit[i] <= x`; if `x < y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]`.**
