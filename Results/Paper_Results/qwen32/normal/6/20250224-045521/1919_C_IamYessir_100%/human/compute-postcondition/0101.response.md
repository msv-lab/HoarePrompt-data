Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the last element of `a` except possibly `a[i]` which may be greater than `a[i - 1]`, `b` is a list of integers where each element is greater than the last element of `a` and less than or equal to the last element of `b`, `cp` remains 0, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`, `s` is 2 if `a[i] > a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` remains 1, `i` is \(k + 1\).**
