The code snippet `x = a[-1]` reassigns the value of `x` to be the last element of the list `a`. Since `x` was already defined as the last element of `a` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `x`. Therefore, no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.**
