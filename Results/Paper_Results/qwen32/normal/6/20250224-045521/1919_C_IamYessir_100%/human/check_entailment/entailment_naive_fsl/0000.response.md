Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always produce the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

The code attempts to split the array `lit` into two subsequences `a` and `b` and calculates the penalties for both subsequences. However, the logic for splitting the array does not guarantee that the penalty is minimized. The code seems to be making arbitrary choices about which subsequence to add the current element to, based on the last elements of `a` and `b`.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**

```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**

One optimal way to split the array is `s = [1, 2, 4]` and `t = [3]`. The penalty for `s` is 2 (since `1 < 2` and `2 < 4`), and the penalty for `t` is 0. Thus, the total penalty is 2.

**Actual Output from the Code:**

The code might produce a different result because it does not always make the optimal choice for splitting the array. For example, it might end up with subsequences that have a higher total penalty.

Let's see how the code processes the test case:

1. Initialize `a` and `b` as empty lists.
2. Process the first element `1`: Add it to `a` (since `a` is empty).
3. Process the second element `3`: Add it to `a` (since `a[-1] = 1` and `1 < 3`).
4. Process the third element `2`: Add it to `b` (since `a[-1] = 3` and `3 > 2`).
5. Process the fourth element `4`: Add it to `a` (since `a[-1] = 3` and `3 < 4`).

The subsequences end up being `a = [1, 3, 4]` and `b = [2]`. The penalty for `a` is 2 (since `1 < 3` and `3 < 4`), and the penalty for `b` is 0. Thus, the total penalty is 2, which is correct in this case. However, this is not guaranteed for all cases.

To ensure the code is correct, it must always produce the minimum possible penalty for any input. The current logic does not guarantee this. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

Since the code does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all possible inputs, the correctness is **False**.
