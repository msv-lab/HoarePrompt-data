The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before the append and `lit[i]` is not the last element of `a` after the append, or the last element of `a` after the append; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list; `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`; `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
