In the given task, the loop is controlled by the expression `int(input())`, which means the loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer input provided. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body.

Since the loop head only involves the loop variable `_` and the input function, the state of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, and `s` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by the input has not been reached.

Thus, the only thing that needs to be considered is the input for the next iteration. Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `lit`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element**.
