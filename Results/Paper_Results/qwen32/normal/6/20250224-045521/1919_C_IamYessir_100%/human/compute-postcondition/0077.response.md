The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will have one more element now. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and the condition for `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` was empty, `y` is now the element at index `i` of `lit`. If `b` was not empty, `y` is the last element of the list `b` before the append operation, and now `b` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**
