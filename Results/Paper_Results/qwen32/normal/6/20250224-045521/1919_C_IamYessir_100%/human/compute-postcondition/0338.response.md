The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state mentions that `a` is a list with at least 2 elements and `i` is `i + 1`, but neither `s` nor `i` are directly affected by the given code snippet except for `s`. Therefore, the value of `s` is incremented, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s + 1`**.
