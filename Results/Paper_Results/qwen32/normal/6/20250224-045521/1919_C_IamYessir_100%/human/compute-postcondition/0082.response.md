Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is updated based on the following conditions: if `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` is now `lit[i]`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation, and `b` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` becomes `lit[i]`, otherwise, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
