The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the current element of `lit` at index `i` to the list `b`. This changes the contents of `b` but does not affect the other variables directly unless `b` was previously empty and now contains one element.

Given the initial state and the operation performed:
- `b` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element.
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by appending an element to `b`.
- `s` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not perform any operations that would change the count of elements in `a` or `b` that are greater than their previous elements.
- `lit[i]` and `t`, `n`, and `cp` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with the additional element `lit[i]` appended; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` was empty and remains `float('inf')`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `y` is less than `lit[i]`; the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `x` is greater than `y`**.
