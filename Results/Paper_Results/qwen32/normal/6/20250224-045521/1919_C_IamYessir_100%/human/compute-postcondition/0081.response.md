Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains the same. If `lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `b` was empty, `y` becomes `lit[i]`, otherwise, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `b` based on the conditions provided in the if-else block.
