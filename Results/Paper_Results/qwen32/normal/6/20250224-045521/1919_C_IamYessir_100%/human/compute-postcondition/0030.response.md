The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. Since `a` is modified, its content changes, but the values of other variables remain the same unless they are directly dependent on `a`.

Given that `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, after appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `x` will now be equal to `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains unchanged because it is dependent on the list `b` and not on `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list with the new element `lit[i]` appended; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list.**
