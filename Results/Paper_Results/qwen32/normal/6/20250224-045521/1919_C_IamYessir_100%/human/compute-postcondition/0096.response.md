Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `lit`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the last element of `a` except for the current element `a[i]` which is greater than `a[i - 1]`; `b` is a list of integers where each element is greater than the last element of `a` and less than or equal to the last element of `b`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`; `s` is 0**
