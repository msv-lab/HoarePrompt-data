Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `x > y`, `y` is updated based on the conditions: if `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` is set to `lit[i]`; if `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation, and `b` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`; if `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`; if `y < lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` becomes `lit[i]`; otherwise, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`; if `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, if `x` was equal to `y`, `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity; if `x` was not equal to `y` and `x < y`, if `lit[i] >= y`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity; if `lit[i] > y` and `b` was empty, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`; if `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`; if `x` was not less than `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
