The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `lit[4]` is added to `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, or `y` directly, but it does change the list `b` by adding a new element to it. If `lit[4]` is greater than the current `y`, then `y` and `s` will be updated accordingly in subsequent operations, but this specific code snippet does not perform those checks or updates.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is a list that now includes `lit[4]` as its last element, and if `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. `i` is 4.**
