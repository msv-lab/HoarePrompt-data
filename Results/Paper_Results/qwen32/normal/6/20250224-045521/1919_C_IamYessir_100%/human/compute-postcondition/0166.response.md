The variable `x` is updated to `float('inf')`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')`; `y` is updated to the last element of `b` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` or `y >= lit[i] > x` respectively; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, `x` is now set to infinity, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
