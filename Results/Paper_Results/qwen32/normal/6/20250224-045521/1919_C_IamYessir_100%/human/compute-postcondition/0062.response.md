The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty, in which case `x` would be updated to the newly appended element.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `lit` remains the same list of integers.
- `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` appended to it.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty; otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `a`.
- `y` remains `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list; otherwise, `y` remains the last element of `b`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers; `a` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `lit[i]`; `b` is either empty or contains elements from `lit` where each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
