Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` (which remains undefined since `a` is empty); `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')` (which remains `float('inf')` since `b` is empty); `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated to the last element of `a` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y` or `lit[i] > y` respectively; `y` is updated to the last element of `b` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` or `y >= lit[i] > x` respectively; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element. If `x > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`; `b` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] <= x` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y`; `b` includes `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `y` remains unchanged or is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` was added to `b` or if `x > y` and `lit[i]` was not added to `a`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged. If `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` if `y >= lit[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 in this case. If `x <= y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty and `x == y`, or based on the conditions described in the else part, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` when `x > y` or `lit[i] < x` and `x != y` when `x <= y`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` and `y >= lit[i]` when `x > y` or `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]` when `x <= y`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `lit[i] > x` and `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `b`; if `x >= lit[i] > y` and `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `x == y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` if `lit[i] > x` and to `b` if `lit[i] <= x`; if `x < y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
