The code appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `a`. This means the list `a` now includes an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` remain based on their previous conditions.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` includes an additional element `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of the list `a` (which is now `lit[i]`), `y` is unchanged (positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise the last element of `b`).**
