The code snippet assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. This change affects only the variable `y`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is not an empty list; `cp` is 0; if `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b`.**
