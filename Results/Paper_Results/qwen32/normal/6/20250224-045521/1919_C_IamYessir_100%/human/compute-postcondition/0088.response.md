Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity or `lit[i]` if `b` was empty and `lit[i] > x`. If `lit[i] > y` and `b` was empty, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it if `lit[i] > y`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all possible conditions and their impacts on the variables `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`.
