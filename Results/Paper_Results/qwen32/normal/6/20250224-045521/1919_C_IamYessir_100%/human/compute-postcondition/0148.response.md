The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` in the list `lit` to the list `a`. This operation changes the list `a` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`, as it gains a new element. The value of `x` will also change if `a` was previously empty, because `x` is set to the last element of `a` after the append operation. If `a` was not empty, `x` will be updated to the new last element of `a`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list (it includes the new element `lit[i]`); `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`); `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.**
