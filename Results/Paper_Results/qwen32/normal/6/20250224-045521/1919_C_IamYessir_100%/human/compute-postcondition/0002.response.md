The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `lit`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
