Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list. If `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and not greater than `y`. If the condition `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is not met, `b` remains unchanged.**
