The code snippet provided appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This will change the value of `a` by adding `lit[i]` to it. The other variables, unless directly impacted by this operation, remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `a` is a list that may or may not be empty. After appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `a` will no longer be empty (if it was empty before) and will include the new element `lit[i]`. The value of `x` will be updated to the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`, and now includes `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
