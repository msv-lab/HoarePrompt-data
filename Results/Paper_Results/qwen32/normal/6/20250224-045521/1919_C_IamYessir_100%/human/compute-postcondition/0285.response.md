Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the value of `x` is being updated to the last element of the list `a`.

**Impact of the code on the program:**
- The value of `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (`a[-1]`).

**Variables affected:**
- `x` is updated to `a[-1]`.

**Other variables:**
- The other variables (`s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged unless they were affected by the conditions or operations not provided in the snippet.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`, `cp` is 0, `x` is `a[-1]`, `y` is a variable that is updated based on the conditions described, `i` is 4.**
