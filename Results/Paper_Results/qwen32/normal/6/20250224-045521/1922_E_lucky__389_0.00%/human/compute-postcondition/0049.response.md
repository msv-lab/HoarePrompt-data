The code snippet `x -= 2 ** i - 1` calculates `2 ** i - 1` and subtracts this value from `x`. Given that `i` is 4, the calculation becomes `2 ** 4 - 1`, which is `16 - 1`, resulting in `15`. Therefore, `x` will be reduced by `15`.

Given the initial state, `x` is at least 15, and since we are subtracting `15` from `x`, the new value of `x` will be at least `0`. The other variables `i` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is at least `0`; `i` is 4; `i` is not equal to 0; `subseq_lens` has 4 appended to it**.
