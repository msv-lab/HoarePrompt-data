Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 3 and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
