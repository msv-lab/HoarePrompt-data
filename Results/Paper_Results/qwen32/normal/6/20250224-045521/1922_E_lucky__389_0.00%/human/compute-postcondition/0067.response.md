Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is [3, 3, 4].
   - `mx` is 4.
   - `ansv` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].
   - `i` is 5.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(ansv[i], end=' ')`

3. **Determine the Value:**
   - The variable `ansv` is a list with the elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].
   - The variable `i` is 5.
   - Therefore, `ansv[i]` translates to `ansv[5]`, which is the element at index 5 in the list `ansv`.
   - The element at index 5 in `ansv` is 4.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `ansv[5]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **4 ** (where the trailing space is due to `end=' '` in the `print` statement)
