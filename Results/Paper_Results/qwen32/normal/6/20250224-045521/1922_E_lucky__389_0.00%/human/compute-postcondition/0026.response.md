To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop head is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that the next iteration's condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` is satisfied.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1.
2. For the loop to continue, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must hold true.

Since `i` has already been incremented, the condition we need to satisfy is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`, where `i` is the value after the increment.

To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- We need to make sure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` is true.

Let's denote the value of `i` after the increment as `i_new`. Therefore, the condition becomes `2 ** (i_new + 1) <= x + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `i` and `x`, we can express the state in terms of the relationship between `i_new` and `x`:

State: **`i` is increased by 1 and `x` must be such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time.
