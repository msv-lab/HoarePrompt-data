Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
