Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the program seems to be incorrect for generating the required array.

Here are a few issues with the provided program:
1. The logic for decomposing the number of subsequences `X` into a form that can be used to construct the array is flawed.
2. The array constructed does not guarantee that it will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
3. The program does not handle all edge cases or large values of `X` correctly.

For instance, the example outputs given in the problem statement do not match the output generated by the provided program. The program seems to be attempting to use a binary decomposition approach, which is not the correct method for solving this problem.

A correct approach would involve constructing the array in such a way that it generates the exact number of increasing subsequences required. This often involves using a combination of repeated elements and unique elements in a specific pattern to achieve the desired count of subsequences.
