The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of subsequence lengths, and then outputs the length of a derived list `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values explicitly; instead, it prints the results directly.
