Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is [3, 3, 4], `mx` is 4, `ansv` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4], `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ansv` is updated by appending the value of `subseq_lens[i]` to it. Since `i` is 2, `subseq_lens[2]` is 4, thus `ansv` becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. Other variables remain unchanged.
