Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i - 1
        mx = max(mx, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 3 and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer reduced by 2 if `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `i` is not 0, and `i` is 0 if the if condition is met, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by 2 and `mx` is updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is at least 15; `i` is 4 and `subseq_lens` has 4 appended to it; `mx` is at least 4. If `i` were 0, the most internal loop or if statement would be broken out of, but since `i` is 4, this does not occur.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
