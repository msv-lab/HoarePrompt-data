Postcondition: **x is at least 15; i is 4. The current value of i is 0.**

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the given if condition and the precondition. The if condition `if (i == 0):` suggests that `i` should be 0 to enter the if block, but the precondition states `i is 4`. Since these conditions cannot both be true simultaneously, the program will not enter the if statement under the given precondition. Therefore, the postcondition based on the provided if condition would not logically follow from the precondition. 

If we assume there might be an error in the precondition or the if condition, and we strictly follow the given if condition, the postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **x is at least 15; i is 0.** 

But this contradicts the initial precondition. Please verify the conditions provided.
