Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first element updated to `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is 0, and `sumo` is `int(a[0])`.**

In natural language: The value of `sumo` has been updated to be equal to the integer value of the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
