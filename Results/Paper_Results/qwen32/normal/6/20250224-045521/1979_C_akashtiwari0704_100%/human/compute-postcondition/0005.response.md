The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(l)`. Since `len(l)` is the length of the list `l` and does not change during the loop, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop iterates over the indices of the list `l`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 1**
