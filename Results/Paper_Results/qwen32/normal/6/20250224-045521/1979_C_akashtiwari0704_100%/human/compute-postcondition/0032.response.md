The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`, as it accumulates the string representation of the elements from the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.**

In simpler terms, the `ans` string now includes the string representation of the element `a[i]` followed by a space, while all other variables retain their previous values.
