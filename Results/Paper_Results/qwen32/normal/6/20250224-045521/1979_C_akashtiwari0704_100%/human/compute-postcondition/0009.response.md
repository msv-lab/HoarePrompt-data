To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variable `g`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and updates `g` using the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

This formula essentially computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list `l`. Here's how it works:
- Initially, `g` is set to 1.
- For each element `l[i]` in the list, `g` is updated to the LCM of the current `g` and `l[i]`.

After the loop completes all iterations, `g` will be the LCM of all the elements in the list `l`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize the final state as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `T` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `g` will be the LCM of all elements in the list `l` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `g` will be the least common multiple of all the numbers in the list `l`, and the other variables (`t` and `T`) will remain in their initial states.
