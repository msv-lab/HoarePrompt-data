Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is `'str(prod // a[0]) ' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[2]) + ' '`**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space. All other variables remain unchanged.
