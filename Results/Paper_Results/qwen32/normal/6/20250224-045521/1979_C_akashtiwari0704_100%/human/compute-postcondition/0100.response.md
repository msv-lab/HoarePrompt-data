The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `sumo` is updated to be the sum of its current value and `a[1]`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `T` is 2
- `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`
- `l` is a list with at least one element
- `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list where the first element is `prod // a[0]` and the second element is `prod // a[1]`
- `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`
- `i` is 1
- `sumo` is `int(a[0])`

After executing `sumo += int(a[i])`:
- `sumo` is updated to `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the first element is `prod // a[0]` and the second element is `prod // a[1]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`.**
