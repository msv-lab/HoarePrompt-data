Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, and `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
