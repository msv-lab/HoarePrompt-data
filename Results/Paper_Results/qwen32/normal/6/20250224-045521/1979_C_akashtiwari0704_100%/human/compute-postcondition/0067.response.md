The given code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the initial state to ensure we understand the context, even though it doesn't affect the output of this specific print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `T` is 1.
- `g` is the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of all elements in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `bets` is an input integer.
- `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`.
- `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the list `a` before the modification.
- `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`.
- `i` is 0.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

Since the `print(-1)` statement is independent of these variables, the output will simply be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
