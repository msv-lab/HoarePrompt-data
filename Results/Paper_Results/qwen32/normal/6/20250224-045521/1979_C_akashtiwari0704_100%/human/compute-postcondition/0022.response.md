The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to the variable `sumo`. The values of `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `i`, `bets`, and the condition for `a[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 0, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `sumo` + `int(a[i])`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sumo` has been updated to its previous value plus the integer value of `a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
