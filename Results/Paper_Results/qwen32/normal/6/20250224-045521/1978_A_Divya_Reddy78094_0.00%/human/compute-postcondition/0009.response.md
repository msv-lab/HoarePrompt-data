The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order. Therefore, the value of `nums` is updated to be in descending order, while the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
