The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` represents the number of test cases left to process. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since one iteration has just completed, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
