The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the next input. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
