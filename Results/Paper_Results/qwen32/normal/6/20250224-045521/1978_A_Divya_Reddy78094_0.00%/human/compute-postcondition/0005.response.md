To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- `n` is an integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Explanation:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means that the largest integer is at index 0, the second largest at index 1, and so on.
- The `print` statement calculates the sum of the first two elements of the `nums` list, which are the two largest integers in the list.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the sorted list `nums`)**
