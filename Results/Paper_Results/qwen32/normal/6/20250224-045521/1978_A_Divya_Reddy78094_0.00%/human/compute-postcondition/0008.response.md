The code snippet provided reads a new line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns this list of integers to the variable `nums`. This means the previous value of `nums` (which was a list of integers sorted in descending order) is replaced by the newly input list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers as provided by the new input.**
