The given code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 500. The code snippet does not affect the values of `n` or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case, as these are not mentioned in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case remain unchanged.**
