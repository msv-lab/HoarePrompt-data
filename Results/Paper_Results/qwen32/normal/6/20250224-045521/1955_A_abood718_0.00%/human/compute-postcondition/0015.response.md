Given the initial state, we know that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, which consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. However, the print statement only involves `A` and `B`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables**: 
   - `A` is the first integer from the input.
   - `B` is the second integer from the input.
   - `C` is the third integer from the input, but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **Operation**:
   - The print statement calculates the product of `A` and `B` and prints the result.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A * B`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the first and second integers from the input.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are the first and second integers from the input, respectively)**
