To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables `A`, `B`, and `C`**: These are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.
2. **Variable `i`**: This variable is incremented by 1. However, the value of `i` does not affect the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `A` is even, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`. However, `X` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it as well.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```
To determine the output, we need to evaluate the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.

- **Expression Breakdown**:
  - `A * C`: This is the product of the integers `A` and `C`.
  - `A * C / 2`: This is the result of dividing the product by 2. Since we are using `int()`, the result will be truncated to the nearest integer (i.e., floor division).

### Conditions Impact:
The conditions mentioned in the initial state do not affect the calculation of `A * C / 2` directly. They only change the value of `X` if `A` is odd, but `X` is not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, we can ignore these conditions for the purpose of determining the output.

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement will be the integer value of `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)** (where `A` and `C` are the integers obtained from the input)
