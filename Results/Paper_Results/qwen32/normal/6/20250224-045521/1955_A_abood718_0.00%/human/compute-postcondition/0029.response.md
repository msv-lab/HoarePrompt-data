Postcondition: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. `i` is incremented by 1. If `B * 2 < C`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the state remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

This postcondition captures the overall effect of the if-else block by summarizing the conditions and the resulting states of the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `i`, and `X` after the execution of the block.
