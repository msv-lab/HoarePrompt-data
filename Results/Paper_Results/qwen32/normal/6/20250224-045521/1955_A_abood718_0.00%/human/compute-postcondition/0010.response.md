Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Variable Definitions and Conditions:**
   - `A` is an odd integer.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer.
   - `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `X * C + B`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will result in an integer that is the floor division of `A` by 2. This means `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
   - `X * C` will be the product of `X` and `C`.
   - Finally, `X * C + B` will be the sum of the product `X * C` and the integer `B`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the value of `X * C + B`.
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Based on the above steps, the output can be described as:

Output: **X * C + B (where X is A // 2, A is an odd integer, B is an integer, C is an integer, and B * 2 is greater than or equal to C)**
