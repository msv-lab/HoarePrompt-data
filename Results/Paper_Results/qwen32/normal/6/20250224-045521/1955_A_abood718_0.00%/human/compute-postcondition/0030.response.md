Postcondition: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. `i` is incremented by 1. If `B * 2 < C`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` retain their initial values as integers from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition `B * 2 < C` is true, no further changes occur. If `B * 2 < C` is false and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.
