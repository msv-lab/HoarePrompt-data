Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input. The input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(X)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `X` is defined as `A // 2`, the value of `X` will be the integer part of `A` divided by 2.
- The exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, so we can't determine a specific numerical value for `X`.
- However, we know that `X` will be the integer division result of `A` by 2.

### Output:
The `print(X)` statement will print the integer division result of `A` by 2.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division result of A by 2)**
