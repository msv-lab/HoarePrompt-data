Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. The logic used in the function `func_1()` is flawed and does not follow the optimal strategy for both players.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Pile Sizes:**
   The code checks if the length of unique pile sizes is 1 or 2 and then makes a decision based on that. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) rather than just the count of unique pile sizes.

2. **Incorrect Use of Consecutive Differences:**
   The code calculates the number of consecutive differences of 1 and then uses this count to determine the winner. This is also incorrect because the game's outcome is not determined by the number of consecutive differences but by the Nim-sum.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Input:**
   The code converts the input pile sizes to a set, which removes duplicate values. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the actual pile sizes, not the unique pile sizes.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all piles have the same number of stones, the player who starts (Alice) should win by removing all stones in one move.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
- Calculate the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
- If the Nim-sum is 0, Bob wins because Alice cannot make a move that changes the Nim-sum to a non-zero value.
- If the Nim-sum is non-zero, Alice wins because she can always make a move that changes the Nim-sum to 0, forcing Bob into a losing position.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        nim_sum ^= num
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

This corrected code correctly determines the winner based on the Nim-sum, which is the optimal strategy for both players.
