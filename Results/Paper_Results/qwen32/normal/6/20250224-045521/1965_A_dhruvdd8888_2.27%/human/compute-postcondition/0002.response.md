The code snippet takes the set `nums`, converts its elements to integers, sorts them, and then reassigns the sorted list back to `nums`. The integer `N` representing the number of test cases is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line.**
