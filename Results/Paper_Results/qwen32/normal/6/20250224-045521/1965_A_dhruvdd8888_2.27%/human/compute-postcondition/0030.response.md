Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any direct input parameters. It reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. The function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console for each test case, indicating the winner. The function does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`).**
