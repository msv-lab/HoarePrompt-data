The function receives no direct input arguments. Instead, it reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) representing the number of piles, and the next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
