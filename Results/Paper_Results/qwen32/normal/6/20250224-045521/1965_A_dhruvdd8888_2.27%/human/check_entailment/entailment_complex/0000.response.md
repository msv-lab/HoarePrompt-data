### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the number of unique pile sizes and their consecutive differences. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect for determining the winner.

Here are several issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: 
   - The line `nums = set(input().split())` converts the input to a set, which removes duplicate values. This is incorrect because the game depends on the exact count of each pile size, not just unique pile sizes.
   - The line `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` then sorts the unique pile sizes, which is not enough to determine the winner correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Consecutive Differences**:
   - The program checks if there are consecutive numbers in the sorted unique pile sizes and counts how many consecutive numbers there are. This is not a valid strategy for determining the winner of the game.
   - The game's outcome depends on the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes when played optimally. The program does not calculate this.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The outer loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` correctly iterates over multiple test cases, but the logic inside `func_1()` is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, we need to calculate the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins (since Alice cannot make a move that leaves a non-zero Nim-sum for Bob). Otherwise, Alice wins.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
