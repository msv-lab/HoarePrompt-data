The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components (presumably numbers or strings), and then converts these components into a set called `nums`. This means that `nums` will contain unique elements from the input.

Given the initial state, `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the state regarding the test cases and their respective piles of stones remains unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the `nums` set, which is populated with the unique elements from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is read from the standard input; `nums` is a set containing unique elements from the input line.**
