Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the conditions.

The conditions and logic used in the program match the problem description exactly. The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range and outputs the correct result for each case.

Correctness: **True**
