The code snippet `q = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range 0 to 9. The variable `q` is newly introduced and assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is an input integer.**
