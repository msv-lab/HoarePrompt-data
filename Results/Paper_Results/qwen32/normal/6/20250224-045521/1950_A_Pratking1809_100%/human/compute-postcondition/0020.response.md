The code snippet provided reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t`, `q`, and `i` remains unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `q` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain as they were initially. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, each within the range of 0 to 9.
