Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- It is explicitly stated that it is **not** the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- The current relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect the output of this specific print statement. The string `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **PEAK**
