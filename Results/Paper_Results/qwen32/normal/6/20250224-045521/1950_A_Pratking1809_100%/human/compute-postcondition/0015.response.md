The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Based on the precondition, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their relationships.

Output: **PEAK**
