Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
- `q` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('PEAK')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` do not affect what is printed by this statement because they are not used within the `print` function. The string `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **PEAK**
