The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, with `q` being greater than 0. However, the variable `q` is not affected by the code snippet provided, and `t` is not used in the code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `q` must be greater than 0.**
