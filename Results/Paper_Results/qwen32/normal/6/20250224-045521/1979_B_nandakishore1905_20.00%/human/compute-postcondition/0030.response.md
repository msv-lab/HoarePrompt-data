Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is set to 2 if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, or 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` otherwise. `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `i` is incremented by 1.**
