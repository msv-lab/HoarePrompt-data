Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is an integer and `m` is odd.
- `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, which simplifies to `|0 - m|` or `|-m|`, so `k` is `|m|`, which is `m` since `m` is odd.
- `k` is not a power of 2.

The print statement is:
```
print(1)
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
