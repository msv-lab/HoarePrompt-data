Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000 (inclusive).
- `n` and `m` are integers that are obtained from the input.
- `k` is defined as the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m` (`k = abs(n - m)`).
- Additionally, it is given that `k` is a power of 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`**: 
   - `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (`k = abs(n - m)`).
   - The problem specifies that `k` is a power of 2. Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.

2. **Output**:
   - The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.
   - Since `k` is explicitly defined to be a power of 2, the output will be one of the values that are powers of 2.

### Conclusion:
The value of `k` is a power of 2, but without specific values for `n` and `m`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know it will be one of the powers of 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
