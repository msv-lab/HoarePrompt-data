The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the number `2`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
3. The variable `k` is the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
4. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its value is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only contains the integer `2`, the output will be the number `2` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `i`.

Output: **2**
