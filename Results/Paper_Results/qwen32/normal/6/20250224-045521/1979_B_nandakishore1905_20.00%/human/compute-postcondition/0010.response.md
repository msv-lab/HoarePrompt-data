Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is an even integer.
- `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, which simplifies to `|0 - m| = |m|`.
- `k` is not a power of 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`. The value of `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
