The code snippet updates the value of `k` to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged unless further operations are performed based on the new value of `k`. Since the code only updates `k` and does not affect `n`, `m`, or `i` directly, we consider only the change in `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
