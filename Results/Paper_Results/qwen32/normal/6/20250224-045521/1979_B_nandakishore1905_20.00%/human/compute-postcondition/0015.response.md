To determine the output of the `print(k - q)` statement, we need to understand the values of `k` and `q` based on the given initial state.

1. **`k` is the absolute value of `n - m`**:
   - `k` is calculated as `abs(n - m)`. The exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, but we know that `k` is not a power of 2.

2. **`l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string**:
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k`. For example, if `k` is 5, then `l` would be `'101'`.

3. **`p` is the length of `l`**:
   - `p` is the number of characters in the binary string `l`. Continuing the example, if `l` is `'101'`, then `p` would be 3.

4. **`q` is `2`**:
   - `q` is explicitly given as 2.

Now, we need to calculate `k - q`:
- Since `q` is 2, we need to subtract 2 from `k`.

Given that `k` is the absolute value of `n - m` and is not a power of 2, the exact numerical value of `k` is not provided. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

The `print(k - q)` statement will output the result of `k - 2`.

Output: **k - 2 (where k is the absolute value of n - m, and k is not a power of 2)**
