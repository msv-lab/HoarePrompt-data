You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) where:
- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)

The sequences are defined based on the bitwise XOR operation between the index \(n\) and the given integers \(x\) and \(y\).

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). The goal is to determine the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\).

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculating `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Checking if `k` is a Power of Two:**
   - The condition `k & k - 1 == 0` checks if `k` is a power of two. If true, it prints `k`.
     - This is correct because if `k` is a power of two, then the longest common subsegment length is `k`.

4. **Special Cases for `n == 0`:**
   - If `n == 0` and `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
     - This is incorrect. When `n == 0`, the sequence \(a_n\) starts with \(0 \oplus x = x\), and the sequence \(b_n\) starts with \(0 \oplus y = y\). If `m` is odd, the longest common subsegment length is not necessarily `1`.
   - If `n == 0` and `m` is even, it prints `2`.
     - This is also incorrect for the same reason as above.

5. **General Case:**
   - For other cases, it calculates the binary representation of `k`, finds the length of this binary representation (`p`), calculates `q` as \(2^{(p-1)}\), and prints `k - q`.
     - This logic seems to be trying to find the largest power of two less than `k` and subtracting it from `k`. However, this is not a correct approach for finding the longest common subsegment length.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the length of the longest common subsegment for all cases. The special cases for `n == 0` are incorrect, and the general case logic does not align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
