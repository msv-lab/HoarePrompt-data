Precondition: **Each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y. The function will be called with multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y as described.**
