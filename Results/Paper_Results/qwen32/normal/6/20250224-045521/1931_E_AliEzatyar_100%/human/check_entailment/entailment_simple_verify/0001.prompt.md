You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers. The game ends when there is only one integer left in the list. The winner is determined based on the value of this final integer:

- If the final integer is not less than \(10^m\), Sasha wins.
- Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Player Moves

- **Anna's Move:** Choose an element and reverse its digits (leading zeros are removed).
- **Sasha's Move:** Choose two elements, concatenate them in any order, and replace the two elements with the concatenated result.

### Strategy

The program seems to be trying to determine the winner based on the number of trailing zeros in the numbers. However, the logic is not directly clear from the provided code. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Trailing Zeros:** The function `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number. This is used to determine the potential impact of Anna's moves on the total number of digits.
2. **Total Digits:** The program calculates the total number of digits in the list of numbers.
3. **Subtracting Zeros:** The program subtracts the number of trailing zeros (considering every second zero due to the alternating turns) from the total number of digits.
4. **Comparison:** The program compares the adjusted total number of digits with \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

### Key Issues

1. **Reversing Digits:** The program does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers. It only counts trailing zeros, which does not fully capture the effect of Anna's moves.
2. **Concatenation Strategy:** The program does not simulate Sasha's moves of concatenating numbers. It assumes a strategy based on the number of trailing zeros, which may not be optimal or representative of the actual game dynamics.
3. **Winning Condition:** The program checks if the adjusted total number of digits is at least \(m + 1\). However, this condition does not fully account for the possibility of Sasha winning through strategic concatenation.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics or fully capture the optimal strategies for both players. It relies on an oversimplified model based on trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the winner based on the described game rules and optimal strategies for both players.
