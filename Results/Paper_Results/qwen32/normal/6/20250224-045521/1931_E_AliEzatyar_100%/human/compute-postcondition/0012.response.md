The code snippet `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The initial state specifies that `counter` is set to either 1 or 2 if the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, otherwise `counter` remains 0. Since `counter` is being incremented, if it was 1, it will become 2, and if it was 2, it will become 3. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is decremented by 1.**
