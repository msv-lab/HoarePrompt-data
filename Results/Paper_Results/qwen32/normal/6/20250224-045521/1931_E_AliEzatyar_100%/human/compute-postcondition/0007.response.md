The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from the last index of the list `num` to the first index (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to access an element in the list `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, provided that it is still within the bounds of the list.

Given that the loop iterates in reverse order, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, as long as `i` is not less than 0.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element. If the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0. `i` is the index that was used in the previous iteration minus 1**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can only say that it should be decremented by 1. Therefore, the state should reflect that `i` is now one less than its previous value, but it must still be a valid index in the list.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element. If the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0. `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
