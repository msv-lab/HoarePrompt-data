The code snippet removes the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. Therefore, the deque `nums` will have two fewer elements after this operation. The values of `a` and `b` will be the first and last elements of `nums` before the operation, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the first element of the original `nums`; `b` is the last element of the original `nums`; `ans` is 0**.
