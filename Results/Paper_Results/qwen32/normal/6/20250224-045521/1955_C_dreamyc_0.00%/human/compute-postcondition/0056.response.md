Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest possible pairs of elements until a threshold `k` is exhausted or no more pairs can be removed. It returns the count of elements that were fully processed and removed. If there is one element left and `k` is still sufficient to remove it, it includes this element in the count.**
