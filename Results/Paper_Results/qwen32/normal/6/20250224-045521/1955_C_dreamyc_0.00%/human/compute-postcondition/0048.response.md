Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element of the original `nums`. `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element of the original `nums`. If `a > 0`, `nums` has at least 1 element with `a` as the first element and is missing its last element from the original state. If `a <= 0`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, and `ans` is incremented by 1. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b` in the original state. If `k < 2 * x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `ans` has been incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
