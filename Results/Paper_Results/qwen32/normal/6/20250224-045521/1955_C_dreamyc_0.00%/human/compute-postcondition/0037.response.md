The code snippet removes the first element from the deque `nums` and assigns it to `a`, and removes the last element from the deque `nums` and assigns it to `b`. This means `nums` will have two fewer elements after the operation.

Given that `len(nums)` was at least 2 initially, after this operation, `len(nums)` will still be at least 0, but more specifically, it will be at least 0 and potentially greater, depending on the initial length of `nums`.

The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state.**
