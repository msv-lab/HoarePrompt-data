Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, which is an integer representing a threshold value; and `nums`, which is a list of `n` integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` and counts how many elements are fully processed and removed. In Case_1, if a certain condition is met, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of fully processed and removed elements. In Case_2, the function returns `ans`, the count of fully processed and removed elements.**
