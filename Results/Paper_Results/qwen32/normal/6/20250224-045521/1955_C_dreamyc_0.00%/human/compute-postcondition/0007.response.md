The code snippet `b -= x` modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `x` from it. Given the initial state, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, after the operation, `b` will be reduced by the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus `x`; `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus `x`; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` before the operation; `ans` is 0.**
