Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of the original `nums`, respectively; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. `a` is not greater than 0. `ans` is 0.**
