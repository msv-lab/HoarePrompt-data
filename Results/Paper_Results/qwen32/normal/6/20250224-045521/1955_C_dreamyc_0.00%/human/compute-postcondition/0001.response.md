The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0.**
