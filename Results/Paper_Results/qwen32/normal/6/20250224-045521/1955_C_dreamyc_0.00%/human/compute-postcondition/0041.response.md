The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * x`. The values of `a`, `b`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`, and `k` is initially greater than 0, we need to reflect the change in `k` while keeping other variables as they are.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0 minus 2 * x, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**
