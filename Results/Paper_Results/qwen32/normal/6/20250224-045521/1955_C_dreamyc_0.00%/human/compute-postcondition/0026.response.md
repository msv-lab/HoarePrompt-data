The value of `b` is decremented by `x`. Since `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, the new value of `b` will be `b - x`. The values of `k`, `a`, and `len(nums)` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `len(nums)` is at least 1, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
