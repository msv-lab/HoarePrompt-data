Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `2^x - 1` if `k = 2` or `s` is `(1 + (k - 2) * (2^x - 1))` if `k > 2`**

Explanation: The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the values provided by the input. The value of `s` is still defined by the same conditional expression based on the new values of `k` and `x`.
