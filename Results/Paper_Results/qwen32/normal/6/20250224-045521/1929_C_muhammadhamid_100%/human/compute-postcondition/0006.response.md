To determine the Output State, let's break down the given code snippet and compute the changes:

Initial State: 
- `k` is an integer
- `x` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is an integer
- `s` is `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`
- `i` is incremented by 1

The code snippet provided is:
```python
s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

First, compute the initial value of `s`:
- `s = 2 + 1 // (k - 1)`

The expression `1 // (k - 1)` will yield `0` if `k > 1` because integer division of `1` by any integer greater than `1` results in `0`. If `k = 1`, then there would be a division by zero error, but since `k` is an integer and there's no specific condition that `k` can be `1`, we assume `k > 1` for the sake of this calculation. Therefore:
- `s = 2 + 0 = 2`

Now, apply the code snippet:
- `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`

Since `s` is `2` and `k > 1`:
- `s // (k - 1)` will be `2 // (k - 1)`, which is `0` because `2` divided by any integer greater than `1` will result in `0` due to integer division.
- Therefore, `s += 0 + 1`
- `s = 2 + 1 = 3`

The other variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1.**
