The code modifies the value of `s` based on the current values of `k` and `s`. The expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` is added to the current value of `s`. Given that `s` is initially 1, the new value of `s` will be `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `x` and `a` are not modified by the code, they retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`**.
