Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.**

In simpler terms: The variable `v` has been created as a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
