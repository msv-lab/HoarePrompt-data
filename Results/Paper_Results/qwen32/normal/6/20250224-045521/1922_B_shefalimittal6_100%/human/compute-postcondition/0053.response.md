Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representing a positive integer, `idx` is `n + 4`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is `0`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 2` and `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 3`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `data[n + 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`**

In simple terms, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it `n + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
