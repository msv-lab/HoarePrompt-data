The code snippet `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is `0`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to `3`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The value of `cnt` is now `cnt + v[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
