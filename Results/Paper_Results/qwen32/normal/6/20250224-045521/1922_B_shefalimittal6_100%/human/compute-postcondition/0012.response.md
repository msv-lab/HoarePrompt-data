Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
