The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least n + 3 elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is 3n + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` three times, `v` is a list of n + 1 zeros with `v[x]` incremented according to the values in `data` from index 2n + 4 to 3n + 3, `cnt` is the sum of all `v[i]` from `i = 0` to `i = n`, `ans` is the sum of contributions from each `v[i]` that meets the conditions inside the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is n.**
