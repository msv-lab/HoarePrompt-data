The code snippet `x = s.count('map')` counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, while `x` is assigned the count of 'map' in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`.**
