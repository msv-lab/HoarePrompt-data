Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and subtracts the occurrences of the overlapping substring "mapie". However, this approach is incorrect for determining the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The logic in the program assumes that each occurrence of "map" and "pie" can be removed independently and that overlapping occurrences of "mapie" should be counted only once. However, this does not correctly account for the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all instances of "map" and "pie" from the string.

For example, consider a string like "mapiepie". The program would count 1 "map", 2 "pie", and 1 "mapie", resulting in `1 + 2 - 1 = 2`. However, the correct answer is 2, but the program's logic does not guarantee the minimum deletions in all cases, especially when substrings overlap in more complex ways.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated string processing method is needed to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated accurately.

Correctness: **False**
