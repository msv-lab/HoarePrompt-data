Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 52, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is greater than 27, `word` is the string 'a' + the (n - 28)-th letter of the alphabet + 'z'. Otherwise, `word` is the string 'aa' + the (n - 2)-th letter of the alphabet.**
