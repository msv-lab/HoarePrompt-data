The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The value of `n` is read from the input and will be an integer between 3 and 78 for each test case. Since the input value for `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that it will be updated to the value provided by the user, which must be within the range of 3 to 78.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
