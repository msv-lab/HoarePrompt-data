Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, and `word` is set as follows: if `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` equals 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the character at the index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.**
