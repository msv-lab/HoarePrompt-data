Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, and `word` is set based on the value of `n`. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is `'aay'`. If 28 <= `n` <= 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` < 27, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.**
