### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that sums up to a given integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The program follows these steps:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**: It uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map each letter to its respective position in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, ..., z = 26).

2. **Iterate Through Test Cases**: The program reads `t` test cases and for each test case, it processes the integer `n`.

3. **Constructing the Word**:
   - If `n > 52`, the program constructs a word of the form `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This means the first letter is determined by `n - 53`, and the remaining two letters are 'z'. This is because `53` is the sum of the smallest possible first letter ('a' = 1) and the two largest letters ('z' = 26) twice.
   - If `27 < n <= 52`, the program constructs a word of the form `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. Here, the first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, and the third letter is 'z'. This is because `28` is the sum of the smallest possible first letter ('a' = 1) and the largest letter ('z' = 26).
   - If `n == 27`, the program constructs the word `'aay'`. This is a special case because `a + a + y = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27`.
   - If `n < 27`, the program constructs a word of the form `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. Here, the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`. This is because `3` is the sum of the smallest possible first two letters ('a' = 1) twice.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

- For `n = 24`:
  - Since `24 < 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3] = 'aa' + alphabet[21] = 'aav'`.
  
- For `n = 70`:
  - Since `70 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[17] + 'zz' = 'rzz'`.
  
- For `n = 3`:
  - Since `n < 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3] = 'aa' + alphabet[0] = 'aaa'`.
  
- For `n = 55`:
  - Since `27 < 55 <= 52`, the word is `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[27] + 'z' = 'czz'`.
  
- For `n = 48`:
  - Since `27 < 48 <= 52`, the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z' = 'auz'`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the given examples.
