The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the user input. The variables `t`, `i`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1.**
