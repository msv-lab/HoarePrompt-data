Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, and `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` if `n > 27`. If `n` is 27, `word` is set to `'aay'`. Otherwise, if `n` is less than 27, `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.**
