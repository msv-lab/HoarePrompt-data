Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description.

The program is supposed to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`. The integer `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Alphabet Indexing**: The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map letters to their positions in the alphabet (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).

2. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - **Case n > 52**: The program constructs the word by taking the letter at position `n - 53` in the alphabet (since the smallest possible sum of three letters is 3 (aaa) and the largest possible sum is 78 (zzz)), followed by 'zz'. This is incorrect because it doesn't ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
   - **Case n > 27**: The program constructs the word by using 'a', followed by the letter at position `n - 28`, and then 'z'. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - **Case n == 27**: The program constructs the word as 'aay', which is only correct for this specific case.
   - **Case n <= 27**: The program constructs the word by using 'aa' followed by the letter at position `n - 3`. This is incorrect as well.

The logic in the program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest word for any given `n`. The program does not consider all possible combinations of three letters and their sums to find the smallest lexicographical word that matches the given sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible combinations of three letters and find the one with the smallest lexicographical order that sums to `n`.

**Conclusion**: The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
