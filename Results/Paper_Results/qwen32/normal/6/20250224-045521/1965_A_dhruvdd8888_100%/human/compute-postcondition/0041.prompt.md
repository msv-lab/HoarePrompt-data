You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums.add('0')
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    ls = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] -= ls
        
        ls += nums[i]
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same.
    #- `N` remains the same.
    #- `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements.
    #- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.
    #- `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` (the last index of `nums`).
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #Output State:
    nw = True
    cw = True
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            cw = not nw
        else:
            cw = True
        
        nw = cw
        
    #State: t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N, ls, i is 1, nums remains the same, nw is True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False, cw is True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False.
    if cw :
        print('Alice')
        #This is printed: Alice
    else :
        print('Bob')
        #This is printed: Bob
    #State: t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N, ls, i are unchanged, nums remains the same, nw is True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False, and cw reflects whether nums[1] is not 1 (True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of integers in the list, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
