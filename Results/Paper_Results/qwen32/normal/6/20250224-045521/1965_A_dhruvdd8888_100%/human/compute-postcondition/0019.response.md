The code snippet `cw = not nw` flips the value of `cw` based on the value of `nw`. Given that `nw` is `True`, `cw` will be set to `False`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` is `len(nums) - 2`; `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `False`; `len(nums)` must be at least 3; the current value of `nums[i]` is 1.**
