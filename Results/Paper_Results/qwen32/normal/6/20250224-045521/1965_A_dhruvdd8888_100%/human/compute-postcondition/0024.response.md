The only variables in the loop head are `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts from `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). 

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration remains the same except for `i`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, the loop would terminate. Therefore, `i` must have been greater than 1 in the previous iteration.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is `False`; otherwise, `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `cw`.

Since `i` was used in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.
