The code snippet provided is `cw = not nw`. This means that the value of `cw` will be the opposite of the current value of `nw`.

Initial State: `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, `nw` is equal to `cw`

After executing `cw = not nw`, the value of `cw` becomes the opposite of `nw`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is the opposite of `nw`, `nw` is equal to the original `cw`**.
