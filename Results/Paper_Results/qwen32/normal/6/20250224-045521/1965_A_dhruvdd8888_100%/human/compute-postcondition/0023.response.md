The code snippet assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Therefore, the value of `nw` will be `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, and `True` otherwise.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is `False`; otherwise, `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `cw`.**
