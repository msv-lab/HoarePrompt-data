To determine the state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the effect of each iteration of the loop on the variables `nums` and `ls`.

Here's the loop code again for reference:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    nums[i] -= ls
    ls += nums[i]
```

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **First Iteration (i=0)**:
   - `nums[0] -= ls` → `nums[0] -= 0` → `nums[0]` remains the same.
   - `ls += nums[0]` → `ls = nums[0]`.

2. **Second Iteration (i=1)**:
   - `nums[1] -= ls` → `nums[1] -= nums[0]`.
   - `ls += nums[1]` → `ls = nums[0] + (nums[1] - nums[0]) = nums[1]`.

3. **Third Iteration (i=2)**:
   - `nums[2] -= ls` → `nums[2] -= nums[1]`.
   - `ls += nums[2]` → `ls = nums[1] + (nums[2] - nums[1]) = nums[2]`.

### Generalizing the Iterations:
For each iteration `i`:
- `nums[i] -= ls` → `nums[i] -= (sum of all previous nums[j] for j < i)`.
- `ls += nums[i]` → `ls = (sum of all nums[j] for j <= i)`.

### Final State:
By the end of all iterations, each element `nums[i]` will be reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list. The final value of `ls` will be the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same.
- `N` remains the same.
- `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.
- `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` (the last index of `nums`).

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a transformed sorted list of unique integers where each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, each element in `nums` is adjusted by subtracting the sum of all previous elements, and `ls` holds the total sum of the original `nums` list.
