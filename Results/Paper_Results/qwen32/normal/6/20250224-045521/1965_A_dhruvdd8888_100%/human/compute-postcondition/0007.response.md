The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` increments the variable `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `ls` is initially 0 and `i` is 0. Therefore, `ls` will be updated to the value of `nums[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`; `ls` is `nums[0]`; `i` is 0**.
