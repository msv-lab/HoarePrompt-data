To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states after the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates from `i = len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (inclusive). The loop modifies `cw` and `nw` based on the value of `nums[i]`:
- If `nums[i] == 1`, `cw` is set to the opposite of `nw`.
- Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True`.
- `nw` is then set to the value of `cw`.

### Initial State
- `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, and `nums` remain unchanged except for `nums` which is transformed.
- `i` starts at `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 in each iteration.
- `nw` and `cw` are initialized to `True`.

### Iteration Analysis
Let's summarize the changes in `cw` and `nw` based on the provided states:

1. **After 1 iteration** (`i = len(nums) - 2`):
   - If `nums[len(nums) - 2] == 1`, `cw` becomes `False` and `nw` becomes `False`.
   - Otherwise, `cw` and `nw` both become `True`.

2. **After 2 iterations** (`i = len(nums) - 3`):
   - If `nums[len(nums) - 3] == 1`, `cw` becomes the opposite of the initial `nw` (which was `True`), so `cw` becomes `False` and `nw` becomes `False`.
   - Otherwise, `cw` and `nw` both become `True`.

3. **After 3 iterations** (`i = len(nums) - 4`):
   - If `nums[len(nums) - 4] == 1`, `cw` becomes the opposite of the previous `nw` (which was `False` if the previous `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `True`), so `cw` becomes `True` if the previous `nw` was `False`, and `nw` becomes `True`.
   - Otherwise, `cw` and `nw` both become `True`.

### Final State
The loop runs from `i = len(nums) - 2` down to `1`. By the end of the loop:
- `i` will be `1`.
- The values of `cw` and `nw` will depend on the sequence of `nums[i]` values, but the final state of `nw` and `cw` can be deduced by the pattern observed.

Given that `nw` and `cw` are set based on the last `nums[i]` value encountered, the final state of `nw` and `cw` will be:
- `cw` will be `True` if the last `nums[i]` (i.e., `nums[1]`) is not `1`.
- `nw` will be `True` if the last `nums[i]` (i.e., `nums[1]`) is not `1`.

If `nums[1] == 1`, then `cw` will be `False` and `nw` will be `False`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations are complete, the final state of the loop variables is:
- `i` will be `1`.
- `cw` and `nw` will be `True` if `nums[1]` is not `1`; otherwise, they will be `False`.

Output State: **t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N, ls, i is 1, nums remains the same, nw is True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False, cw is True if nums[1] is not 1, otherwise False.**
