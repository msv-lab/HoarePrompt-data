Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` is not empty** 

However, there seems to be a small discrepancy in the negation of the if condition. The if condition checks if `new_segment` is truthy, which for a list means it is not empty. The negation of this condition means `new_segment` should be empty. Therefore, the correct postcondition should be:

Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` remains an empty list**
