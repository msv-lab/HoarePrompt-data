Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `segments_variants` has a new element added which is `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it.**

In simple terms: The list `segments_variants` now includes a new element, which is the list `new_segment` with the value `i - 1` added to it. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` was initially `i + 1` before the code was executed.
