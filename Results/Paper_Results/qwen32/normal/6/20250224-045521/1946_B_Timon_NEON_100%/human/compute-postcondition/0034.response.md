Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` (the truth value of this condition is unknown as `new_segment` is now empty), `segments_variants` has not been modified, and `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are increased by `arr[i]`.**
