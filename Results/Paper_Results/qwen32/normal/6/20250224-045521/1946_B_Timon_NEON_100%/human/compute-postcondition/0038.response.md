Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` (the truth value of this condition is unknown as `new_segment` is now empty), and `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment` is either a list containing `arr[i]` and `i` (if `arr[i]` is non-negative) or undefined (if `arr[i]` is negative), and `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. `segments_variants` has not been modified.**
