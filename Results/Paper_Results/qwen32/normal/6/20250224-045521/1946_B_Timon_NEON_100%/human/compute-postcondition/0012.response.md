Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, `i - 1`]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated to contain `new_segment + [i - 1]`. The current element `arr[i]` is less than 0 and remains unchanged.**
