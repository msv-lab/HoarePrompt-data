Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`. Otherwise, if `max_segment[0]` (updated) is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new element added which is `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. `new_segment` is an empty list after the else part. `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**
