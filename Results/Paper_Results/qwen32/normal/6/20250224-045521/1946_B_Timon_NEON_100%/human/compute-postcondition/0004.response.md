The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(arr)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have a length of at least 1. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because the `range(len(arr))` will automatically start `i` at 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
