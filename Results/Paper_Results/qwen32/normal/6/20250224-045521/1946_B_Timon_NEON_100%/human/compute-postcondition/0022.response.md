Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1. If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list.**
