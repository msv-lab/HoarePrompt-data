### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `number` and returns `number % 1000000007`. This is consistent with the problem requirement to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous non-negative subarray and return it along with the starting index.
   - It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum of non-negative segments (`new_segment` and `max_segment`).
   - When a negative number is encountered, it checks if the current segment is better than the previously recorded maximum segment and updates accordingly.
   - After the loop, it appends the last segment to `segments_variants` and finds the maximum segment from all segments.
   - This logic seems correct for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous non-negative subarray.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum of a contiguous non-negative subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is negative, it sets it to 0 (since inserting a negative sum would not increase the total sum).
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The formula is based on the idea that the best strategy is to repeatedly insert the maximum non-negative subarray sum, which doubles the contribution of that subarray in each insertion.
   - Finally, it prints the result by calling `func_1(answer)` to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is defined but not used in the main execution. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete function, as it does not perform any operations and always returns 0.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the solution to the problem based on the provided logic and the main execution flow. The only unused function `func_3` does not affect the correctness of the program.

**Correctness: True**
