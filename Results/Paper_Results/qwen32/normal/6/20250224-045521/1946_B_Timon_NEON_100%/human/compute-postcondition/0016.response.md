Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` where the first element is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the first element of `max_segment` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the current element `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
