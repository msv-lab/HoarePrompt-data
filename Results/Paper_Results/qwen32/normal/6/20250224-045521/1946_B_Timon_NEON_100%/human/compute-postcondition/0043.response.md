Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new element added which is `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
