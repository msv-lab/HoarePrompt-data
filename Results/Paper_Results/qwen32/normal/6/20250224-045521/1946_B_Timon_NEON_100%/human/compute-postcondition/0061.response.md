The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more segments in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` was [[7, 2, 4]], and the loop processed the segment [7, 2, 4].

To execute one more time, there must be another segment in `segments_variants`. Since we've already processed [7, 2, 4], we need to assume there is at least one more segment in the list for the loop to continue.

State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 4, -1], `new_segment` is [7, 2], `max_segment` is [7, 2], `segments_variants` is [[7, 2, 4], [another_segment]], `max_sum` is -1**.

Here, `[another_segment]` represents the next segment in the list that the loop will process. Since the exact values of `another_segment` are not specified, we leave it as a placeholder to indicate that there is another segment to process.
