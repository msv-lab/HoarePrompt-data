The code modifies `max_segment[0]` by adding the current element `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` will decrease. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is decreased by the absolute value of `arr[i]`, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, `i - 1`]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated to contain `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**
