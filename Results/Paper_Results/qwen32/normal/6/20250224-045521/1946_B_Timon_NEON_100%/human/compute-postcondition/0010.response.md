The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is formed by extending the `new_segment` list with the value `i - 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `new_segment` is not an empty list.
- `max_segment` is [0, 0].
- `segments_variants` is an empty list.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- The current element `arr[i]` is less than 0.
- `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.

After executing the code, `segments_variants` will no longer be an empty list but will contain the new segment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1.**
