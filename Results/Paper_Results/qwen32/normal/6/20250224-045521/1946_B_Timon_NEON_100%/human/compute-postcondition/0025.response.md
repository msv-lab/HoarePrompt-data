The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- The state of `new_segment`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` depends on the value of `arr[i]` in the previous iteration, but they are not directly related to the loop head.

To proceed to the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the next element to be processed**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the next state as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. Assuming `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the next state would be `i` is `x + 1`. However, without the exact value of `x`, we generalize it as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1**.
