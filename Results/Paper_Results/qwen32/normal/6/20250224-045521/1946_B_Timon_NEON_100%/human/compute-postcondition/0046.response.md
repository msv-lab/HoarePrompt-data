The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the value of the first element of the list `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` refers to the next index in the `arr` list compared to its previous value.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the first element of `max_segment` has been increased by the value of the element in `arr` at the index `i`. The values of `arr` and `i` remain the same, except `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this operation.
