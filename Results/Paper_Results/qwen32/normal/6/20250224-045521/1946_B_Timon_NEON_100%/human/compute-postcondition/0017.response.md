The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` modifies the first element of `new_segment` by adding the current element `arr[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `arr[i]` is a non-negative integer, so the first element of `new_segment` will increase by this non-negative value.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list where the first element is now `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` where the first element is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language: The first element of `new_segment` has been increased by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
