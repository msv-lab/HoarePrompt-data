Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If `new_segment` is not empty, then: 
- If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is decreased by the absolute value of `arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is updated to [[0, 0, `i - 1`]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated to contain `new_segment + [i - 1]`. 
- If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.
If `new_segment` is empty, then:
- `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1. If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` (the truth value of this condition is unknown as `new_segment` is now empty), and `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment` is either a list containing `arr[i]` and `i` (if `arr[i]` is non-negative) or undefined (if `arr[i]` is negative), and `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. `segments_variants` has not been modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `new_segment` is true, `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < 0`, `new_segment[0]` is also updated by adding `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it if `max_segment[0]` (updated) is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` includes `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. `new_segment` is an empty list after the else part. If `new_segment` is false, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
