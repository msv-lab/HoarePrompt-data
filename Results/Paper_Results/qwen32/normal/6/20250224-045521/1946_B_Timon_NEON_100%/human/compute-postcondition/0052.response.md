Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `new_segment` is true, `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < 0`, `new_segment[0]` is also updated by adding `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it if `max_segment[0]` (updated) is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` includes `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. `new_segment` is an empty list after the else part. If `new_segment` is false, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains undefined.**
