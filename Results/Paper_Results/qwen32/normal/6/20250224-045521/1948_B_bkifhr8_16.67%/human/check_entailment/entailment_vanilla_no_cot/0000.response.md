Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in the Loop**: The loop that checks and modifies the array only considers the immediate previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation. For example, consider the array `[12, 30, 2]`. The program would only split `30` into `3` and `0` if it directly follows a number greater than `30`, which is not the case here. The correct approach should be to attempt to split any number that is greater than or equal to 10 and check if the array can be sorted after each split.

2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check**: The program only makes one pass through the list and attempts to split only when a condition is met, but it does not recheck the entire list after each split. This means that it might miss opportunities to split numbers that could make the array sortable.

3. **Lack of Iteration**: The program should iteratively attempt to split numbers and check if the array is sorted until no more splits can be made or the array is sorted. The current implementation does not do this.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a more thorough approach that repeatedly attempts to split numbers and checks if the array can be sorted. Here's a possible way to do it:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        new_a = []
        for num in a:
            if num >= 10:
                new_a.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
                changed = True
            else:
                new_a.append(num)
        a = new_a
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This code defines a function `can_be_sorted` that repeatedly splits numbers in the array and checks if the array can be sorted. It continues to do this until no more splits are made or the array is sorted.
