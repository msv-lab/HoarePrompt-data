Reasoning:  
The provided Python program has a logical flaw in its approach to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the allowed operations. The program checks if the current element is greater than the next one and if it's greater than 10, it splits the number into its digits and inserts them back into the list. However, this process is only done once for each pair of elements that are out of order, and it does not handle all possible scenarios where the array can be sorted by multiple operations.

For example, in the second test case of the provided example, the array is `[12, 28, 5]`. The program checks the first pair `(12, 28)` and finds them in order, then checks the second pair `(28, 5)` and finds them out of order. Since `28 > 5` and `28 > 10`, it splits `28` into `2` and `8`, resulting in the array `[12, 2, 8, 5]`. However, the program does not continue to check if further operations can sort the array. In this case, the correct sequence of operations would be to split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, and then split `8` (which is not greater than `5` and thus not split), but we can see that further operations are needed to sort the array completely. The program does not perform these additional operations, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the array cannot be sorted.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but the main logic for splitting numbers and checking the array does not account for all possible sorting sequences.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
