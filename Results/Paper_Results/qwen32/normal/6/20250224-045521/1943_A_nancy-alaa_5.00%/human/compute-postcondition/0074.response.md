The provided code snippet updates the `arr` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. This means the previous value of `arr` is replaced with the new list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the previous `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is equal to the input integer.**
