To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
2. `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
4. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. `first` is a boolean.
6. `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state description.
- The condition that breaks out of the loop or if statement is when `i` is not a key in `mpp`. However, this condition does not affect the value of `i` directly in the `print` statement.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i`.

### Determining the Output:
- We don't have the exact value of `i` before the increment, but we know that `i` is incremented by 1.
- The exact value of `i` after the increment is not provided, but we can describe it as `i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of i before the increment)**
