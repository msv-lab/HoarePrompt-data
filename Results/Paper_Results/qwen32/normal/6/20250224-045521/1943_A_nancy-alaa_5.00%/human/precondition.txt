t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
