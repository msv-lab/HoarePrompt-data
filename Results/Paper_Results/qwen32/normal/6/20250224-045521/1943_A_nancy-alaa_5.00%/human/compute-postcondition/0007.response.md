Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the precondition, we know that `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary, but it does not specify an explicit value for `i`. Since `i` is not defined by any formula or condition in the given information, we can only say that `i` is a variable that does not exist as a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.

However, the problem does not provide an explicit value for `i`, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value that `i` holds. Based on the information provided, `i` could be any integer that is not a key in `mpp`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe it as a variable that is not a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that is not a key in the mpp dictionary)**
