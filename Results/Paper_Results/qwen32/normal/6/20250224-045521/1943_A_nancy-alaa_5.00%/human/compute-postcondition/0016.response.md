Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean. If `first` is True and `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary with a frequency of 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
