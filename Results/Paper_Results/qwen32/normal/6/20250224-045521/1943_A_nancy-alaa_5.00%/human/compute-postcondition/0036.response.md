In this task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer input. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the range function, which means we can only adjust the input integer that determines the range.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`
- `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1, otherwise it remains False
- `i` is equal to `n`

The loop is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To execute the loop one more time, the range function in the for loop needs to be adjusted. The range function depends on the integer input, which is `t` in this case. Since `t` determines how many times the loop will run, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1, ensuring it remains greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1, otherwise it remains False; `i` is equal to `n`**
