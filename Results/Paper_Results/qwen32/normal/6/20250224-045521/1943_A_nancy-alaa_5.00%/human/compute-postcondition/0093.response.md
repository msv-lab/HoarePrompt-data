To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and see how it affects the value of `i`.

1. **Initial State Details:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 - 1\). This variable is not directly related to the `print(i)` statement.
   - `n` is greater than 0. This variable is also not directly related to the `print(i)` statement.
   - `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input. The contents of `arr` are not specified.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`. The contents of `mpp` depend on the contents of `arr`.
   - `first` is a boolean value. This variable is not directly related to the `print(i)` statement.
   - `i` is incremented by 1. This means `i` is initially some value and is increased by 1 before the `print(i)` statement is executed.
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. This condition does not affect the value of `i` at the point of printing since it only controls the flow of the loop.

2. **Determining the Value of `i`:**
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement. Therefore, the value printed will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.
   - Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `i_initial`. After the increment, the value of `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.
   - Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `i_initial`.

Output: **i_initial + 1 (where i_initial is the initial value of i before it is incremented by 1)**
