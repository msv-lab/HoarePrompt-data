Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value. If `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 and `first` is True, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
