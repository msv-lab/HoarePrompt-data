Let's break down the given initial state and the `print` statement to determine the output.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`.
- `first` is True.
- `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1.
- The most internal loop or if statement has not been broken out of.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(i)
```

**Analysis:**
- The variable `i` is described as a key in the `mpp` Counter object with a frequency of 1. This means that `i` is an element that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the information given, which is that `i` is an element in `arr` that appears exactly once.

**Output:**
Output: **i (where i is an element in arr that appears exactly once)**
