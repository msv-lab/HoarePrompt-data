### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed according to the rules of the game. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through the range `[0, n)` to find the smallest non-negative integer that either:
   - Does not appear in the array `a` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
   - Appears exactly once in the array `a` (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1`).

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The program ensures that if there are multiple integers that meet the criteria, the smallest one is chosen. This is achieved by the order of the checks and the `first` flag, which ensures that the first occurrence of a single element is considered after all missing elements.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX under the given constraints. Here's how the program handles the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 4`, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - `mpp` will be `{0: 2, 1: 2}`.
  - The smallest missing or single element is `2` (since `0` and `1` appear more than once).

- **Second Test Case**: `n = 4`, `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `mpp` will be `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`.
  - The smallest missing or single element is `0` (since all elements from `0` to `3` appear exactly once, and `4` is not present).

- **Third Test Case**: `n = 2`, `a = [1, 1]`
  - `mpp` will be `{1: 2}`.
  - The smallest missing or single element is `0` (since `0` is not present).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the MEX for each test case based on the described optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Hence, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
