The code snippet provided assigns a new list of integers to the variable `arr` based on the input. This input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers which is then converted to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. 

Since the input operation changes the value of `arr`, we need to update our output state to reflect this change. The values of `t`, `n`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the original `arr`; `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1 in the original `arr`, otherwise it remains False; `i` is equal to the new `n`.**
