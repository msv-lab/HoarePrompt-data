To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero**: This gives us a relationship between `k` and `ul`, but it doesn't directly provide the value of `a[i]`.
2. **`ul` remains unchanged**: This indicates that `ul` is a constant or has a value that doesn't change in this context.
3. **`n` must be greater than 0**: This tells us that `n` is a positive integer, but it doesn't directly provide the value of `a[i]`.
4. **`l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1**: This indicates that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 1. This gives us a condition on `a[i]`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `a[i]` is not directly provided, but we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Deduction:
Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `a[i]` must be an index such that the element at position `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 1. However, without the specific values of `l` or the exact value of `a[i]`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. 

### Conclusion:
The code will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since we don't have the exact value of `a[i]`, we describe it based on the condition provided.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that l[a[i] - 1] equals 1)**
