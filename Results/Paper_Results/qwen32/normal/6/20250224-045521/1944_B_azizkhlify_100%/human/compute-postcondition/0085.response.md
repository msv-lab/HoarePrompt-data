The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 0. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet provided. The only change is in the value of `ur`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, `ur` is increased by 2.**
