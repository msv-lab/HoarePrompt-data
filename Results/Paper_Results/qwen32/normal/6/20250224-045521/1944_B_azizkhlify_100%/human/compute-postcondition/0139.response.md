The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` to 0. The values of `n` and the increment of `i` are not directly affected by this operation. The only change is in the list `l` at the specified index.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0**.
