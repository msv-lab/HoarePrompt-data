To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')
```
This loop iterates over the elements in the list `res` and prints each element followed by a space. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `res`.

From the given output states after the first three iterations:
1. After 1 iteration, `res` contains at least one element.
2. After 2 iterations, `res` contains more than one element, and `i` is the second element in `res`.
3. After 3 iterations, `res` contains more than one element, and `i` is the third element in `res`.

This indicates that the loop will continue to iterate over each element in `res` until all elements have been printed.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `r` remains the same.
- `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends.
- `ur` remains `0`.
- If `k` is non-zero, `i` will be the last element in `res` after the loop completes, or the value of `i` when `re` equals `k`.
- If `k` is zero, `i` remains unchanged.
- `re` is the total number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop breaks due to `re` reaching `k`).
- `res` contains all elements from `a` that had a count of `1` in `l` up to the point of breaking or completing all iterations.
- The loop will have printed all elements in `res`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **all elements in `res` are printed, separated by spaces.**
