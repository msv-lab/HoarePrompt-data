To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This tells us that the value of `a[i] - 1` is an index into the list `r` where the value is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` must be an integer such that `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified directly; it could be any integer that satisfies the condition `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not given, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that r[a[i] - 1] = 2)**
