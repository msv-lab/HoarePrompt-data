To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to focus on the value of `a[i]` at the time the statement is executed. The initial state provides us with some information, but it does not explicitly state the values of the list `a` or the variable `i`.

Given:
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 2, we need to know the value at index 2 of the list `a`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific values of the list `a`. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is in terms of the value at index 2 of the list `a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Given `i` is 2, the statement will print the value at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the value at index 2 of the list `a`)**
