Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early or the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` remains an empty list, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is 0 after the loop completes, and `re` remains 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, then `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing elements `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `re` is the count of elements in `res`. In both cases, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a list containing at least one element, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is 0 (initially, before the loop starts)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is a list containing at least two elements, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is the second element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a list containing at least three elements, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is the third element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
