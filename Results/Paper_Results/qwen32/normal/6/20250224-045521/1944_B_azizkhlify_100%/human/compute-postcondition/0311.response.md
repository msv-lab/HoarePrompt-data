To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus only on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `ur` is adjusted based on the condition `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`, but this does not affect the loop head.
- `ul` is unchanged.
- `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 0 if `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`, but this also does not affect the loop head.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 2`**.
