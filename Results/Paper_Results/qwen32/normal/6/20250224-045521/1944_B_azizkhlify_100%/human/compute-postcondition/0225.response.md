The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `a[1] - 1` where it is 2, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 2, `re` is 0**
