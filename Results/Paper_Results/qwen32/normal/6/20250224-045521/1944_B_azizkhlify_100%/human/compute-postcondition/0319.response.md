Postcondition: **`ul` is the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations, `ur` is 0 or incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `res` remains unchanged, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged except `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `i` is the last element in `res`, `re` is the count of elements in `res`, and `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1` or the value where `ul` equals `ur`.**
