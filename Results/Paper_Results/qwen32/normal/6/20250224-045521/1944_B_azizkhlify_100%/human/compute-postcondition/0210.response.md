Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement. The value of `ur` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.**
