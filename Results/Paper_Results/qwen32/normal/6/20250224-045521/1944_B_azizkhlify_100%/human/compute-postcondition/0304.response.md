To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider only the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, `2 * n`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ur` and `ul` are unchanged and do not affect the loop head directly.
- The loop will break if `ul` equals `ur`, but this does not impact the adjustment of the loop head variables.

Since `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. The values of `n` and `2 * n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is unchanged, `ul` is unchanged**.
