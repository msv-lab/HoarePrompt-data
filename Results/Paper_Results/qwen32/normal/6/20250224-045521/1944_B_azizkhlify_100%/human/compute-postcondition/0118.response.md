The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 2, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
