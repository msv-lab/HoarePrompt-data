To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k`: An integer obtained from the input.
- `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input (the exact values are not provided).
- `l`: A list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with the exception that if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0.
- `ul`: 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0.
- `ur`: 0.
- `r`: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re`: 0.
- `res`: An empty list.
- `i`: Set to 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Variable Values:
- `i` is set to 2, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Output Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, with `end=' '` indicating that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical values of `a[2]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list a)**
