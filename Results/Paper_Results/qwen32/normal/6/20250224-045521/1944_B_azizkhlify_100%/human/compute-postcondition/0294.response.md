Postcondition: **`ul` is the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` remains unchanged, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is the last element in `res`, `re` is the count of elements in `res`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`.**
