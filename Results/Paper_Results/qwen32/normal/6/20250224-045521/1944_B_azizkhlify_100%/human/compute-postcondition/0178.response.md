Postcondition: **`k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and remains non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is the number of iterations performed (either `n` or the iteration count at which `re` equals `k`); `re` is the count of elements in `a` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point of loop termination; `res` contains all such elements `a[i]`; `a` and `l` remain unchanged. If `k` is zero after the update, no further changes are made to `n`, `i`, `re`, `res`, `a`, or `l`.**
