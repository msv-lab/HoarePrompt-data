Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, `ul` is 2, and `ur` is 0; otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged, `ul` is 0, and `ur` is 0.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then `ul` remains `k * 2`; otherwise, `ul` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- The print statement prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.
- Therefore, the print statement will output `a[1]` twice.

### Conclusion:
The value printed will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] **
