Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with the exception that `l[a[2] - 1]` is now 0 if `l[a[2] - 1]` was 2; `ul` is 2 if `l[a[2] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0; `ur` is 0; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, the program continues without any change to the variables.**
