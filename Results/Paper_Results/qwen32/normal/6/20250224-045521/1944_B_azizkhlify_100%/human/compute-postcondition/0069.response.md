Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early; `ur` is 0; `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 2. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `re` and `res` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
