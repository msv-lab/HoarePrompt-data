To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the provided loop and the given conditions. The loop iterates over the range from `n` to `2 * n` and performs specific actions based on the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` ranging from `n` to `2 * n`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each `i`, it checks if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
3. **Action If Condition True**: If the condition is true, it prints `a[i]` twice and sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, then increments `ur` by 2.
4. **Break Condition**: If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until either `ul` equals `ur` or all iterations are completed.

### Final Output State Analysis

- **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
- **Condition Check**: For each `i`, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `a[i]` is printed twice, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2.
- **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur` during any iteration.

The final output state will be reached when either:
1. All iterations are completed (i.e., `i` reaches `2 * n`).
2. The condition `ul == ur` is met during one of the iterations, causing the loop to break.

Since the problem does not specify any specific values for `n`, `ul`, `ur`, `a`, or `r`, we can generalize the final state:

- **`i`**: Will be `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- **`ur`**: May be incremented by 2 for each element `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
- **`r`**: Elements that were 2 will be set to 0.
- **`ul`**: Remains unchanged unless the loop breaks due to `ul == ur`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`i` is `2 * n` or the loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each element `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, and those elements in `r` are set to 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will either complete all its iterations with `i` reaching `2 * n`, or it will break early when `ul` equals `ur`, modifying `r` and `ur` accordingly.
