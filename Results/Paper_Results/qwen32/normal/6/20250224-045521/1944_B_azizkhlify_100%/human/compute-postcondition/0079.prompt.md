Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `l` remains the same; `r` remains the same; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends; `ur` remains `0`. If `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` when `re` equals `k`. If `k` is zero, `i` remains unchanged. `re` is the total number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop breaks due to `re` reaching `k`); `res` contains all elements from `a` that had a count of `1` in `l` up to the point of breaking or completing all iterations. If `k` is zero, `res` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends, `ur` remains `0`, `res` contains at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends, `ur` remains `0`, `res` contains more than one element, `i` is the second element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends, `ur` remains `0`, `res` contains more than one element, `i` is the third element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
