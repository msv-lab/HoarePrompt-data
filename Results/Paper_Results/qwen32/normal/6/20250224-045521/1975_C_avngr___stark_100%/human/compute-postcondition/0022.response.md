The code snippet provided sorts the list `temp`. Given that `temp` is a slice of the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, the sorting operation will order the elements of this slice in ascending order. 

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i` are not affected by the sorting operation. The only variable that changes is `temp`, which now holds its elements in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is 4; `temp` is now the sorted slice `a[4:7]` of the list `a`.**
