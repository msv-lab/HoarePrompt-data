Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`. If `temp[1]` (the second smallest element of `temp`) is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the second smallest element of `temp`.**
