Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is the second element of `temp`, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The second element of `temp` is greater than `max`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the second element of `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
