The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (non-inclusive) and assigns this slice to the variable `temp`. The values of `t`, `n`, `max`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, so it is assumed that `i` is a valid index for slicing the list `a` without causing an `IndexError`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is 0, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
