The code snippet provided is `temp = a[i:i + 3]`, which slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (not inclusive) and assigns the result to the variable `temp`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `max`. The variable `temp` is newly introduced and holds a slice of the list `a`.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific values that `temp` will hold. However, we know that `temp` will be a list containing up to 3 elements from `a`, starting at index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is 0; `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
