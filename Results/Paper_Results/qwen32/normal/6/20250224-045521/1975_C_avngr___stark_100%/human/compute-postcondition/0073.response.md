The code snippet `max = temp[1]` assigns the value of the second element of the list `temp` to the variable `max`. Given that `temp` is the sorted list `a[1:4]`, the value of `max` will be the second smallest element in the sublist `a[1:4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is the sorted list `a[1:4]`, `max` is the second smallest element in `a[1:4]`.**
