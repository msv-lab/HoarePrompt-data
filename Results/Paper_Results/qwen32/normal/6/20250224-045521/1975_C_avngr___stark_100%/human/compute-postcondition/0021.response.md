The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to be a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to `i + 3`. Given that `i` is 4, `temp` will now hold the elements from index 4 to 6 of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is 4; `temp` is now the slice `a[4:7]` of the list `a`.**
