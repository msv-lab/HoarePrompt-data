The code snippet provided updates the list `a` by reading a new line of input and converting it into a list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `max`, and `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `a` is updated to the new list of integers obtained from the input. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is the integer value from the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.**
