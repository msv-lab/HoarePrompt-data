The code snippet sorts the list `temp`, which contains three elements from the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `i`. The only change is that the elements within the list `temp` are now in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`.**
