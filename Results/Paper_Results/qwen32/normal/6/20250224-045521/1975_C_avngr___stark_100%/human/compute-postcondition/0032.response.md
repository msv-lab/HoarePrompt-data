Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible 3-element sorted slices of the original list `a`. If `n` is equal to 2, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state. If `n` is not equal to 2, there is no change in the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `max`.**
