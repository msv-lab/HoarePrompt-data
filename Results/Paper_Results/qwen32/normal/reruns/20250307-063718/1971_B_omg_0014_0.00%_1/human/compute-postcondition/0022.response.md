The code snippet `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))` sorts the characters of the string `s` in reverse order and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted, `c` is the string `s` with its characters sorted in reverse order.**
