Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is the string formed by sorting the characters in `s`, and `c` is the string formed by sorting the characters in `s` in reverse order. If `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.**
