Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted, and `c` is the string `s` with its characters sorted in reverse order. If `b` equals `s`, then the condition `b == s` holds true; otherwise, it does not. In both cases, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain as specified.**
