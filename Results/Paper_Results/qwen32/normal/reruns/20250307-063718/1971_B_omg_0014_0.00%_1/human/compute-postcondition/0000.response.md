The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. Since the input is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `n` is an input integer.**
