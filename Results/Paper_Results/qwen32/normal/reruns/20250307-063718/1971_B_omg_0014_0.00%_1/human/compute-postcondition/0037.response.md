Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If the length of `a` is 2, no additional changes are made to `s`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. If the length of `a` is not 2, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. Regardless of the length of `a`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
