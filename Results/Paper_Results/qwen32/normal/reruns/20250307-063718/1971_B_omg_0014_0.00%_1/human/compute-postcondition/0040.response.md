Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then determines if the string has more than two distinct characters. If it does, the function outputs 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest string, whichever is not the original string. If the string has exactly two distinct characters, it outputs 'NO'.**
