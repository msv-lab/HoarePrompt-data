Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order, no additional changes are made to `s`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Regardless of whether `s` is sorted in ascending order or not, `i` is incremented by 1.**
