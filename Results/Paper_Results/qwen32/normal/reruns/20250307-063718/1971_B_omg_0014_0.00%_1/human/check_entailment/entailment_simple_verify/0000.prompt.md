You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user during the last iteration of the loop, `n` is the number of iterations which has been exhausted (i.e., `i` has reached `n`), and no further changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `s` after the loop ends.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly identifies strings that can be rearranged to form a different string.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if len(a) == 2:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')
    b = ''.join(sorted(s))
    c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
    if b == s:
        print(c)
    else:
        print(b)
```

The condition `if len(a) == 2:` checks if the string has exactly two unique characters. If it does, the program outputs "NO" because it incorrectly assumes that all rearrangements of a string with two unique characters will be the same as the original string. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the string "xyxyx". It has only two unique characters ('x' and 'y'), but it can be rearranged to form "xyxxy" or "yxyxy", which are different from the original string.

Here's a counterexample:
- Input: `xyxyx`
- Expected Output: `YES xyxxy` (or any other valid rearrangement)
- Actual Output: `NO`

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle strings with exactly two unique characters that can still be rearranged to form a different string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

If we want to fix this, we need to check if the string can be rearranged to form a different string more accurately. One way to do this is to check if there is at least one character that appears more than once in the string, which allows for rearrangement to form a different string. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)

# This version correctly handles strings with a single unique character.
```

However, since the original code does not handle the case where there are exactly two unique characters correctly, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
