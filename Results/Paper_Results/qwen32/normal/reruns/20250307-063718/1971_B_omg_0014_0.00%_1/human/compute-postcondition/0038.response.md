Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user during the last iteration of the loop, `n` is the number of iterations which has been exhausted (i.e., `i` has reached `n`), and no further changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `s` after the loop ends.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` represents the total number of iterations that were specified and have now been completed, and `s` holds the value of the string that was input during the last iteration of the loop. No further modifications are made to these variables after the loop finishes executing.
