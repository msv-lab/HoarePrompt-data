Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `if len(a) == 2` is incorrect for determining whether a rearrangement is possible. A string with 2 unique characters can still be rearranged unless all characters are the same (e.g., "aa"). The correct condition should check if all characters are the same, which can be done by comparing the length of the set to 1 (`if len(a) == 1:`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if all characters in the string are the same by checking if the length of the set of characters is 1. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and a rearranged string.
