The code snippet sorts the characters in the string `s` and assigns the result to a new variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted.**
