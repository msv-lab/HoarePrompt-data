You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then determines if the string has more than two distinct characters. If it does, the function outputs 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest string, whichever is not the original string. If the string has exactly two distinct characters, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Input**: 
   - Multiple test cases (up to 1000).
   - Each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters (length ≤ 10).

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, determine if it's possible to rearrange the string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
   - If possible, output "YES" and the rearranged string `r`.
   - If not possible, output "NO".

3. **Key Points**:
   - If a string consists of only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), it's impossible to rearrange it to form a different string.
   - If a string consists of exactly two unique characters and they are repeated in the same ratio as in the original string (e.g., "aabb"), it might be impossible to rearrange it to form a different string without additional logic.
   - For strings with more than two unique characters, it's generally possible to rearrange them to form a different string.

### Program Analysis

The program follows this logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, the string `s` is read.

2. **Checking Unique Characters**:
   - A set `a` is created from the string `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
   - If the length of `a` (number of unique characters) is 2, the program outputs "NO". This is based on the assumption that strings with exactly two unique characters cannot be rearranged to form a different string, which is not always true.

3. **Rearranging the String**:
   - If the length of `a` is not 2, the program outputs "YES".
   - It then sorts the string `s` in ascending order (`b`) and descending order (`c`).
   - If `b` (sorted string) is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (reverse sorted string). Otherwise, it prints `b`.

### Issues with the Program

- **Incorrect Handling of Two Unique Characters**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that any string with exactly two unique characters cannot be rearranged to form a different string. This is not true. For example, the string "aabb" can be rearranged to "abab" or "baba".
  
- **General Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles strings with more than two unique characters by sorting them, but the logic for handling strings with exactly two unique characters is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the flawed handling of strings with exactly two unique characters.

**Correctness:** **False**
