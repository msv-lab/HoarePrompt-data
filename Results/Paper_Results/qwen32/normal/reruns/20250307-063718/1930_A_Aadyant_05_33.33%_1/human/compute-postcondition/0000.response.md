The provided code snippet only includes a single line: `num = input()`. This line reads a line of input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, this input is expected to be the integer `t` representing the number of test cases.

Therefore, after executing the line `num = input()`, the variable `num` will hold the value of `t` as a string. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` will receive input through standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. `num` is a string holding the value of `t`.**
