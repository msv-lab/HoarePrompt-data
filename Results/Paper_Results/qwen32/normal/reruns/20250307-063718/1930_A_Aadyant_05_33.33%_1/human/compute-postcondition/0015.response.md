The code appends `int(list1[2 * i])` to `list2`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 * i` equals 4. Therefore, `int(list1[4])` is appended to `list2`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `numbers` is 0, `list2` contains three elements where the third element is `int(list1[4])`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` by whitespace, `a` must be greater than 2, `b` is the input string, `i` is 2**.
