The code snippet `out.append(sum(list2))` appends the sum of all elements in `list2` to the list `out`. The values of `num`, `numbers`, `list1`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only variable that is modified is `out`, which gains a new element, the sum of `list2`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `numbers` is 0, `list2` contains `a` elements where each element is `int(list1[2 * i])` for i ranging from 0 to a-1, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `b` is the input string, and `out` contains the sum of `list2` as its new element.**
