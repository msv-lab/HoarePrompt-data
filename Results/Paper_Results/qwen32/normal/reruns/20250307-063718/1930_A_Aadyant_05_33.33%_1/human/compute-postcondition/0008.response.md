The code splits the input string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to `list1`. The other variables (`num`, `numbers`, `list2`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `numbers` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer, `b` is the input string.**
