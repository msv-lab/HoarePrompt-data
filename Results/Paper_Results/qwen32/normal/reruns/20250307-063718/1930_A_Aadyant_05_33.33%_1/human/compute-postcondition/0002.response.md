The only variables in the loop head are `numbers` and `range(int(num))`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1, so that the loop can execute at least once. The variable `numbers` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `numbers` is 0**
