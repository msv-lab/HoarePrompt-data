The function `func` will receive input through standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.
