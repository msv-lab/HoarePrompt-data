The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `out`. No other variables are modified by this code. The initial state includes the function `func` receiving input through standard input, with `t` representing the number of test cases and `num` being a string holding the value of `t`. Since the code does not alter `t`, `num`, or any other variables related to the input, those remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` will receive input through standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. `num` is a string holding the value of `t`. `out` is an empty list.**
