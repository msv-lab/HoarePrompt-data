The code appends an additional element to `list2`, which is `int(list1[2 * i])`. Given that `i` is 1, the element being appended is `int(list1[2])`. 

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `numbers` is 0, `list2` contains two elements where the second element is `int(list1[2])`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` by whitespace, `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the input string, `i` is 1**.
