Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "STAIR" (`a < b < c`), a "PEAK" (`a < b > c`), and outputs "NONE" if neither condition is met. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
