The `print('NONE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. The string 'NONE' is explicitly provided within the print statement, and it will be printed as is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NONE**
