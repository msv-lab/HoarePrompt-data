The provided initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`) but does not provide specific values for any of them. The code snippet to be executed is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. 

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`, the output will be the string 'PEAK' as specified.

Output: **PEAK**
