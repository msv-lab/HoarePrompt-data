Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled by `n = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that processes each test case. It correctly iterates `n` times using `for i in range(n)`.

3. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The digits are correctly parsed as integers and unpacked into the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is implemented correctly with `if a < b < c: print('STAIR')`.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is implemented correctly with `elif a < b and b > c: print('PEAK')`.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it correctly outputs "NONE" with `else: print('NONE')`.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case based on the conditions described in the problem statement.

Since the program correctly handles input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result based on the given conditions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
