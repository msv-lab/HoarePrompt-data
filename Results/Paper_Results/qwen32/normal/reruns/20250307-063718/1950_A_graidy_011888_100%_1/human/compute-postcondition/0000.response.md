The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so it will be determined by the input.

After executing the code, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided, and the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `n` is an input integer.**
