Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. Additionally, if `a < b` and `b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b and b > c` does not hold.**
