Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a < b and b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. Additionally, if `a < b` and `b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b and b > c` does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true; otherwise, the condition `a < b and b > c` is evaluated, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain consistent with the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
