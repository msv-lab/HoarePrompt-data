The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the new integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial values, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the new integer values provided by the input.
