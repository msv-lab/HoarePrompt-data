The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input
- `n` is greater than 0
- The conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
