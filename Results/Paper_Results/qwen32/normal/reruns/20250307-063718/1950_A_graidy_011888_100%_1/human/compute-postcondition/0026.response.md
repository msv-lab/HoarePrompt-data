Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` has reached the value of `n`. The loop has executed `n` times, with each iteration reading new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions specified.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each of these `n` iterations, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
