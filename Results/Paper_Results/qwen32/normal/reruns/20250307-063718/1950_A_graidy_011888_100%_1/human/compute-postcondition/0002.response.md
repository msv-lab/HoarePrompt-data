The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, and `n` is greater than 0. After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0.**
