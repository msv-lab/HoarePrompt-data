The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
