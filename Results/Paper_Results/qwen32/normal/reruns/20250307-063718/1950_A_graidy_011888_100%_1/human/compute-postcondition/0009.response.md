The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('NONE')`.
2. The string `'NONE'` is explicitly provided in the statement.
3. No variables from the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
