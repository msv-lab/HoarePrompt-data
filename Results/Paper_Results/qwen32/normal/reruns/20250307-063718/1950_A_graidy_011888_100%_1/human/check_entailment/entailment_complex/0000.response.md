Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each test case, it checks if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program outputs the appropriate string for each test case based on the conditions.

The logic in the program matches the problem description perfectly. The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are checked correctly, and the default case of "NONE" is handled when neither condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
