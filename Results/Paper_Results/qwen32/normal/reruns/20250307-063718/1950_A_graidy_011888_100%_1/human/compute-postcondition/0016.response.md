The `print('NONE')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. The string `'NONE'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` function is called with the string `'NONE'`.
2. Since the string `'NONE'` is explicitly provided, the value to be printed is determined and does not change based on any variable values.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
