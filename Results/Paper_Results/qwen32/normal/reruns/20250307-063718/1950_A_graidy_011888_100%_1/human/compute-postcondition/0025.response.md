Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain consistent with the precondition.**
