Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0, but it is also not used in the provided code snippet.
- The condition that `a < b` and `b > c` is given, meaning `b` is a peak value between `a` and `c`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`, and there are no variables or expressions involved that change the string, the output will be exactly `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
