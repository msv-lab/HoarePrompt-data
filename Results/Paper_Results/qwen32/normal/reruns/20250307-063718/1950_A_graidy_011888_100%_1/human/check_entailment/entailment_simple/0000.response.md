### Reasoning:
The given program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

This logic directly matches the problem description:
- A "stair" is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A "peak" is defined as `a < b > c`.
- If neither condition is met, it should output "NONE".

The program iterates over all test cases and applies the correct logic to determine and print the appropriate result for each set of inputs.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
