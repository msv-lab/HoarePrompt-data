The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`, and mentions that `i` is incremented by 1. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`.
2. The string `'PEAK'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variables.
3. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
