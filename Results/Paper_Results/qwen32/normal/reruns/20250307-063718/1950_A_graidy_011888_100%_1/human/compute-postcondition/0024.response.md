Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether `a < b and b > c` is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain consistent with the precondition, with `i` being incremented by 1.**
