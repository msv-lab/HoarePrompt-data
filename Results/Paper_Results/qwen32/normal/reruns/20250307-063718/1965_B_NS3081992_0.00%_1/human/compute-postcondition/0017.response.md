The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, or `bk`. Therefore, the output state will include the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` with the addition of the newly initialized `ans` list.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list.**
