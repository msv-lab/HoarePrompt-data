The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `lk`, and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `lk`, `lk` is less than `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `lk` must be less than `l`, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1)), k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))]), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2`, `i` is `lk + 1`**
