### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Analysis:

The task is to generate a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( k \).
2. For all integers \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

#### Program Analysis:

The core logic is implemented in `func_14`. Let's break down the logic for both cases:

##### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)

1. **If \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The sequence is `[2]`. 
   - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and the only subsequence (which is the sequence itself) sums to 2.
   - **Annotation**: The sequence `[2]` is correctly generated when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 1 \).

2. **If \( n > 2 \)**:
   - The sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - **Annotation**: The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 2^{l-1}]` is generated where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - **Correctness**: This ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) (except 1) can be formed, but no subsequence sums to 1.

##### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)

1. **Initial Powers of 2**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the last bit).
   - **Annotation**: The sequence starts with `[1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{lk-2}]` where \( lk \) is the length of the binary representation of \( k \).
   - **Correctness**: This ensures that sums up to \( 2^{lk-1} - 1 \) can be formed.

2. **Next Number**:
   - The next number added is \( k - 1 - \text{sum of the previous numbers} \).
   - **Annotation**: The next number is calculated as \( k - 1 - \sum([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{lk-2}]) \).
   - **Correctness**: This ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

3. **Adding \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \)**:
   - The sequence then adds \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \).
   - **Annotation**: The numbers \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \) are added to the sequence.
   - **Correctness**: This ensures that sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be formed.

4. **Remaining Powers of 2**:
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - **Annotation**: The sequence appends `[2^{lk}, 2^{lk+1}, \ldots, 2^{l-1}]` where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - **Correctness**: This ensures that all required sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be formed.

### Correctness Check:

- **Case 1 (\( k = 1 \))**:
  - The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of 1 while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).
  - **Annotation**: The sequence `[2]` for \( n = 2 \) and `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 2^{l-1}]` for \( n > 2 \) are correctly generated.

- **Case 2 (\( k \neq 1 \))**:
  - The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of \( k \) while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).
  - **Annotation**: The sequence `[1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{lk-2}, k - 1 - \sum([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{lk-2}]), k + 1, 2k + 1, 2^{lk}, 2^{lk+1}, \ldots, 2^{l-1}]` is correctly generated.

### Conclusion:

The program follows a correct approach to generate the required sequence for both cases. The annotations confirm that the sequence is generated as intended, and the logic ensures that the conditions of the problem are met.

**Final: True**
