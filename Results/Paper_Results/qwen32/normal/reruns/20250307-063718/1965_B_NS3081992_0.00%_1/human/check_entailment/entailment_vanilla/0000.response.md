To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to generate a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to a given integer \( k \).
2. For all integers \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)), there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to \( v \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several utility functions for input handling, but the core logic is implemented in `func_14`. Let's break down `func_14`:

#### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
1. If \( n = 2 \), the sequence is `[2]`. This works because there is no subsequence that sums to 1, and the only subsequence that sums to 2 is the sequence itself.
2. For \( n > 2 \), the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \). This ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) (except 1) can be formed, but no subsequence sums to 1.

#### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)
1. The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the last bit).
2. The next number added is \( k - 1 - \text{sum of the previous numbers} \). This ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).
3. The sequence then adds \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \) to ensure that sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be formed.
4. Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1 (\( k = 1 \))**: The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of 1 while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).
- **Case 2 (\( k \neq 1 \))**: The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of \( k \) while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to follow a correct approach to generate the required sequence for both cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and logic.

Correctness: **True**
