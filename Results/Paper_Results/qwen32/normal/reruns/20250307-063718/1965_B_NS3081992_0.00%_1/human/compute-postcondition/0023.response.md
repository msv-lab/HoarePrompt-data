The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `lk`. Therefore, only these variables can be adjusted to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `lk - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`, and `lk` must be at least `3` (since `lk - 1` must be greater than the current `i` which is `2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and `lk` must be at least 3; `ans` is `[8, 2]`; `i` is `2`**
