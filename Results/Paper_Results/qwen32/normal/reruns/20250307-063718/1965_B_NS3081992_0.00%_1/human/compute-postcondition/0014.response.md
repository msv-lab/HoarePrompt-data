To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2 and continues until `i` reaches `l - 1` (since the range is `range(2, l)`). With each iteration, `2 ** i` is appended to the list `ans`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4]`.
- After 2 iterations, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
- After 3 iterations, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`.

This pattern suggests that for each iteration, `2 ** i` is added to `ans`. The loop will continue until `i` reaches `l - 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`, the final state of `ans` will be `[2, 3]` followed by `2 ** i` for each `i` from 2 to `l - 1`.

Since `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, the loop will run `l - 2` times (from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`).

For example, if `n = 8`, then `b = '1000'` and `l = 4`. The loop will run from `i = 2` to `i = 3`, resulting in `ans = [2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`.

To generalize, the final `ans` list will be `[2, 3]` followed by `2 ** i` for `i` from 2 to `l - 1`.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario where `n` is the maximum possible value within the given constraints (`n = 10^6`). The binary representation of `10^6` has a length of 20 (`l = 20`). Thus, the loop will run from `i = 2` to `i = 19`.

The final `ans` list will be `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]**

In natural language, this means that the final list `ans` contains the initial values `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{19}\).
