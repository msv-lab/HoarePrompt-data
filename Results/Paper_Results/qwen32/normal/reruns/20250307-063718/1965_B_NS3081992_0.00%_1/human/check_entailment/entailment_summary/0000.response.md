### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating a sequence of integers for each test case such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all integers `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

The code provided contains several functions, but the core logic for solving the problem is implemented in `func_14`. Here's a breakdown of its approach:

1. **Input Handling**: `func_14` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Binary Representation**: It converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - If `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `[1, 2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
     - It then adds specific values derived from `k` to ensure the sequence meets the problem's requirements.
     - It continues adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

The function `func_15` is the main driver function that calls `func_14` for each test case and prints the results.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - **Subsequences Summing to `v` (where `v != k`)**:
    - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can be combined to form any sum that is a subset of these powers. For example, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` can form any sum that is a sum of a subset of these numbers.
    - The additional values (like `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`) are carefully chosen to ensure that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
  - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
    - The specific values added to the sequence (especially `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`) are chosen to avoid forming the sum `k`. This is because these values are strategically placed to break any combination that could sum to `k`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the approach taken by `func_14` and the overall logic of the program meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
