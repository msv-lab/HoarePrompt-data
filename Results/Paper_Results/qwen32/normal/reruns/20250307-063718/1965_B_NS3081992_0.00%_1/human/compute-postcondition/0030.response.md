The code snippet `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. The value of this new element is `2` raised to the power of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `ans` is a list with specific elements, and `i` is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be defined in the context where this code snippet is executed. Since `i` is not specified, we will keep it as `i` in the output state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `lk` must be less than `l`, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1)), k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))]), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `k` remain integers returned by `func_7()` within their specified ranges, `b` remains the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, and `lk` is still less than `l`. The list `ans` now includes an additional element `2 ** i` at the end.
