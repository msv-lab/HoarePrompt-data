The code snippet assigns the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
