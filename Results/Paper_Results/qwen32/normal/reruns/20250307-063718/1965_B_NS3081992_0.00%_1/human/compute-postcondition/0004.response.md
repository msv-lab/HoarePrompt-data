The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. However, the loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than the current iteration count.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1, which means the loop has already executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count. Since we do not have the exact iteration count, we can infer that it has executed once already, so `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 2; the value returned by `func_14()` is written to stdout followed by a newline character.**
