To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior and the outputs from the given loop and the conditions provided.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

From the problem statement, we know:
- `func_10()` returns a value that determines the number of iterations.
- `func_14()` returns a value that is printed to stdout followed by a newline character in each iteration.

Let's denote the value returned by `func_10()` as `n`. This means the loop will execute `n` times. The output after 3 iterations indicates that `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 2 for the loop to run at least 3 times.

To find the final output state, we need to consider the loop running `n` times, where `n` is the value returned by `func_10()`. Each iteration writes the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to stdout.

If `func_10()` returns `n`, the loop will execute `n` times, and the output will be the value returned by `func_14()` printed `n` times, each on a new line.

Since the exact value returned by `func_14()` is not specified, we can denote it as `x`. Therefore, the output after `n` iterations will be `x` printed `n` times, each on a new line.

In natural language, this means that the final output will consist of the value returned by `func_14()` printed as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`, with each occurrence on a new line.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **The value returned by `func_14()` printed `func_10()` times, each on a new line.**
