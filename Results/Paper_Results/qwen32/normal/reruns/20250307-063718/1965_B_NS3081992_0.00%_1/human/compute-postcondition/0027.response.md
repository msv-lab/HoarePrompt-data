The code snippet appends `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` will now include an additional element which is `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1)), k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))]), k + 1]`.**
