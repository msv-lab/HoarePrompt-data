The code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially `1`, the value `2 ** 1` (which is `2`) is appended to `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is `[8]`, so after appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[8, 2]`. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is `[8, 2]`; `i` is `1`**.
