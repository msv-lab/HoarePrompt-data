### Reasoning:

Let's carefully verify the correctness of the program by analyzing the logic in `func_14` in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to generate a sequence such that:
1. No subsequence sums to \( k \).
2. For all \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)), there is a subsequence that sums to \( v \).

#### Program Analysis:

##### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
- If \( n = 2 \), the sequence is `[2]`. This satisfies the conditions because:
  - There is no subsequence that sums to 1.
  - The only subsequence is `[2]`, which sums to 2.
- For \( n > 2 \):
  - The sequence starts with `[2, 3]`.
  - Then, it appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
  - This ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) (except 1) can be formed.
  - No subsequence can sum to 1 because the smallest number in the sequence is 2.

##### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)
- The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the last bit).
- The next number added is \( k - 1 - \text{sum of the previous numbers} \).
  - This ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) because the sum of all previous numbers plus this new number would equal \( k \).
- The sequence then adds \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \).
  - These numbers ensure that sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be formed.
- Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

1. **Case 1 (\( k = 1 \))**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sequence is `[2]`.
   - For \( n > 2 \), the sequence is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 and all other sums up to \( n \) can be formed.

2. **Case 2 (\( k \neq 1 \))**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the last bit).
   - The next number is \( k - 1 - \text{sum of the previous numbers} \).
   - This ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).
   - The sequence then adds \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \) to ensure that all sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be formed.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both cases as per the problem requirements. The logic in `func_14` ensures that the sequence meets the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
