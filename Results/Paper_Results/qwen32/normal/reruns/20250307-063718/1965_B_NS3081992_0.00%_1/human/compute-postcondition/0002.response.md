The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `func_10()` which determines the number of iterations. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we only need to adjust the state of `func_10()` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that is still greater than 0 after the current iteration is considered. This means that `func_10()` should return a value that is at least 1 more than the current iteration count.

Since the loop has just finished an iteration, the value returned by `func_10()` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 1; the value returned by `func_14()` is written to stdout followed by a newline character.**
