The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `lk + 1`, so `2 ** i` is `2 ** (lk + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `lk` must be less than `l`, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1)), k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))]), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2, 2 ** (lk + 1)]`, `i` is `lk + 1`**.
