In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `func_10()`. The underscore is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()` to ensure the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. The state before the loop starts does not mention any variables or states related to `func_10()`, so we need to specify that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
