To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i`. The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, l):`, meaning `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`
- `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `l` is at least 3
- `k` is equal to 1
- `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 3
- `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2 (since the loop starts at 2 and we are at the end of the first iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `ans` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `l` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 3, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`, `i` is 3**
