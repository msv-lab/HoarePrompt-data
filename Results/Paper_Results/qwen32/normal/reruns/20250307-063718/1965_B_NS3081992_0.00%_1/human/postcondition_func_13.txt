The function `func_14` generates and returns a string based on the values of two integers `n` and `k` obtained from `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a sequence of integers derived from transformations involving powers of 2 and specific arithmetic operations on `k`, and returns this sequence as a space-separated string.
