Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k == 1`, the program does not modify `n` or `k`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to a sequence starting from 1, including powers of 2 up to `2^(log2(k-1))`, followed by `k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))])`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)`.**
