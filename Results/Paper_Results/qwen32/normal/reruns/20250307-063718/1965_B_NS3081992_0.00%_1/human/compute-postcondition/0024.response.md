The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `2`, `2 ** i` equals `4`. Therefore, the list `ans` which was initially `[8, 2]` will now be `[8, 2, 4]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and `lk` must be at least 3; `ans` is `[8, 2, 4]`; `i` is `2`**
