The given code snippet writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` to the standard output (stdout), followed by a newline character. The initial state only specifies a precondition about `func_10()` returning a value greater than 0, which does not affect the execution of this code snippet. The code snippet itself does not modify any variables or states other than writing to stdout.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0; the value returned by `func_14()` is written to stdout followed by a newline character.**
