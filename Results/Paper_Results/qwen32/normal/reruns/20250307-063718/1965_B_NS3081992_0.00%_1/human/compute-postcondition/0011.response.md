The given code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 3, `2 ** i` evaluates to 8. Therefore, `ans` will now include this new value.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be at least 3, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`. After appending `2 ** i` to `ans`, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 2, 8]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `l` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 3, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 8]`, `i` is 3**.
