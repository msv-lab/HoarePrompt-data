The code snippet writes the value returned by `func_14()` to stdout followed by a newline character. Since the value returned by `func_14()` is written to stdout, it does not affect any variables directly in the given initial state. The precondition that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2 remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the provided code snippet. 

Output State: **the value returned by `func_14()` is written to stdout followed by a newline character; `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2.**
