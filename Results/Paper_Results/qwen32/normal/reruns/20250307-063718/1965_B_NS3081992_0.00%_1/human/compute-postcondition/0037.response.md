To determine the output state, we need to understand the transformations applied to `k` based on the given conditions and then format the final result as a space-separated string of the sequence `ans`.

Here's how the transformations work:
1. If `k == 1`, then `k` remains unchanged.
2. Otherwise, `k` is updated to a sequence starting from 1, including powers of 2 up to `2^(log2(k-1))`, followed by `k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))])`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:
- Calculate `log2(k-1)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than `k-1`.
- Generate a list of powers of 2 up to `2^(log2(k-1))`.
- Calculate the remaining value to be added to the sequence: `k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(log2(k-1))])`.
- Append `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
- Calculate and append the remaining powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.

The final sequence is then joined into a space-separated string and returned.

Given the complexity of the transformation, let's denote the final sequence as `ans`. The output state will be the space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.

Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of the sequence 'ans' which is derived based on the transformations applied to 'k' as described.**
