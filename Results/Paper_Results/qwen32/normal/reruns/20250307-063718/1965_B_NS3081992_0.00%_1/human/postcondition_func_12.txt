The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = GCD(a, b)`, along with the GCD itself. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns the coefficients and the GCD as determined by the algorithm.
