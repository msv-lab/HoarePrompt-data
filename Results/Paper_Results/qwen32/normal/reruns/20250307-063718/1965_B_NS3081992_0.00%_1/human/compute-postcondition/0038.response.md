Functionality: **The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a string. In Case_1, if the conditions on `n` and `k` lead to a specific scenario (which is not detailed here), the function returns the string '1\n2'. In Case_2, the function returns a space-separated string representing a sequence 'ans' that is derived based on some transformations applied to `k`.**
