You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not always generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The sequence `a` must not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_14()` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case.
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence `a` is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `2`, which is incorrect because there is no subsequence that sums to `1`.
     - For other values of `n`, it returns a sequence that does not guarantee the absence of a subsequence summing to `1`.
   - For `k != 1`, the sequence `a` is constructed by adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`, then adding `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, followed by additional powers of 2.
     - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` can lead to subsequences that sum to `k`, which violates the first condition.
     - The value `k - 1 - sum(ans)` might not be correctly calculated to ensure all sums up to `n` except `k` are possible.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `n = 6` and `k = 1`.
     - The program returns `2 3 4`.
     - Here, the subsequence `[2, 3]` sums to `5`, but there is no subsequence that sums to `1`.
     - However, the problem specifies that there should be a subsequence for every `v` from `1` to `n` except `k`. For `v = 1`, there should be a subsequence that sums to `1`, which is not the case here.
   - Consider another input `n = 9` and `k = 3`.
     - The program returns `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`.
     - Here, the subsequence `[1, 1, 1]` sums to `3`, which violates the first condition.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
