You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to generate a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to a given integer \( k \).
2. For all integers \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)), there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to \( v \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several utility functions for input handling, but the core logic is implemented in `func_14`. Let's break down `func_14`:

#### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
1. If \( n = 2 \), the sequence is `[2]`. This works because there is no subsequence that sums to 1, and the only subsequence that sums to 2 is the sequence itself.
2. For \( n > 2 \), the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \). This ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) (except 1) can be formed, but no subsequence sums to 1.

#### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)
1. The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the last bit).
2. The next number added is \( k - 1 - \text{sum of the previous numbers} \). This ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).
3. The sequence then adds \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \) to ensure that sums up to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be formed.
4. Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1 (\( k = 1 \))**: The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of 1 while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).
- **Case 2 (\( k \neq 1 \))**: The logic correctly generates a sequence that avoids the sum of \( k \) while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to follow a correct approach to generate the required sequence for both cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and logic.

Correctness: **True**
