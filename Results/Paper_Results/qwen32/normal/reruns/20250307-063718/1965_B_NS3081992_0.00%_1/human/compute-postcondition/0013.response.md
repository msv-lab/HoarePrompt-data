The code snippet `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 4`, which is `16`. Therefore, `16` is appended to the list `ans`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `n` must be at least 8 to ensure `l` is at least 4, `k` is equal to 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 4, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 8, 16]`, `i` is 4**.
