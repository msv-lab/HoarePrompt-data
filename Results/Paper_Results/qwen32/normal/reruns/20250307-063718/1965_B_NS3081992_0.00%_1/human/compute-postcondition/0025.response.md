To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the structure and behavior of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `lk - 2` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the upper bound). Therefore, the loop will execute `lk - 1` times.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the value of `lk` and the contents of `ans` at each step:

- After 1 iteration (`i = 0`), `ans` is `[1]` (not `[8]` as stated in the problem, which seems to be an error; it should be `[1]` since `2 ** 0 = 1`).
- After 2 iterations (`i = 1`), `ans` is `[1, 2]`.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 2`), `ans` is `[1, 2, 4]`.

From this pattern, we can see that after `lk - 1` iterations, `ans` will be `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)]`.

Since the loop runs `lk - 1` times, the final value of `i` will be `lk - 2`. Therefore, the final state of `ans` will be a list containing powers of 2 from `2 ** 0` to `2 ** (lk - 2)`.

Given that `lk` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)]`; `i` is `lk - 2`.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `ans` will contain a list of powers of 2 starting from `1` up to `2` raised to the power of `lk - 2`, where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. The loop variable `i` will be `lk - 2` after the loop completes.
