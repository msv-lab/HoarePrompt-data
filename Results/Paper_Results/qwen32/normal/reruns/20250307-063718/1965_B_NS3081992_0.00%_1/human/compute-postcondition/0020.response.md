The code snippet provided appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Given the context, it seems like `i` should be defined or there might be a loop or a previous part of the code that sets `i`. Since `i` is not provided, I'll assume that `i` is a specific variable that has been set to some value before this line of code is executed. For the sake of this example, let's assume `i` is a specific integer value, say `i = 3`.

Given this assumption, the code will append `2 ** 3` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will be `[8]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is `[8]`**.
