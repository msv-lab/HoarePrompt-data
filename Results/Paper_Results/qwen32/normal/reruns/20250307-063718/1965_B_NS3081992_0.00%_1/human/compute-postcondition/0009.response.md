The code snippet `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that the initial state specifies `ans` is `[2, 3]`, after this operation, `ans` will be `[2, 3, 2 ** i]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `l` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 3, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2 ** i]`**.
