The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`.**
