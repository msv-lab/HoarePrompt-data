The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `l` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4, and `l` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers returned by `func_7()`, where `n` must be at least 8 to ensure `l` is at least 4, `k` is equal to 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be at least 4, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 8]`, `i` is 4**
