Given the initial state:
- `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the expression `n * a`:
- `n` is a specific integer value.
- `a` is a specific integer value.
- The expression `n * a` represents the product of `n` and `a`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n * a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are specific integer values read from the input)**
