The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop body is omitted, so we only need to consider how the loop control variable `_` changes and how it relates to `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` has taken on one of the values from 0 to `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.

Given that `t` is a specific integer value read from the input and does not change during the loop iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `_`.

State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. If `a` >= `b`, the program does not modify `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. `_` is incremented by 1**
