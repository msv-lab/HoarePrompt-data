To determine the output of the print statement `print(n * a)`, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.
3. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. However, `b` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

The print statement `print(n * a)` will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n * a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are specific integer values read from the input)**
