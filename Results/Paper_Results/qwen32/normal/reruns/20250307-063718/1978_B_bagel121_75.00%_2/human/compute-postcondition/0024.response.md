The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `k` are already defined in the initial state. Specifically, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. The value of `t` is also provided but not used in the given code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes its value is `p2`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
