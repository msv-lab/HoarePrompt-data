The code snippet `p2 = (n - k) * a` calculates the value of `p2` based on the given variables `n`, `k`, and `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `p2`.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
