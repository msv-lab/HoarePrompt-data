### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, given the usual price `a` and the price of the first bun `b` under a promotional scheme.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price for the first bun), Bob should not use the promotion because selling all buns at the usual price will yield the maximum profit. Therefore, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, Bob should use the promotion. The optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because selling more than `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price would result in a price drop below the usual price `a`, which would be less profitable.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two values.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`. However, selling `k = 1` yields the maximum profit:
     - Profit from first bun: `5`
     - Profit from remaining buns: `3 * 4 = 12`
     - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. Selling all buns at the modified price yields the maximum profit:
     - Profit: `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Since `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price:
     - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. Selling all buns at the modified price yields the maximum profit:
     - Profit: `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
   - Since `a = b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price:
     - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
   - Since `a > b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price:
     - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`. Selling all buns at the modified price yields the maximum profit:
     - Profit: `1000 + 999 + ... + 1 = 500500`

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem's requirements.
