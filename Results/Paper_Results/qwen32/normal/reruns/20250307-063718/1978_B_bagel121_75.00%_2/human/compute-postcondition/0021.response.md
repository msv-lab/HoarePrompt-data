Given the initial state, we know that `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. The variable `t` is also an integer value read from the input, but it is not used in the provided print statement. The print statement is:

```python
print(n * a)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to calculate the product of `n` and `a`. Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The output will be the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are specific integer values read from the input)**
