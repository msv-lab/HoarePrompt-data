The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases that will follow, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the initial state, `t` was described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the specific integer value that was read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**
