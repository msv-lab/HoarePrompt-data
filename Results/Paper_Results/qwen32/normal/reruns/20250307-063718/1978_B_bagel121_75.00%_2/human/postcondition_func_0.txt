The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, which is the sum of the minimum cost to select `n` items where the first `k` items (up to `b - a + 1` or `n`) are selected at costs from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining items (if any) are selected at cost `a`.
