To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans + p2)` statement, we need to break down the calculations and understand the values of the variables `ans` and `p2` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` is an integer input where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This variable is not directly used in the calculation of `ans` or `p2`, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.

2. **Variables `n`, `a`, and `b`:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.
   - These values are crucial for calculating `k`, `ans`, and `p2`.

3. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is defined as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This means:
     \[
     k = \min(b - a + 1, n)
     \]

4. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the floor function:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{(2b - k + 1)}{2} \times k \right\rfloor
     \]
   - This formula calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers in the range from `a` to `b`.

5. **Variable `p2`:**
   - `p2` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{p2} = (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This term accounts for the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, all of which are equal to `a`.

6. **Final Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of `ans` and `p2`:
     \[
     \text{print(ans + p2)}
     \]

### Output Description:

The output of the print statement will be the sum of the `k` largest numbers in the range from `a` to `b` and the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, all of which are equal to `a`.

Given the initial state, the output can be described as:
Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest numbers in the range from a to b, and p2 is the sum of the remaining n - k numbers, all of which are equal to a)**

To make it more precise, we can express it as:
Output: **\(\left\lfloor \frac{(2b - k + 1)}{2} \times k \right\rfloor + (n - k) \times a\) (where \(k = \min(b - a + 1, n)\))**
