In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, but the loop will execute `t` times based on the value of `t`. 

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use. The loop will execute `t` times regardless of the value of `_`. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Since `t` is already specified to be between 1 and 10^4, and it is given that `t` is the number of test cases, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment in terms of the loop head variables. The state is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is the specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
