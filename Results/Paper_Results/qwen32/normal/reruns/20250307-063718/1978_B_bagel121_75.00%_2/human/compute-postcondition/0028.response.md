The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 10^4. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, the function receives three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, each satisfying 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case.**
