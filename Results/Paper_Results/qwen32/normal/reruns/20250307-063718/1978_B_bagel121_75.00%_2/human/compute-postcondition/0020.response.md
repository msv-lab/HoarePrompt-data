The provided code snippet reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This affects the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` but does not modify `t`. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `p2`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet and remain in their initial states since they are not initialized or modified here.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.**
In natural language: The variable `t` retains its initial value, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values read from the input. Other variables remain unchanged.
