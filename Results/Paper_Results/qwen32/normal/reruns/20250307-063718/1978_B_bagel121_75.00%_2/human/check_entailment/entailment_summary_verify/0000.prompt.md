You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, which is the sum of the minimum cost to select `n` items where the first `k` items (up to `b - a + 1` or `n`) are selected at costs from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining items (if any) are selected at cost `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `b - k + 1` coins. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. The logic used in the program is as follows:
- If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Otherwise, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

Let's verify the logic:
1. **Case 1: `a >= b`**
   - If the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.
   - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   
2. **Case 2: `a < b`**
   - Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's check some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:
- **Edge Case 1:** `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Here, `a >= b`, so the program should print `1 * 1 = 1`.
- **Edge Case 2:** `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`
  - Here, `a < b`, so the program should print `2` (selling the only bun at the modified price).
- **Edge Case 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 1`, `b = 10`
  - Here, `a < b`, so the program should print the sum of the first 10 natural numbers, which is `55`.
- **Edge Case 4:** `n = 10`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Here, `a >= b`, so the program should print `10 * 1 = 10`.
- **Edge Case 5:** `n = 10`, `a = 5`, `b = 10`
  - Here, `a < b`, so the program should print the sum of the first 6 terms of the sequence starting from 10 and decreasing by 1 each time plus the profit from the remaining 4 buns sold at the usual price `a`. This is `51 + 4 * 5 = 71`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the edge cases we tested. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
