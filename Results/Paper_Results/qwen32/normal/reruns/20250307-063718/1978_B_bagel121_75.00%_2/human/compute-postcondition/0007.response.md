To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and how it modifies the variables. The code calculates `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- The expression inside the `int` function is `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.
- `a` is less than `b`.
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

After the code is executed, the variable `ans` will hold the calculated value, and other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) will retain their initial values unless explicitly modified.

Let's express `ans` in terms of the given variables:
- `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**.
