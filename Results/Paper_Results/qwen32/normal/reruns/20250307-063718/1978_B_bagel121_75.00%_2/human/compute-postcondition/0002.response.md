The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are newly introduced and assigned specific integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.**
