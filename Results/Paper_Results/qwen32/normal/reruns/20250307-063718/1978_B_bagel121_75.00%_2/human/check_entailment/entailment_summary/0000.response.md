### Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, considering a promotional price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of buns `n`, the usual price `a`, and the promotional starting price `b`.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the promotional starting price `b`, it's more profitable to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Hence, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the promotional price. This `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` (the number of distinct promotional prices) and `n` (the total number of buns).
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the promotional price is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series formula: `sum = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated total profit for each test case.

### Verification:
The program's logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly. For example:
- When `a >= b`, it correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` because selling at the usual price is more beneficial.
- When `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit correctly by summing the promotional prices and usual prices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
