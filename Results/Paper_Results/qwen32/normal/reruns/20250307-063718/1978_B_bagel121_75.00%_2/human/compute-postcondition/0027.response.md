To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and initial state.

The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it calculates and prints a specific value.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
- If `a >= b`, it prints `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, it calculates:
  - `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
  - `ans` as the integer value of the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` with a common difference of `-1`, which simplifies to `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
  - `p2` as `(n - k) * a`.
  - It then prints `ans + p2`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, after all iterations, the output state will be the series of printed values corresponding to each of the `t` inputs.

Given that the loop does not modify `t` or any other variables outside of its local scope (i.e., `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2`), the final output state is simply the sequence of printed values.

**Output State:** **The output state is a sequence of `t` printed values, each determined by the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` for that iteration as described above.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the series of results printed by the loop for each of the `t` test cases.
