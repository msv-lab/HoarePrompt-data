You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, with the option to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price.
2. **Modified Price**: The price of the `i-th` bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
3. **Usual Price**: The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
4. **Constraints**: `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
    - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
    - If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price of the first bun), it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. This is because the modified price is not beneficial in this scenario.
    - Otherwise, the program calculates the optimal `k` which is `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price dropping below `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
    - For the first `k` buns sold at the modified price, the profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
    - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price, the profit is `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
    - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `ans + p2`.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case** (`n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`):
    - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
    - Profit from first 2 buns: `ans = (5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9`.
    - Profit from remaining 2 buns: `p2 = 2 * 4 = 8`.
    - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`. However, the optimal `k` should be 1, leading to `ans = 5` and `p2 = 12`, resulting in `5 + 12 = 17`. The program logic seems incorrect here.

2. **Second Test Case** (`n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`):
    - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
    - Profit from first 5 buns: `ans = (9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 35`.
    - Profit from remaining 0 buns: `p2 = 0`.
    - Total profit: `35`.

3. **Third Test Case** (`n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`):
    - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `n * a = 100`.

### Conclusion:

Upon closer inspection, the program's logic for determining the optimal `k` seems flawed. Specifically, the formula for `k` should be reconsidered to ensure it maximizes profit. The program does not correctly handle the case where `a < b` and the optimal `k` might be less than `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
