To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer value read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.
- `k` is calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

### Calculations:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`
   - This means `k` is the smaller value between the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive and `n`.

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`
   - This formula calculates the sum of the `k` largest integers in the range from `a` to `b`. The expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2` computes the average of the largest `k` numbers, and multiplying by `k` gives the sum.

3. **Calculate `p2`:**
   - `p2 = (n - k) * a`
   - This calculates the sum of the remaining `n - k` smallest integers in the range from `a` to `b`, each multiplied by `a`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement computes `ans + p2`.
- `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest integers in the range from `a` to `b`.
- `p2` is the sum of the remaining `n - k` smallest integers in the range from `a` to `b`, each multiplied by `a`.

### Output:
The final printed value is the sum of `ans` and `p2`, which represents the weighted sum of integers in the range from `a` to `b` based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest integers from a to b, and p2 is the sum of the remaining n - k smallest integers from a to b, each multiplied by a)**
