The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as the range is not exhausted, meaning `_` will take on values from 0 to `t-1`.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `_` will simply be the next integer in the sequence from 0 to `t-1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then no additional changes are made to `a`, `b`, `n`, or `t`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

To execute one more time, `_` should be the next integer in the sequence. If the previous value of `_` was `i-1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `i`.

Example:
If the previous value of `_` was 0, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 1.
If the previous value of `_` was 1, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2.

Therefore, if the previous value of `_` was `i-1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `i`.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `_`, and it is simply a counter for the number of iterations, we only need to adjust `_`.

State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then no additional changes are made to `a`, `b`, `n`, or `t`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. `_` is the next integer in the sequence from 0 to `t-1`.**
