The value of `k` is assigned the result of the minimum between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**
