Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**

In simpler terms, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values. `k` remains the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The new variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
