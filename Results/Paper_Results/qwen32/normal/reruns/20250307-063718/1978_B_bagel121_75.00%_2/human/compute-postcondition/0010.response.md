Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then no additional changes are made to `a`, `b`, `n`, or `t`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.**
