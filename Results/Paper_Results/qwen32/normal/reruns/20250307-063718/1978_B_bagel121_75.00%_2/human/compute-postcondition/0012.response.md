The code snippet assigns the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input. The conditions and calculations involving `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are not affected by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input.**
