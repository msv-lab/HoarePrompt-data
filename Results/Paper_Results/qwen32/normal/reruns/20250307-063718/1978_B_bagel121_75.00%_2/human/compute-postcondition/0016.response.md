The code snippet calculates the value of `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `k` are already defined in the initial state. The value of `b` and `ans` are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer value read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
