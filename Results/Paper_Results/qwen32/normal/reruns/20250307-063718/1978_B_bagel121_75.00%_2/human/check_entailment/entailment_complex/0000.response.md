### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` and the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun with the promotion).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a` since the promotion does not offer a better deal.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the code calculates the optimal `k`:
     - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n` because:
       - `b - a + 1` is the number of different prices available under the promotion.
       - `n` is the number of buns available.
     - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k` calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b-k+1` which represents the total price of the first `k` buns sold at the promotional price.
     - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.

3. **Output:**
   - The total profit for each test case is printed.

#### Verification Against the Example:
The code correctly handles the given examples:
- For `n=4`, `a=4`, `b=5`, it calculates `k=1` and the profit as `5 + 4*3 = 17`.
- For `n=5`, `a=5`, `b=9`, it calculates `k=5` and the profit as `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.
- For `n=10`, `a=10`, `b=5`, it calculates `k=0` and the profit as `10*10 = 100`.
- For `n=5`, `a=5`, `b=11`, it calculates `k=5` and the profit as `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.
- For `n=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1000000000`, it calculates `k=0` and the profit as `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
- For `n=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1`, it calculates `k=0` and the profit as `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
- For `n=1000`, `a=1`, `b=1000`, it calculates `k=1000` and the profit as `1000 + 999 + ... + 1 = 500500`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions and examples.

### Correctness:
