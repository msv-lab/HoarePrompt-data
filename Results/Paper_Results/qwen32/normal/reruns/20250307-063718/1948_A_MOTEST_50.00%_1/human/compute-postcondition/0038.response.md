The provided code snippet is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reassigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`)

Since `n` is reassigned, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The new value of `n` is whatever integer is input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1**.
