The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` takes the character at index `x` from the string `s` and appends it twice to the string `ans`.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50
- `n` is an input integer not equal to 1 and `n` is odd (and at least 5)
- `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `ans` is 'AAA'
- `x` is 1

The character at index `x` (which is 1) in the string `s` is 'B'. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` evaluates to 'BB'. This is then appended to `ans`, which was initially 'AAA'. As a result, `ans` becomes 'AAABB'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1 and `n` is odd (and at least 5), `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABB', `x` is 1**.
