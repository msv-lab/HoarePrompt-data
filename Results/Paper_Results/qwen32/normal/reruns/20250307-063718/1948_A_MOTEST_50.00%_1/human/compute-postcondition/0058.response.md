Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AAABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by appending two characters from the string `s` at index `x`. Since `x` is 2, the character at index 2 in `s` is 'C'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AAABBCC'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
