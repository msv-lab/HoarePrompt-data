The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `x` is 3, after the operation `x += 1`, `x` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `n` is odd (and at least 9), `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 4, `j` is 4**.
