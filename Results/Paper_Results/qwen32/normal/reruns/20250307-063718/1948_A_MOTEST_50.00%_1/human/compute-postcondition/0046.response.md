The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` from the string `s` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `x` is 1. Therefore, `s[x]` is 'B'. The code will append 'BB' to `ans`, which is initially 'AA'. Thus, `ans` becomes 'AABB'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
