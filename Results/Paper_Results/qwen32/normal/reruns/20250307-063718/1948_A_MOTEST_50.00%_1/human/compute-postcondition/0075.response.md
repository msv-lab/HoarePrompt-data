The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `x` is 0, so after the operation, `x` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` must be at least 2, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 1.
