The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` is 'D'. Therefore, 'DD' is appended to `ans`, which was initially 'AAABBCC'. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 2**.
