### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special. A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n == 1`, it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters. Hence, it prints "NO".

3. **Constructing the String for `n > 1`:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by taking pairs of different uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 6`, it could produce a string like "AABBCC", which has exactly 6 special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" and then adds pairs of different uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 3`, it could produce a string like "AAABB", which has exactly 3 special characters.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for valid cases (`n > 1`).

### Verification Against Example:

- **Test Case 1 (`n = 6`):**
  - Expected Output: "YES" followed by a string with 6 special characters, e.g., "AAABAACC".
  - Program Output: "YES" followed by "AABBCC" (which is valid).

- **Test Case 2 (`n = 1`):**
  - Expected Output: "NO".
  - Program Output: "NO" (which is correct).

- **Test Case 3 (`n = 2`):**
  - Expected Output: "YES" followed by a string with 2 special characters, e.g., "MM".
  - Program Output: "YES" followed by "AA" (which is valid, as "AA" has 2 special characters).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and constructs valid strings for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
