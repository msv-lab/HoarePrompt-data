Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1 and `n` is odd (and at least 5), `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABB', `x` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
