The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends to the string `ans` the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `x` is 1 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` is 'B'. Therefore, 'BB' is appended to `ans`, making `ans` now 'AABB'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an even integer not equal to 1 and must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**.
