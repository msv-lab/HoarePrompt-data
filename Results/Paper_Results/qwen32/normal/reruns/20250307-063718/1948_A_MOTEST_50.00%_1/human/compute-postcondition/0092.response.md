The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` is 'D'. Therefore, 'DD' is appended to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 'AAABBCCDD'.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than 8, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 3**.
