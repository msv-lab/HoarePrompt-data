The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given `x` is 3 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the character at index 3 is 'D'. Thus, 'DD' is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `n` is odd (and at least 9), `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 4**.
