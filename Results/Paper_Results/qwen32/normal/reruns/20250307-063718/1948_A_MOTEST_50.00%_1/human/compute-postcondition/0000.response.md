The provided code snippet only contains a call to `os.system('cls')`, which is used to clear the console screen in Windows. This operation does not affect any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values.

Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
