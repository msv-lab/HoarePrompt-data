The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `x` is 2, after the operation `x += 1`, the value of `x` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` must be at least 4, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 3, `j` is 1**.
