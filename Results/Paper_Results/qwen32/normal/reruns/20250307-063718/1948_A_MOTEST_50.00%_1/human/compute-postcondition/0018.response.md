The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters from the string `s` to the string `ans`. Specifically, it appends the character at index `x` of `s` repeated twice. Given that `x` is 2, the character at index 2 of `s` is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is appended to `ans`.

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an even integer not equal to 1 and must be at least 6, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 2, `j` is 2

After execution, `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an even integer not equal to 1 and must be at least 6, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**
