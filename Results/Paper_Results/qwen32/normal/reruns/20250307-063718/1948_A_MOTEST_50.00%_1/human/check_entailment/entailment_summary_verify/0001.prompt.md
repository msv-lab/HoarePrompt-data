You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to construct a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters. If `n` is 1, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs and outputs a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters, starting from 'AA', 'BB', etc., and outputs 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters.
2. There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string.
3. A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. For each test case, if it's not possible to construct such a string, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case for n = 1:**
   - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have exactly one special character and prints "NO" for `n = 1`.

3. **String Construction for n > 1:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of different uppercase letters (e.g., "AA", "BB", "CC", ...). This ensures that each repeated pair contributes two special characters, resulting in a total of `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" to create three special characters and then proceeds similarly as in the even case, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for valid cases.
   - It correctly prints "NO" for the case when `n = 1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **n = 1:** The program correctly handles this edge case by printing "NO".
- **n = 2:** The program correctly prints "YES" followed by a string with exactly 2 special characters, like "AABB".
- **n = 50:** The program correctly handles this upper bound by constructing a string with 50 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases. It constructs the required string efficiently and prints the correct output based on the problem requirements.
