The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `ans` with an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `i`. The output state will reflect this initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is a new input integer, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is an empty string.**
