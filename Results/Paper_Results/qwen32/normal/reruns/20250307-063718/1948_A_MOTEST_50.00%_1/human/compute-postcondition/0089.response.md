The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters to `ans`. Given that `x` is 2 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` is 'C'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AAABBCC'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AAABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**.
