The code `ans += s[x] * 2` takes the character at index `x` from the string `s` and appends it twice to the string `ans`. Given that `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `x` is 1, the character at index 1 is 'B'. Therefore, 'BB' is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` must be at least 7, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 4**.
