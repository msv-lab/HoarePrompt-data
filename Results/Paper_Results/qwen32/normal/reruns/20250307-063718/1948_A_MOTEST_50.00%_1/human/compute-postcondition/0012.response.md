The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` takes the character at index `x` from the string `s` and appends it twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 0, the character at index 0 in `s` is 'A'. Thus, 'AA' is appended to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 'AA'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an even integer not equal to 1 and must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0, `j` is 0**.
