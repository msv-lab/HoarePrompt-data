To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the conditions and values provided in the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `i` is 3.
- If `n` is even, `ans` is 'AABBCCDD' and `x` is 4.
- If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDDEE' and `x` is 5.

### Analysis:
The value of `ans` depends on whether `n` is even or odd:
- If `n` is even, `ans` is set to 'AABBCCDD'.
- If `n` is odd, `ans` is set to 'AAABBCCDDEE'.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine whether `n` is even or odd. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print either 'AABBCCDD' or 'AAABBCCDDEE', depending on whether `n` is even or odd.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'AABBCCDD' if n is even and 'AAABBCCDDEE' if n is odd)**
