The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the character at index 2 is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is appended to `ans`.

Initial `ans` is 'AAABB', so after appending 'CC', `ans` becomes 'AAABBBCC'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `n` is odd (and at least 9), `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABBBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 3**.
