Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, no further changes occur. Otherwise, if `n` was even, `n` is set to 6, `ans` is set to 'AABBCC', and `x` is set to 3. If `n` was odd, `n` is set to an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `ans` is set to 'AAABBCCDDEE', and `x` is set to 5.**
