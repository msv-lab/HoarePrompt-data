Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters.
2. There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string.
3. A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. For each test case, if it's not possible to construct such a string, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case for n = 1:**
   - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have exactly one special character and prints "NO" for `n = 1`.

3. **String Construction for n > 1:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of different uppercase letters (e.g., "AA", "BB", "CC", ...). This ensures that each repeated pair contributes two special characters, resulting in a total of `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" to create three special characters and then proceeds similarly as in the even case, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for valid cases.
   - It correctly prints "NO" for the case when `n = 1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **n = 1:** The program correctly handles this edge case by printing "NO".
- **n = 2:** The program correctly prints "YES" followed by a string with exactly 2 special characters, like "AABB".
- **n = 50:** The program correctly handles this upper bound by constructing a string with 50 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases. It constructs the required string efficiently and prints the correct output based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
