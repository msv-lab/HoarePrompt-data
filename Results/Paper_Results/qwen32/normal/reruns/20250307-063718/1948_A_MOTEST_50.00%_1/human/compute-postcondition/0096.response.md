Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
   - `i` is 3.
   - Depending on whether `n` is even or odd:
     - If `n` is even:
       - `ans` is 'AABBCCDD'
       - `x` is 4
     - If `n` is odd:
       - `ans` is 'AAABBCCDDEE'
       - `x` is 5

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `ans`, and `x` are defined based on the initial state, but they are not used in the given `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be 'YES', regardless of the values of the other variables.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
