Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, and `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` pairs of characters from `s`, and `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd and at least 9, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', and `x` is 4.**
