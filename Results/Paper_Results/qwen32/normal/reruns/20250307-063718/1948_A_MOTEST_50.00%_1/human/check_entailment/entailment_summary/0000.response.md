### Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Let's break down the logic and the provided execution summary:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs 'NO'. This is because it's impossible to have exactly one special character with a string of length 1.

3. **String Construction for `n > 1`**:
    - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 6`, the output could be 'AABBCC', which has 6 special characters.
    - If `n` is odd, the program starts with 'AAA' and then repeats pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 5`, the output could be 'AAABB', which has 5 special characters.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs 'YES' followed by the constructed string if `n > 1`.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 1` by outputting 'NO'.
- For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters:
  - When `n` is even, the pattern 'AABBCC...' ensures that every character except the first and last in each pair is a special character, resulting in `n` special characters.
  - When `n` is odd, starting with 'AAA' ensures that the first character is a special character, and then the pattern 'BBCC...' ensures that every character except the first and last in each pair is a special character, resulting in `n` special characters.

The execution summary aligns with the program's logic and confirms that the program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
