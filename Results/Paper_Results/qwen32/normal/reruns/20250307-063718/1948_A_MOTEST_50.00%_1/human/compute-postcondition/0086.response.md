The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters from the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `x` is 1, `s[x]` refers to the character 'B'. Thus, `s[x] * 2` results in 'BB'. This is then concatenated to `ans`, which initially is 'AAA'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AAABB'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AAABB', `x` is 1**.
