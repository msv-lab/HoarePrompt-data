The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to construct a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters. If `n` is 1, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs and outputs a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters, starting from 'AA', 'BB', etc., and outputs 'YES' followed by the constructed string.
