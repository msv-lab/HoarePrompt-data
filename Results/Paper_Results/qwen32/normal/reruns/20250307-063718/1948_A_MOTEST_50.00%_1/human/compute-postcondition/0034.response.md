Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
2. `n` is an input integer not equal to 1.
3. `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
4. Depending on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` pairs of characters from `s`, and `x` is `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is odd and at least 9, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', and `x` is 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `ans`, and `x` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a static string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
