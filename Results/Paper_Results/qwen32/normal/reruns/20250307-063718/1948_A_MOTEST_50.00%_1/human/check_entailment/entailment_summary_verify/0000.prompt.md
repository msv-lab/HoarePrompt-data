You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to construct a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters. If `n` is 1, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs and outputs a string of length `n` using pairs of distinct uppercase letters, starting from 'AA', 'BB', etc., and outputs 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `n == 1`. According to the problem description, if there is no suitable string, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation incorrectly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing "NO", which is correct, but the logic for constructing the string for other values of `n` is flawed.

The main issue is that the program does not ensure that exactly `n` characters are special. For example:

- For `n = 2`, the program outputs `YES` followed by `AA`, which is incorrect because there are no special characters in the string `AA`.
- For `n = 3`, the program outputs `YES` followed by `AAA`, which is incorrect because there are no special characters in the string `AAA`.
- For `n = 5`, the program outputs `YES` followed by `AAABBB`, which is incorrect because there are only 2 special characters in the string `AAABBB`.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            # Start with 'AAA' to ensure at least 2 special characters
            ans += 'AAA'
            x += 1
            # Add pairs of characters to ensure we have exactly n special characters
            special_count = 2
            while special_count < n:
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
                special_count += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program ensures that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters by starting with `AAA` and then adding pairs of characters until the desired number of special characters is reached.
