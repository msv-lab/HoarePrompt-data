The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2 and `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` is 'C'. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'CC'. This is then appended to `ans`, which was initially 'AABB'. The new value of `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` must be at least 9, `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 5**.
