### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program to ensure it correctly determines the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent.

1. **Total Points Check**: 
   - The sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw). If the total is odd, it implies an impossible scenario, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` can be achieved by the player who won all games against the other two players, and the remaining points (`p1 + p2`) can only come from draws between the other two players.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The variables `x` and `y` are used to track the points deducted from `p1` and `p2` respectively to match the points of `p3`. The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the points deducted from `p1` and `p2` are valid (i.e., non-negative and do not exceed the original scores). If a valid combination is found, it prints the total number of draws (`p1 - x + p3`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are impossible (e.g., `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`), resulting in `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.
