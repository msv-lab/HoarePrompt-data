Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; `y` is at least `x` minus 1; `x` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` is now at least one less than the value of `x`, while all other conditions remain the same.
