Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program correctly outputs `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (each game awards an even number of points).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - **Case 1:** If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program outputs `p1 + p2`. This is correct because in this scenario, the highest-scoring player could have won all games against the other two players, and the remaining points could be draws between the other two players. The maximum number of draws is the total points of the other two players.
   - **Case 2:** If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop iterates with `x` and `y` such that `x` is the number of points `p1` has from wins against `p2` and `y` is the number of points `p3` has from wins against `p2`. The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the points `p1` and `p2` have from wins against each other are consistent. If this condition is met, the number of draws is `p1 - x + p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games are played (`0 0 0`) correctly by outputting `0`.
   - The program handles cases where it's impossible to achieve the given scores (`1 1 1`, `1 1 10`) by outputting `-1`.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles all described scenarios and edge cases. It checks for the validity of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws appropriately.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
