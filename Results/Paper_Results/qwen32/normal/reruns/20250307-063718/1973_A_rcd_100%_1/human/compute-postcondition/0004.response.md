The initial state provides some information about the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but it does not affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement. The `print(-1)` statement simply outputs the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
2. It also tells us that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, but this information is not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print(-1)` statement will be:
Output: **-1**
