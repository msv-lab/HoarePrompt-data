Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is equal to `x - 1` if the condition was not met initially. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds, the loop or if statement is exited without further changes to `x` and `y`.**
