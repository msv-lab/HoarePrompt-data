Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, `x` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.**
