The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `x` is increased by 1.
