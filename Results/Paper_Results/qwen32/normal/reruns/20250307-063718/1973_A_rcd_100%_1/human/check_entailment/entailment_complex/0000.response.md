### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

2. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is even. If it is not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).

3. **Determine Maximum Draws**:
   - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the program outputs \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the maximum number of draws that can occur is limited by the sum of the scores of the two lower-scoring players, as the highest-scoring player \( p_3 \) could have only drawn with the other two players.
   - Otherwise, the program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) where:
     - \( x \) is the number of games won by the player with score \( p_1 \).
     - \( y \) is the number of games won by the player with score \( p_3 \).
     - The condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) ensures that the remaining points for \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are consistent with the number of games won by \( p_3 \).
     - The program calculates the maximum possible number of draws as \( p1 - x + p3 \).
   - If no valid \( x \) and \( y \) can be found, the program defaults to printing \( p3 \).

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Sum is 0 (even). Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) holds trivially, the maximum number of draws is 0.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Sum is 2 (even). Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) holds for \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \), the maximum number of draws is 1.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Sum is 3 (odd). The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Sum is 4 (even). Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) holds for \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), the maximum number of draws is 2.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Sum is 9 (odd). The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Sum is 12 (even). Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) holds for \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), the maximum number of draws is 6.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Sum is 12 (even). Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the condition \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) holds for \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements.
