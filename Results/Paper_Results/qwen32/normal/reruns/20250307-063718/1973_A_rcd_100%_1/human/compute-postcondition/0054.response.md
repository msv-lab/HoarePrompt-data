The value of `y` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `y` is now one less than `x` (since `y` was previously greater than or equal to `x`); `x` is increased by 1.
