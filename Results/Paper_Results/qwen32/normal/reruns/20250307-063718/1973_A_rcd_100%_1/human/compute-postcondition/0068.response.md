Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the program enters the else block where the loop either breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` for some `x` and `y` within the loop, or the loop completes without breaking and prints `p3`. In all cases, `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their newly assigned values; `_` is incremented by 1.**

Since the `if` condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition, the program will always execute the `if` part and never enter the `else` part. Therefore, the postcondition reflects the state after the `if` part is executed.
