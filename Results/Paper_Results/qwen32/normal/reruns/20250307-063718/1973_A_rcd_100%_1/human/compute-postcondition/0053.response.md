The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is non-negative.
- `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

After the code is executed, the value of `x` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`; `x` is increased by 1.**
