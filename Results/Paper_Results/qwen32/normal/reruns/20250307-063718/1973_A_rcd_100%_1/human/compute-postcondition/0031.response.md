Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `y` is at least 2 greater than `x`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.**
