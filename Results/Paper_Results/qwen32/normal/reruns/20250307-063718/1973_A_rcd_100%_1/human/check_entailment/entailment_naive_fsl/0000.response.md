To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with a valid set of games.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and ensures that they are non-decreasing.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it's not, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so it prints `-1`.
   - If the sum is even, it proceeds to check the consistency of the scores.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest scorer could have won all games against the other two players, and the remaining games could have been draws.
   - Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of `x` (number of games won by the lowest scorer) and `y` (number of games won by the middle scorer) and checks if the remaining games could have been draws. If a valid configuration is found, it prints the maximum number of draws.

Let's consider some edge cases to verify the correctness of the program:

- **Case 1**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0`
  - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is `0`. The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Case 2**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - One draw (1 point each) and no wins. The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Case 3**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - This is impossible because if two players have 1 point, one of them must have won a game, giving them 2 points. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Case 4**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2`
  - Two draws and one win for the highest scorer. The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Case 5**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 3, p3 = 3`
  - This is impossible because if all three players have 3 points, they must have won 1.5 games each, which is not possible. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Case 6**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 4, p3 = 5`
  - The highest number of draws is `6` (all games could be draws). The program correctly outputs `6`.

- **Case 7**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 10`
  - This is impossible because the highest scorer could have won at most 4 games against the other two players, and the remaining games could not account for the high score of `10`. The program correctly outputs `2`.

After analyzing these cases, it seems that the program handles all edge cases correctly and produces the expected output for each scenario.

**Conclusion**:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
