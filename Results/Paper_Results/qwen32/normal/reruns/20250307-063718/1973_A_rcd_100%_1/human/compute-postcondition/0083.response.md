The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `_`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; `y` must be at least `x`; `x` is incremented by 1.**
