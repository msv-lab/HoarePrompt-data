To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State
1. `t` is greater than 1. This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis
- We need to find the value of `p1 + p2`.
- The precondition tells us that `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
- The sum of three integers is odd if and only if the number of odd integers among them is odd (i.e., 1 or 3 odd integers).

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. **All three integers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) are odd**: In this case, the sum of any two integers (e.g., `p1 + p2`) will be even, and the sum of all three (`p1 + p2 + p3`) will be odd.
2. **One of the integers is odd, and the other two are even**: In this case, the sum of the two even integers will be even, and adding the odd integer will make the total sum odd. The sum of the two even integers (e.g., `p2 + p3` if `p1` is odd) will be even, and the sum of one even and one odd integer (e.g., `p1 + p2` if `p3` is even) will be odd.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`. However, we know that the sum `p1 + p2` could be either even or odd based on the parity of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

However, since the only constraint given is that the sum of all three (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is odd, we can't definitively state whether `p1 + p2` is even or odd without additional information. But we can describe the output in terms of the given constraints.

### Conclusion
The output of `print(p1 + p2)` will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which could be any integer, but it must satisfy the condition that `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
