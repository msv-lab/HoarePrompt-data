The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its current value.

State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.**
