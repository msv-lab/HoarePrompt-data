Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: There are multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players after a series of chess games, with p_1, p_2, and p_3 being non-decreasing. The number of test cases t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the program enters the else block where the loop either breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` for some `x` and `y` within the loop, or the loop completes without breaking and prints `p3`. In all cases, `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the program enters the else block where the loop either breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` for some `x` and `y` within the loop, or the loop completes without breaking and prints `p3`. In all cases, `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their newly assigned values; `_` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
