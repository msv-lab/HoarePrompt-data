Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. The function returns a result for each test case based on the scores of the players.**
