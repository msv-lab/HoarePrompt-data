The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `y`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `y` is at least `x - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust `y` to be equal to `x`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is equal to `x`**
