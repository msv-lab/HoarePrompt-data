Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Sum Check**: It first checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each in case of a draw).

3. **Direct Case**: If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws possible is limited by the lower scores, and the highest score can absorb the rest of the points in wins.

4. **Iterative Case**: If the above condition is not met, the program uses a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws. It tries to balance the scores to see if a valid configuration of wins and draws can produce the given scores.

5. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates with `x` increasing and `y` decreasing, checking if `p1 - x <= p2 - (p3 - x)`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws possible. If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

The logic in the program seems to correctly address the requirements and constraints of the problem. It checks for the impossible condition (odd sum) and then tries to find a valid set of draws and wins that result in the given scores.

Correctness: **True**
