To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `p3` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` (though `y` and `x` are not used in the print statement, they are part of the initial state).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are defined in the initial state.
- `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement.

### Analysis:
Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only express the output in terms of `p1`, `p3`, and `x`.

The expression `p1 - x + p3` will be evaluated based on the values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x`. Given the constraints on `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we know:
- `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
- `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- `p3 >= 0`.

However, without knowing the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x`, we can't compute a numerical result. Instead, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that their sum with p2 is odd, p3 is less than p1 + p2, and p3 is greater than or equal to 0; x is an integer)**
