The `continue` statement in the given code snippet does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `_` remain as they were before the execution of the `continue` statement. The precondition that `t` is greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, still holds. The condition for entering or not entering the else block remains unchanged, and the logic for what happens inside the else block (whether the loop breaks or completes) is unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the program enters the else block where the loop either breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` for some `x` and `y` within the loop, or the loop completes without breaking and prints `p3`. In all cases, `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their newly assigned values; `_` is incremented by 1.**
