The value of `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
