Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `y` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is decreased by 1 and `x` is increased by 1.**
