The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` must be non-negative; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.
