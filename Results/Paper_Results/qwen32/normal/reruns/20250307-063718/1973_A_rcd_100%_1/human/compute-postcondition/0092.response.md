To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given conditions and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t > 1`
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with an odd sum.
   - `x = 0`
   - `y = p3`
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though `_` is not relevant to the final output state of `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - `while y >= x`

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, print `p1 - x + p3` and break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and decrement `y` by 1.

4. **Else Clause:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking, print `p3`.

### Output States:
- **After the first iteration:**
  - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop breaks, and `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

- **After the second iteration:**
  - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds at any point, the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 2 and `y` becomes `p3 - 2`.

- **After the third iteration:**
  - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds at any point, the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 3 and `y` becomes `p3 - 3`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until either `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true or `y < x`. Given that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and considering the nature of the loop, the loop will either break when `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is satisfied or will reach a point where `y < x`, causing the `else` clause to execute and print `p3`.

Since the loop condition `y >= x` will eventually fail (as `y` decreases and `x` increases), the loop will either print `p1 - x + p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, or it will print `p3` if the condition is never met.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on whether `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is ever true during the iterations. If it is never true, the loop will print `p3` and terminate. If it is true at any point, it will print `p1 - x + p3` and terminate.

Given the provided constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output state is:

**Output State: p3 is printed if the loop condition is never met, or p1 - x + p3 is printed if the loop condition is met at any point.**

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only conclude that the loop will print either `p3` or `p1 - x + p3` based on the loop condition. However, considering the general case where the loop does not necessarily break early, the most definitive final output state is when the loop condition is never met, leading to the `else` clause execution.

Output State: **p3**
