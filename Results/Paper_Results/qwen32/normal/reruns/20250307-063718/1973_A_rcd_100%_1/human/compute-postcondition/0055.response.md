Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is one less than `x` and `x` is increased by 1.**
