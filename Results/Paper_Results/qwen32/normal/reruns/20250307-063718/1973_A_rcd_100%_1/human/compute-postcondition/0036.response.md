The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides some conditions and variable definitions, but these do not influence the value being printed by the `print` statement. The value `-1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and will be output as is.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

Despite these conditions, the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
