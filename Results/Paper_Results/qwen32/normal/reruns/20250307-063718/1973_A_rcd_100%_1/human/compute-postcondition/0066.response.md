The provided code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state description does not indicate any conditions or loops that would alter the execution of this print statement. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are mentioned but do not affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement directly.

Therefore, the `print(-1)` statement will execute and print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
