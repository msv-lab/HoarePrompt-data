Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
