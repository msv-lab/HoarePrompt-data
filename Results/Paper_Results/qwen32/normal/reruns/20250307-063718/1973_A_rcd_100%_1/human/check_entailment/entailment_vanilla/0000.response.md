Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- A draw gives each player 1 point, and a win gives the winner 2 points, the loser 0 points.
- The total points must be an even number because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Even Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If it's not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points if all points come from games (each game contributes 2 points).
   - This check is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - **Case 1: `p3 >= p1 + p2`**
     - If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed as wins and losses without violating the score constraints.
   - **Case 2: `p3 < p1 + p2`**
     - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
     - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
     - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws and breaks the loop.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where the total points are odd by printing `-1`.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws in both cases (`p3 >= p1 + p2` and `p3 < p1 + p2`) seems correct based on the problem constraints.
- The loop ensures that the scores can be distributed among wins and losses without violating the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
