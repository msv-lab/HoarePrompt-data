To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `y >= x` is satisfied. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input, with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd, and `p3` being less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is equal to `p3`

The loop condition is `y >= x`. Since `x` is 0, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute. Given that `y` is equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than or equal to 0.

However, the conditions provided about `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` do not directly affect the condition `y >= x` because `x` is explicitly given as 0. The only variable we need to ensure is non-negative is `p3` (which is `y`).

Since `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it is reasonable to assume that `p3` can be non-negative (as long as `p1` and `p2` are chosen such that their sum is greater than `p3` and the total sum is odd).

Therefore, no additional constraints are needed beyond ensuring `p3` (or `y`) is non-negative, which is already satisfied by the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0**
