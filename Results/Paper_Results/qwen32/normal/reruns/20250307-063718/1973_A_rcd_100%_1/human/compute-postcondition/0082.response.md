Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; `y` must be at least `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
