The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `y` must be at least 2 greater than `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
