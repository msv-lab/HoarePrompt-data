The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores, ensuring that the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum possible value of `p1 - x + p3` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - (p3 - x)` and prints this value. If no such `x` exists, it prints `p3`.
