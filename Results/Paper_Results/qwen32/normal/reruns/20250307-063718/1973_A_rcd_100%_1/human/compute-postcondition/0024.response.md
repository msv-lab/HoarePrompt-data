Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `x` is increased by 1; `y` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is decreased by 1, while the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x` remain as specified in the initial state.
