To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 - x + p3)`, let's break down the information provided:

1. `t` is greater than 1. This variable `t` does not directly influence the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` is non-negative.
5. `y` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x`. This variable `y` also does not directly influence the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose.
6. The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.

From the information given, we know the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but we do not know the value of `x`. Therefore, we can express the output in terms of these known and unknown variables.

The expression `p1 - x + p3` will be evaluated as follows:
- `p1` is a known integer.
- `x` is an unknown integer.
- `p3` is a known non-negative integer.

Thus, the output will be a value that depends on the specific value of `x`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are known integers, and x is an unknown integer)**
