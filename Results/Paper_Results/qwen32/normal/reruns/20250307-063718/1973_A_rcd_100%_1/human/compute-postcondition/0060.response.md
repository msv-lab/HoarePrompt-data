The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `y`. The precondition that `y` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x` is still valid, but now `y` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `y` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x` and is now one less than its previous value; `x` is increased by 1.**
