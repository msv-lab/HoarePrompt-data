Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0; `_` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been set to 0, and `_` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
