Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 1; `y` is `p3` and `p3` must be non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**

Natural language: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
