Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `y` must be at least 2 greater than `x`; `x` is increased by 1; `y` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` maintain their initial properties (their sum is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is non-negative); `x` has been incremented by 1; `y` has been decremented by 1, but it still must be at least 2 greater than `x`.
