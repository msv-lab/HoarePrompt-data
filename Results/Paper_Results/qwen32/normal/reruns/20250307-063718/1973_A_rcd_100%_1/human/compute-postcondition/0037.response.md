Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
