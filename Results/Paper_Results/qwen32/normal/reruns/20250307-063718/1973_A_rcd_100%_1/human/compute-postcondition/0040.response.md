The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is greater than 1 and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd still holds true.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0.**
