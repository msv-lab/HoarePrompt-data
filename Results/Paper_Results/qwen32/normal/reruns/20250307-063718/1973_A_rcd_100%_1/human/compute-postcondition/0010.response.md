Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 0.**

The variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their initial values and conditions. The variable `x` is initialized to 0.
