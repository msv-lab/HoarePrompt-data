You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players after a series of chess games, with p_1, p_2, and p_3 being non-decreasing. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each set of input values `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the program has printed the appropriate result based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores, ensuring that the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum possible value of `p1 - x + p3` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - (p3 - x)` and prints this value. If no such `x` exists, it prints `p3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with a valid set of games.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and ensures that they are non-decreasing.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it's not, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so it prints `-1`.
   - If the sum is even, it proceeds to check the consistency of the scores.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest scorer could have won all games against the other two players, and the remaining games could have been draws.
   - Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of `x` (number of games won by the lowest scorer) and `y` (number of games won by the middle scorer) and checks if the remaining games could have been draws. If a valid configuration is found, it prints the maximum number of draws.

Let's consider some edge cases to verify the correctness of the program:

- **Case 1**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0`
  - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is `0`. The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Case 2**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - One draw (1 point each) and no wins. The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Case 3**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - This is impossible because if two players have 1 point, one of them must have won a game, giving them 2 points. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Case 4**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2`
  - Two draws and one win for the highest scorer. The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Case 5**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 3, p3 = 3`
  - This is impossible because if all three players have 3 points, they must have won 1.5 games each, which is not possible. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Case 6**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 4, p3 = 5`
  - The highest number of draws is `6` (all games could be draws). The program correctly outputs `6`.

- **Case 7**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 10`
  - This is impossible because the highest scorer could have won at most 4 games against the other two players, and the remaining games could not account for the high score of `10`. The program correctly outputs `2`.

After analyzing these cases, it seems that the program handles all edge cases correctly and produces the expected output for each scenario.

**Conclusion**:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
