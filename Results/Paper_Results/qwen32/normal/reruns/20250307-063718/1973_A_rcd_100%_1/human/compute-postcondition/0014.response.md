Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input such that:
   - Their sum is odd.
   - `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
3. `x` is 0.
4. `y` is equal to `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0.
5. `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `x` is 0.
- Therefore, `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
- The print statement then becomes `print(p1 + p3)`.

### Explanation:
- `p1` and `p3` are integers provided as input.
- The condition `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `y` is set to `p3` and `p3` is non-negative.
- The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` simplifies to `p1 <= p2 - p3` because `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

### Output:
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, p3 < p1 + p2, and p1 <= p2 - p3)**
