Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players after a series of chess games, with p_1, p_2, and p_3 being non-decreasing. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
