Let's carefully evaluate the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the solution. We will validate the logic used in the code and verify if it aligns with the problem description.

### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. This is correct because the total points awarded in each game (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw) must always be even.
2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest scorer could have won all games against the other two players, and the remaining games could have been draws.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of `x` (number of games won by the lowest scorer) and `y` (number of games won by the middle scorer) and checks if the remaining games could have been draws.

### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it outputs `-1`.

2. **Case 1: `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - The program correctly outputs `p1 + p2` because the highest scorer could have won all games against the other two players, and the remaining games could have been draws.

3. **Case 2: `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. Let's analyze the logic:
     - `x` is the number of games won by the lowest scorer.
     - `y` is the number of games won by the middle scorer.
     - The loop iterates while `y >= x` and checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it outputs `p1 - x + p3`.
     - The loop ensures that the number of games won by the lowest scorer does not exceed the number of games won by the middle scorer.
     - If no valid configuration is found, it outputs `p3`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0`
  - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is `0`. The program correctly outputs `0`.
- **Case 2**: `p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - One draw (1 point each) and no wins. The program correctly outputs `1`.
- **Case 3**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
  - This is impossible because if two players have 1 point, one of them must have won a game, giving them 2 points. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Case 4**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2`
  - Two draws and one win for the highest scorer. The program correctly outputs `2`.
- **Case 5**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 3, p3 = 3`
  - This is impossible because if all three players have 3 points, they must have won 1.5 games each, which is not possible. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Case 6**: `p1 = 3, p2 = 4, p3 = 5`
  - The highest number of draws is `6` (all games could be draws). The program correctly outputs `6`.
- **Case 7**: `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 10`
  - This is impossible because the highest scorer could have won at most 4 games against the other two players, and the remaining games could not account for the high score of `10`. The program correctly outputs `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for each scenario. The logic used in the code aligns with the problem description.

**Final Evaluation**:
Final: **True**
