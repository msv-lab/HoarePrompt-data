Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (this value is not directly used in the print statement).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is non-negative.
   - `x` is initialized to 0.
   - `y` is initialized to `p3`.
   - The current value of `_` is incremented by 1 (this value is not directly used in the print statement).
   - `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Since `x` is 0, `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
   - Therefore, the expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Thus, based on the given initial state and the print statement, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
