To determine the output of the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values and constraints of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that:
   - Their sum is odd.
   - `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `p3` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. `y` must be at least 2 greater than `x`.

### Analysis:
- We are given that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers that satisfy certain conditions, but their exact values are not specified.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is constrained to be less than `p1 + p2` and at least 0.
- The variable `x` is mentioned in the print statement but is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, we can't determine its exact value based on the provided information.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.
- `p1` and `p3` are integers with specific constraints.
- `x` is an undefined variable in the provided context.

### Conclusion:
Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, and thus we cannot compute the exact numerical output of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

### Output Description:
The output will be the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`, where `p1` and `p3` are integers satisfying the given conditions, and `x` is an undefined variable.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers satisfying the given conditions, and x is an undefined variable)**
