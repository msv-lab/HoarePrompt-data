The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` is initially equal to `p3`, after the operation, `y` will be `p3 - 1`.

The conditions provided in the initial state remain valid except for the updated value of `y`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input such that their sum is odd and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3 - 1` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
