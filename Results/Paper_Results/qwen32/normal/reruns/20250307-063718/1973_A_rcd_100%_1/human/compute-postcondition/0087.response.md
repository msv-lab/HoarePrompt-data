To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State and Conditions:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is non-negative.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is set to `x`.

2. **Key Points to Determine:**
   - The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not explicitly given, but their sum is odd and `p3` is non-negative.
   - The variables `x` and `y` are not initialized in the given snippet but are manipulated in the condition and loop.
   - The `print` statement outputs `p1 - x + p3`.

3. **Behavior of the Loop:**
   - The loop continues to increment `x` and set `y = x` until the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is satisfied.
   - Since `y` is always set to `x`, the condition simplifies to `p1 - x <= p2 - x`, which further simplifies to `p1 <= p2`. This means the loop will terminate as soon as `x` is such that `p1 - x <= p2 - x` is true.

4. **Determining `x`:**
   - If `p1 <= p2`, the loop will not run at all, and `x` will be 0 (assuming it was initialized to 0 before the loop).
   - If `p1 > p2`, `x` will increment until `p1 - x <= p2 - x` becomes true, which will happen when `x` is at least `p1 - p2`.

5. **Final Value of `x`:**
   - The value of `x` at the point of the `print` statement depends on the initial values of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p1 <= p2`, `x` will be 0.
   - If `p1 > p2`, `x` will be at least `p1 - p2`.

6. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output will be `p1 - x + p3`.
   - If `p1 <= p2`, `x` is 0, so the output is `p1 + p3`.
   - If `p1 > p2`, `x` is at least `p1 - p2`, so the output is `p1 - (p1 - p2) + p3` which simplifies to `p2 + p3`.

Given the conditions, we cannot determine the exact values of `p1` and `p2`, but we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output:**
- If `p1 <= p2`, the output is `p1 + p3`.
- If `p1 > p2`, the output is `p2 + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we describe the output based on these conditions.

Output: **p1 + p3 (if p1 <= p2) or p2 + p3 (if p1 > p2)**
