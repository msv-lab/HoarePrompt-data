The code reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, which is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will include the new values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input.**
