The provided code snippet only reads an integer input which represents the number of test cases, `t`. It does not affect the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, or `p_3` since they are not mentioned or modified in the given code. The precondition about the scores of the players and the range of `t` remains valid.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players after a series of chess games, with p_1, p_2, and p_3 being non-decreasing. The number of test cases t is an input integer.**
