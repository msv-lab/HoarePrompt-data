Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 1.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are three integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not enter the else block.
5. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters the else block, where a loop either breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3` or completes without breaking and prints `p3`.
6. `_` is incremented by 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Print Statement:
```
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly outputs the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The values of `p1` and `p2` are part of the initial state and are not modified by the subsequent logic described (i.e., the else block and the loop).
- The precondition does not specify the exact values of `p1` and `p2`, but it does specify that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This provides a constraint on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`. While we do not have the exact values of `p1` and `p2`, we know that their sum, along with `p3`, results in an odd number.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
