In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
