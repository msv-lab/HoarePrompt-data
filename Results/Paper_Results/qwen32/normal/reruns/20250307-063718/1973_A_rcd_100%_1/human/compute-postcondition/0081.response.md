To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (this value is not directly used in the print statement, so it's not relevant here).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is non-negative.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it's not relevant here).
   - `y` must be at least `x` (this condition is not directly used in the print statement, so it's not relevant here).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
- `p3` is non-negative.
- The sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

However, the variables `x` and `p2` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `x` is not given a value, we can't determine its exact numerical value. Therefore, the output will depend on the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x` at runtime.

To provide the most precise description possible, we can express the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers, p3 is non-negative, and x is an integer)**
