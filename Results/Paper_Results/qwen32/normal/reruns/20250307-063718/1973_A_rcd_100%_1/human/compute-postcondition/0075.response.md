Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`; the current value of `_` is incremented by 1; `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, `y`, and the condition involving `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
