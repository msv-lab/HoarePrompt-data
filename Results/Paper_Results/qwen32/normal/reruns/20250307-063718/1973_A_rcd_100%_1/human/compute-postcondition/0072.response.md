To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition `y >= x`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is greater than 1 (This variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need adjustment)
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input (These variables are not part of the loop condition and do not need adjustment)
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd (This is a condition on the input values, but it does not affect the loop condition directly)
- `x` is 0
- `y` is `p3`
- `_` is incremented by 1 (This variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need adjustment)

The loop condition is `y >= x`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`, the condition `y >= x` simplifies to `p3 >= 0`. Since `p3` is an integer read from the input, we need to ensure that `p3` is non-negative for the loop to execute.

However, the problem statement does not specify any constraints on the input values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` other than their sum being odd. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop condition is met is `p3`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `p3` is non-negative.

State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0; `y` is `p3` and `p3` must be non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1**
