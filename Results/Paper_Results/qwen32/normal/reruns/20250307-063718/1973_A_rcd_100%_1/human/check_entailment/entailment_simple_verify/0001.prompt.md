You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- A draw gives each player 1 point, and a win gives the winner 2 points, the loser 0 points.
- The total points must be an even number because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Even Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If it's not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points if all points come from games (each game contributes 2 points).
   - This check is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - **Case 1: `p3 >= p1 + p2`**
     - If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed as wins and losses without violating the score constraints.
   - **Case 2: `p3 < p1 + p2`**
     - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
     - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
     - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws and breaks the loop.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where the total points are odd by printing `-1`.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws in both cases (`p3 >= p1 + p2` and `p3 < p1 + p2`) seems correct based on the problem constraints.
- The loop ensures that the scores can be distributed among wins and losses without violating the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
