The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This code does not perform any calculations or conditional checks that would change the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` beyond assigning `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` their new values. The preconditions about `t` being greater than 1 and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd remain valid as they are not affected by this code. The condition regarding `p3` being greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2` is also not evaluated or changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
