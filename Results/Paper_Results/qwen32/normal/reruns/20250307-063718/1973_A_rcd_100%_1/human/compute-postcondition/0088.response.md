The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `_`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is non-negative; `_` is incremented by 1; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is equal to `x`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
