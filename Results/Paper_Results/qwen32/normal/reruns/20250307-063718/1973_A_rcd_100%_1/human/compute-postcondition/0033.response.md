Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.**
