Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the three integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3 - 1` and `p3` must be non-negative; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` has been decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 1`. All other conditions remain the same.
