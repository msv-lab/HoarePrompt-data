To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum number of tents required based on the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals as described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate these participants).
   - If the sum is at least 3, it calculates the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which should give the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate both extroverts and universals while respecting the constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of tents for introverts (which is simply the number of introverts since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.

Let's consider the example test cases provided:

- **First test case (1 2 3)**:
  - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
  - Extroverts are 2, which is not a multiple of 3. The sum of extroverts and universals is 5, which is greater than 3, so it's possible to accommodate them.
  - The number of tents for extroverts and universals is `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
  - Total tents needed: 1 (for introverts) + 2 = 3.
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Second test case (1 4 1)**:
  - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
  - Extroverts are 4, which is not a multiple of 3. The sum of extroverts and universals is 5, which is greater than 3, so it's possible to accommodate them.
  - The number of tents for extroverts and universals is `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
  - Total tents needed: 1 (for introverts) + 2 = 3.
  - However, the problem states that it's impossible to accommodate the participants in this case. This suggests that the logic in `func_1` might be incorrect for this specific scenario.
  - The correct approach should be to try to form groups of 3 with extroverts and universals, and if there are leftover extroverts that can't form a group of 3, it should be impossible.
  - For 4 extroverts and 1 universal, we can form 1 group of 3 (2 extroverts + 1 universal), but we will have 2 extroverts left, and they can't form a group of 3, so it's indeed impossible.

Upon further inspection, the current logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where leftover extroverts can't form a group of 3 after forming as many groups of 3 as possible with universals. The program should check if after forming groups of 3 with universals, the remaining extroverts can form complete groups of 3.

Thus, the provided program is not correct for all scenarios.

**Correctness: False**
