Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts to form groups of three. Let's analyze the code and identify the issue:

The function `func_1` attempts to determine how many tents are needed for the extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and if the remaining extroverts plus universals are less than 3. If this condition is met, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form the required groups. Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding up.

However, the function `func_2` simply returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`, which is correct. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` itself.

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
1 2 0
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Explanation of the expected output: There is 1 introvert and 2 extroverts. Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, but there are no universals available to form these groups. Therefore, it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and the output should be `-1`.

However, the provided code will output `1` for this input because `func_1` will return `1` (since `(2 + 0) / 3` rounded up is `1`), and `func_2` will return `1 + 1 = 2` for the introverts and the calculated tents, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not handle the case where there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts to form groups of three, and it incorrectly calculates the number of tents needed in such scenarios.
