### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert wants to share a tent with two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any tent configuration.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to satisfy all preferences, or return `-1` if it's impossible.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- It then calls `func_2` which calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- The logic is:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, then we need to check if we can use universals to fill the remaining spots.
  - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we can't form a complete group of 3 for the remaining extroverts, hence it returns `None` (impossible to accommodate).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed by summing up extroverts and universals and then dividing by 3 (using `ceil` to round up).

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
- It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the participants, so it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` (since each introvert needs a separate tent) and returns the sum.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1**: `a=1, b=2, c=3`
  - `func_1(2, 3)` calculates the number of tents for extroverts and universals.
    - `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 3 >= 3`, so it returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
  - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

- **Test Case 2**: `a=1, b=4, c=1`
  - `func_1(4, 1)` calculates the number of tents for extroverts and universals.
    - `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`, so it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

These examples match the expected output, indicating the program seems to work correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the given problem constraints and examples.

**Correctness: True**
