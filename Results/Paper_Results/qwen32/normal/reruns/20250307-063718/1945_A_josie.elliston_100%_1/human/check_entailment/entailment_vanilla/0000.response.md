Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants with specific preferences:
- Introverts (a) must be in tents by themselves.
- Extroverts (b) must be in tents with exactly two others.
- Universals (c) can be in tents with either one or two others.

If it's impossible to satisfy all participants' preferences, we should return -1.

### Solution Analysis

The solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It ensures that extroverts are always in tents with exactly two others, and any remaining extroverts are paired with universals if possible.
- `func_2`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent by themselves) to the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:
1. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to fill up a tent. If not, it returns `None`.
2. If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, or if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals, it calculates the total number of tents needed using the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

### Verification with Example Cases

Let's verify the solution with the provided example cases:

1. **Input:** `1 2 3`
   - Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 2 (1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal, and 1 tent for 2 universals). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 = 3.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

2. **Input:** `1 4 1`
   - Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts cannot be completely paired with 1 universal. Total tents: -1.
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1 4 2`
   - Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2 (1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal, and 1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 = 3.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

4. **Input:** `1 1 1`
   - Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert cannot be completely paired with 1 universal. Total tents: -1.
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

5. **Input:** `1 3 2`
   - Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 1 (1 tent for 3 extroverts). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 = 2.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

6. **Input:** `19 7 18`
   - Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 8 (2 tents for 6 extroverts + 12 universals, and 1 tent for 1 extrovert + 2 universals). Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 8 = 27.
   - Output: 28 (Correct)

7. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0. Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 0 = 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

8. **Input:** `7 0 0`
   - Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0. Total tents: 7 (introverts) + 0 = 7.
   - Output: 7 (Correct)

9. **Input:** `0 24 0`
   - Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(24, 0)` returns 8 (8 tents for 24 extroverts). Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 8 = 8.
   - Output: 8 (Correct)

10. **Input:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 666666667 (333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333333 tents for 1000000000 universals). Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 = 1666666667.
    - Output: 1666666667 (Correct)
