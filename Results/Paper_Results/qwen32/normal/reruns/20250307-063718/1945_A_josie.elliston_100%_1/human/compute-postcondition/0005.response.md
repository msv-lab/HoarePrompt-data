Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. Given the conditions, this value is at least 2.**

Explanation: Since `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 is either 1 or 2. Adding `universals` to this remainder results in a sum of 3 or more. Therefore, the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` is at least 3 more than a multiple of 3, ensuring that the ceiling of their division by 3 is at least 2.
