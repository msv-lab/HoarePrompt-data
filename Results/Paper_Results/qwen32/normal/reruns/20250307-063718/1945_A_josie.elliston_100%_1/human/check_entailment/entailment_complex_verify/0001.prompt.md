You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

test_case_n = int(input())
for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or more.
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or more.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. Given the conditions, this value is at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 plus `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which is at least 2.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if `ret` is None else it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It computes a value based on `extroverts` and `universals` using `func_1`. If the computed value is `None`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the computed value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants with specific preferences:
- Introverts (a) must be in tents by themselves.
- Extroverts (b) must be in tents with exactly two others.
- Universals (c) can be in tents with either one or two others.

If it's impossible to satisfy all participants' preferences, we should return -1.

### Solution Analysis

The solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It ensures that extroverts are always in tents with exactly two others, and any remaining extroverts are paired with universals if possible.
- `func_2`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent by themselves) to the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:
1. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to fill up a tent. If not, it returns `None`.
2. If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, or if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals, it calculates the total number of tents needed using the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

### Verification with Example Cases

Let's verify the solution with the provided example cases:

1. **Input:** `1 2 3`
   - Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 2 (1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal, and 1 tent for 2 universals). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 = 3.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

2. **Input:** `1 4 1`
   - Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts cannot be completely paired with 1 universal. Total tents: -1.
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1 4 2`
   - Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2 (1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal, and 1 tent for 2 extroverts + 1 universal). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 = 3.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

4. **Input:** `1 1 1`
   - Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert cannot be completely paired with 1 universal. Total tents: -1.
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

5. **Input:** `1 3 2`
   - Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 1 (1 tent for 3 extroverts). Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 = 2.
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

6. **Input:** `19 7 18`
   - Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 8 (2 tents for 6 extroverts + 12 universals, and 1 tent for 1 extrovert + 2 universals). Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 8 = 27.
   - Output: 28 (Correct)

7. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0. Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 0 = 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

8. **Input:** `7 0 0`
   - Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0. Total tents: 7 (introverts) + 0 = 7.
   - Output: 7 (Correct)

9. **Input:** `0 24 0`
   - Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(24, 0)` returns 8 (8 tents for 24 extroverts). Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 8 = 8.
   - Output: 8 (Correct)

10. **Input:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 666666667 (333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333333 tents for 1000000000 universals). Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 = 1666666667.
    - Output: 1666666667 (Correct)
