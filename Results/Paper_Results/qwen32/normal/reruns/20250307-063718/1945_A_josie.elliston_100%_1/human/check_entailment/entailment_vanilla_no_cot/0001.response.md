Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert requires a tent for themselves. Thus, `a` tents are needed for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others, meaning each tent can accommodate exactly 3 people (one extrovert and two others).
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any configuration (single tent, tent with one other person, or tent with two others).

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy all preferences, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can fill a tent together.
   - If it's impossible to form a valid tent, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **`func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Introverts**:
   - The number of tents required for introverts is simply `a` (the number of introverts).

2. **Handling Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if extroverts can be paired with universals to form valid tents.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can fill a tent together.
   - If it's impossible, it returns `None`, which is correctly handled by `func_2` to return `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles cases where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`), resulting in `0` tents.
   - It also correctly handles cases where it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, returning `-1`.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the preferences of all participants are respected.

Correctness: **True**
