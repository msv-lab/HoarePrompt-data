Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is the second input integer; `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is sorted in ascending order; `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = []` sets `ans2` to an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
