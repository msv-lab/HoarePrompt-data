The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `b[2]` is appended to `ans1`.

The initial state specifies that `ans1` already contains:
- The last element of `b` twice.
- The `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.
- `b[2]`.

Since `i` is 2, appending `b[2]` again means `ans1` will now contain:
- The last element of `b` twice.
- The `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.
- `b[2]` (first occurrence).
- `b[2]` (second occurrence).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `c`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, the `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and `b[2]` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and if `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
