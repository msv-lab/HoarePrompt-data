Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5. If `b[5]` is equal to `b[4]`, then `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it twice and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[5]` is not equal to `b[4]` and `b[5]` is not equal to `b[6]`, then `l` has an additional element `b[5]` appended to it. No other changes occur to `n`, `i`, `k`, or `l` unless specified.**
