Output State: **`ans1` contains all sorted elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by all elements of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with all elements of `l` appended to it; `k` is the input integer; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`.**

The code snippet sorts the list `c`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `c` is now sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
