The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains `c[i]` and `c[i]` (the new element appended), `k` is equal to `req`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `c[i] == c[i - 1]`.**
