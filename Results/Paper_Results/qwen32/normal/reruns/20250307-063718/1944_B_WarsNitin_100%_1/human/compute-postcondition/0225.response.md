The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the `i`th element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. The value of `ans1` changes based on whether `k` is 0 or not, but this condition does not affect the operation of appending `b[i]` to `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans1` is a list containing either the `n-1`th element of `b` twice (if `k` is 0) or the `i`th element of `b` (if `k` is not 0).
- `ans2` is an empty list.
- `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and also contains `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`.
- `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is sorted in ascending order.
- `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
- `req` is twice the second input integer.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.
- If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing `ans1.append(b[i])`, the `ans1` list will now include the `i`th element of `b` as an additional element.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice plus the `i`th element of `b` if `k` is 0, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing the `i`th element of `b` twice; `ans2` is an empty list; `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and also contains `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is sorted in ascending order; `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `req` is twice the second input integer; `n` is at least 2; `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.**
