The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. The other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `k` is initially `k - 2`. After executing `k -= 1`, the new value of `k` becomes `(k - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - 3`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`, the element at index `i` of `l`, and now also the element at index `i` of `l` again; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 3`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 2. The element at index 2 of `l` has been appended to `ans2`.**
