Postcondition: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, or `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` repeated twice if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is either 0, `req`, -2, or `req - 2` depending on the condition, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, and `n` is greater than 1.**
