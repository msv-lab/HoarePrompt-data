Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing `c[i]` and the previous elements of `ans2`, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions. `q` is incremented by the number of iterations. `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1.**
