The code appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `b[n - 1]` is the largest element in `b`. Since `ans1` initially contains the last element of `b`, appending `b[n - 1]` again means `ans1` will now contain the largest element of `b` twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list. `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
