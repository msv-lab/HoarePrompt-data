The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, we need to account for the changes to `ans1` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice
- `ans2` is an empty list
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`
- `q` is `q + 1`
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`
- `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`
- `req` is `2 * k`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged
- `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true for the current value of `i`

After executing `ans1.append(b[i])`, `ans1` will have `b[i]` appended to it. If `ans1` was initially empty, it will now contain one element. If `ans1` initially contained two elements (the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice), it will now contain three elements.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `ans1` is a list containing the elements it originally had with `b[i]` appended; `ans2` is an empty list; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`; `q` is `q + 1`; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`; `req` is `2 * k`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged; `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true for the current value of `i`.**
