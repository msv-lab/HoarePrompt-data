Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations, `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed, and `i` is 0.**
