The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. 

Given the initial state, `ans2` either contains elements from `c` based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` or it remains empty. After executing `ans2.append(c[i])`, `ans2` will have an additional element `c[i]` appended to it. 

The values of other variables (`ans1`, `b`, `c`, `k`, `l`, `q`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains `c[i]` and `c[i]` (the new element appended), and `k` is equal to `req - 2`. Otherwise, `ans2` is `[c[i]]`. `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
