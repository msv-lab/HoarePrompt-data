Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b` is now the first `n` elements of the list `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
