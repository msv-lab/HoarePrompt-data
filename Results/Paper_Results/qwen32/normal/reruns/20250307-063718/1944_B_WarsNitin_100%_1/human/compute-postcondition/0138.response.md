The code appends `b[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 4, `b[4]` is added as the new last element of `ans1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about `k` does not affect this particular operation as it does not involve any branching or looping based on `k` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is in `ans1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 4, `ans1` includes `b[4]` as its new last element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes to `n` or `i` are made.**
