Output State: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` is modified by adding `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2.**

In natural language: The value of `ans2` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` from list `c`. The values of `ans1`, `l`, `q`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
