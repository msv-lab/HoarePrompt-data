Output State: **`ans1` contains the first 3 elements of `l`; `ans2` contains the first 3 elements of `l`; `k` is the second input integer; `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is newly introduced and contains a list of integers that were input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
