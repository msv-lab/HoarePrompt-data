Postcondition: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met and the loop was broken out of, otherwise `k` retains its value, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element, and `i` is 0.**
