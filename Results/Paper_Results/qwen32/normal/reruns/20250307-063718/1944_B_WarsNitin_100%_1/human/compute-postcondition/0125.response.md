Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`, `req` is `2 * k`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true for the current value of `i`.**
