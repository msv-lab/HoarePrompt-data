Postcondition: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0. `k` is 0, indicating that it has been decremented enough times. `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.**
