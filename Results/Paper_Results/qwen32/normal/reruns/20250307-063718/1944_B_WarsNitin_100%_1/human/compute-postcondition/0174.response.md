The provided code snippet appends `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. No other variables are affected by this operation, and the conditions for `ans1`, `l`, `q`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains `c[i]` three times, and `k` is equal to `req - 4`. Otherwise, `ans2` contains `c[i]` and `c[i]` (the new element appended), and `k` is equal to `req - 2`. `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is 3. `ans2` now includes `c[3]` and `c[3]`.**
