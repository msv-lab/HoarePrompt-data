Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, or `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` repeated twice if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is either 0, `req`, -2, or `req - 2` depending on the condition, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `l`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
