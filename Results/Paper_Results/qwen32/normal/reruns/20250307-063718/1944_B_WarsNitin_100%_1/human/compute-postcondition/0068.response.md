The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`.

Given the initial state, `ans2` is either an empty list or contains elements repeated twice if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, the element `c[2]` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]` appended to it, `k` is either 0, `req`, -2, or `req - 2` depending on the condition, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, `ans2` now includes the element at index 2 of list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
