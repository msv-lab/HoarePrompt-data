The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 1`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 0.**
