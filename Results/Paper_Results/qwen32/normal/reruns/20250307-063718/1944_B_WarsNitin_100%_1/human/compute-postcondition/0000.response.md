`t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ ⌊`n`/2⌋; `a` is a list of 2`n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.**
