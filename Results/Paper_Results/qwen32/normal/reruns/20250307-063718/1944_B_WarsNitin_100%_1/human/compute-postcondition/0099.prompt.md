Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations, and `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 1`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`, and then the element at index `i` of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 2`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`, the element at index `i` of `l`, and now also the element at index `i` of `l` again; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 3`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 2. The element at index 2 of `l` has been appended to `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
