Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` is modified if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` by adding `c[i]` and decreasing `k` by 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
