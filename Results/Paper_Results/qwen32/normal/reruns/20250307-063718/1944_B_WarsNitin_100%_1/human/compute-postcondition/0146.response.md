The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The condition regarding `k` does not impact this specific line of code, so it is not relevant to the output state.

Since `i` is 5, the element at index 5 of list `b` is appended to `ans1`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 6 and `i` is 5. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5, `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it**.
