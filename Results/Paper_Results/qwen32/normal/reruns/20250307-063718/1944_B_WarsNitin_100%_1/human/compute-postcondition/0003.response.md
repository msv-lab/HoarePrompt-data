The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `a`. This means that the previous list `a` is replaced with the new list of integers read from the input.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `a` is now a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
- `q` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0.**
