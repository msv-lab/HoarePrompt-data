Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list. If `k` is 0, then `req` is 2 and `l` is a list containing the largest element of `b` if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `l` is an empty list. If `k` is not 0, then `req` is either `k` or `k` + 2, and `l` is determined based on the conditions specified in the precondition. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**
