The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the next iteration, `i` should be 5. The value of `n` must be greater than 6 to ensure that `i` (which will be 5) is still within the range (1, n-1).

State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 5**
