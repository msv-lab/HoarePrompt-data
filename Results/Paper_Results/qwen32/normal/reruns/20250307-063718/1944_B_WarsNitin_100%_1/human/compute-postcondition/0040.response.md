The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input.
- `q` is 0.
- `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice or an empty list with the `i`-th element of `b` appended.
- `ans2` is an empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing `ans1.append(b[i])`:
- The list `ans1` will have the `i`-th element of `b` appended to it.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, `ans2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input; `q` is 0; `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order; `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order; `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice or an empty list with the `i`-th element of `b` appended, and now includes the `i`-th element of `b` appended again; `ans2` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
