Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` is modified by adding `c[i]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, and `k` is decreased by 2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
