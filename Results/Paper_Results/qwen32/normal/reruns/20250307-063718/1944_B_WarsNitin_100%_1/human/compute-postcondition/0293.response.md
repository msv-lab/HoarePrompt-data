The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, the element `l[2]` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, and now includes `l[i]` and `l[2]`; `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations and now includes `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions; `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed; `k` is decremented by 1; `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

In simpler terms, `ans2` now includes `l[2]` in addition to the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
