Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. The variables `ans1` and `ans2` are updated as specified based on the conditions provided.
