To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, we need to carefully follow the initial state provided:

1. **`ans1` and `ans2`**: Both `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized to contain the first three elements of the list `l`.
2. **`k`**: `k` is initialized to 0.
3. **`l`**: `l` is constructed from the list `b` under the conditions:
   - `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`
   - `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`
4. **`q`**: `q` is incremented each time `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.

Since the specific elements of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the content of `l` and `ans1` in terms of the conditions given.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- `l` is built by iterating through `b` and selecting elements that are not equal to their immediate neighbors.
- `ans1` (and `ans2`) is then assigned the first three elements of this filtered list `l`.

### Output Description:
- Since `l` is constructed from `b` based on the specified conditions, we cannot determine the exact values of `ans1` without knowing the specific elements of `b`.
- However, we can describe `ans1` as the first three elements of `l`, where `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions given.

### Final Output:
Output: **the first three elements of `l` (where `l` is a list containing unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`)**
