The code snippet `req = k` assigns the value of `k` to the variable `req`. None of the other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the addition of the new variable `req`.

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is twice the second input integer; `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is sorted in ascending order; `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `req` is twice the second input integer.**
