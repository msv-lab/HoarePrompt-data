Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, with the `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `k` is decremented by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` is a list with the element `b[i]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
