Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]` appended to it twice, `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, or `req - 4` depending on the initial value of `k`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `k` is -2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so if `k` was initially 0, it becomes -2. If `k` was initially `req`, it becomes `req - 2`. If `k` was initially -2, it becomes -4. If `k` was initially `req - 2`, it becomes `req - 4`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
