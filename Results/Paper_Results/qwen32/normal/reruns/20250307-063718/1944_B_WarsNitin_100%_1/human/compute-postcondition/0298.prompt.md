Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ ⌊`n`/2⌋; `a` is a list of 2`n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by all elements of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with all elements of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - len(l)`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` contains the first 3 elements of `l`; `ans2` contains the first 3 elements of `l`; `k` is 0; `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `ans1` and `ans2` will contain the first `min(len(l), k_initial)` elements of `l`, where `k_initial` is the initial value of `k`.
   - `q` will be incremented by `min(len(l), k_initial)`.
   - `k` will be `max(k_initial - len(l), 0)`.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above logic, the final output state can be described as:

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
