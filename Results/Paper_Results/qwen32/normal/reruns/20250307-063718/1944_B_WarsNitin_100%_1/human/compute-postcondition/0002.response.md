The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` have certain constraints, but these constraints are not directly relevant to the execution of the provided code snippet, which only updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice, `q` is 0**.
