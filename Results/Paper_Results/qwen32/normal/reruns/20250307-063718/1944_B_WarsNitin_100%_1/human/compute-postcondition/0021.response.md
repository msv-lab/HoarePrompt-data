Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k` + 2. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list. `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been decreased by 2, and `req` now holds the original value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
