The code snippet `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the last element of the sorted list `b` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `l` is either an empty list or contains the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`. After appending `b[n - 1]` to `l`, `l` will have one more element.

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is `2 * k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and `l` now also contains `b[n - 1]`; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`; `req` is `2 * k`.**

In simpler terms, the list `l` now includes the last element of the sorted list `b`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
