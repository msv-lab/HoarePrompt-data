To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(*ans2)`, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how `ans2` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans1` Construction:**
   - `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by all elements of `l`.
   - For example, if `b = [1, 2, 3]` and `l = [4, 5]`, then `ans1` would be `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **`ans2` Construction:**
   - `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with all elements of `l` appended to it.
   - For example, if `c = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` and `l = [4, 5]`, then `ans2` would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **`k` Adjustment:**
   - `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `l` from it.
   - This adjustment does not affect the construction of `ans2`.

4. **`l` Construction:**
   - `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements.
   - For example, if `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `l` would be `[2, 4]` (assuming we take every second element excluding the smallest and largest).

### Detailed Steps for `ans2` Construction:
1. **Process `c`:**
   - Traverse through `c` and repeat each element twice if it is equal to the previous element.
   - For example, if `c = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, the processed part of `ans2` would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.

2. **Append `l`:**
   - Append all elements of `l` to the end of the processed `c` list.
   - For example, if `l = [4, 5]`, `ans2` would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans2)` statement will print all elements of `ans2` separated by spaces. Given the construction rules, `ans2` will consist of elements from `c` with repeated elements as specified, followed by all elements of `l`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given initial state and the construction rules for `ans2`, the output will be a sequence of elements from `c` with repeated elements as specified, followed by all elements of `l`.

Output: **elements from `c` with repeated elements as specified, followed by all elements of `l` (where `c` is a list where consecutive equal elements are repeated twice, and `l` is a list of non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements)**
