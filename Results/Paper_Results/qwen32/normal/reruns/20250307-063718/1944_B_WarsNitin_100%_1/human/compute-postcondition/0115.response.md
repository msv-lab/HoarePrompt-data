Postcondition: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is `2 * k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`; `req` is `2 * k`.**
