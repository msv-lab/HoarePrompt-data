The code snippet `k = req` assigns the value of `req` to `k`. Therefore, the value of `k` is updated to the value of `req`. The other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `q`, and any other variables) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains empty, `k` is equal to `req`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.**
