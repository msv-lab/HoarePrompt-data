Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k`, `l` is an empty list. Additionally, `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`.**
