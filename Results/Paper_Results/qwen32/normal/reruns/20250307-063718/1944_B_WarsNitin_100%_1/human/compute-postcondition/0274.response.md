Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes `c[3]` and `c[3]`, and `k` is decreased by 2; otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions. `q` is incremented by the number of iterations. `n` is at least 4. `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
