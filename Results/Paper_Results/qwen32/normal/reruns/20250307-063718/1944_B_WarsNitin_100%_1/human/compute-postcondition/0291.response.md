Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, and now includes `l[i]`; `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations and now includes `l[0]` and `l[1]`; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions; `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed; `k` is decremented by 1; `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering the condition `k == 0` and the described outcomes for both the if and else parts.
