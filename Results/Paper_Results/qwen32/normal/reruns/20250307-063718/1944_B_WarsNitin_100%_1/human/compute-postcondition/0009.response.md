The given Python code snippet is:
```
ans2 = []
```

This line of code initializes a new empty list named `ans2`. The existing variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**
