The code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 5, `b[i]` is `b[5]`. Since `ans1` already has the element `b[5]` appended to it, appending `b[5]` again means `ans1` will now have `b[5]` twice.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5, `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it twice.**
