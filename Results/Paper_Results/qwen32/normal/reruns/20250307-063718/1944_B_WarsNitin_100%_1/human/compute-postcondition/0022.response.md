Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is either twice the second integer read from the input or twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k` + 2. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is updated to contain the largest element of `b`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2, `ans1` contains the last element of `b` twice, and `req` is increased by 2.**
