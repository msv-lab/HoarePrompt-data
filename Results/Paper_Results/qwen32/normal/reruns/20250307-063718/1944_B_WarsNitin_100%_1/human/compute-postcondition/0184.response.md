Output State: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` plus the element `l[i]`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0, plus `l[i]`; `k` is -1; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, making it -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
