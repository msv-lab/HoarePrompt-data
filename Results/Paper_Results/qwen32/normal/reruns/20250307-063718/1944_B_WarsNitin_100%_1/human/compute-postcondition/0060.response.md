Postcondition: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is either 0 or `req`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, and `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the state of `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
