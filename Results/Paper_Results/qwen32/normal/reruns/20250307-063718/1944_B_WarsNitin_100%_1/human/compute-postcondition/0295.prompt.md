Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed, and `k` is decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, and now includes `l[i]`; `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations and now includes `l[0]`; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions; `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed; `k` is decremented by 1; `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, and now includes `l[i]`; `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations and now includes `l[0]` and `l[1]`; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions; `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed; `k` is decremented by 1; `i` is 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, and now includes `l[i]` and `l[2]`; `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations and now includes `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions; `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed; `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now `k-1`; `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
