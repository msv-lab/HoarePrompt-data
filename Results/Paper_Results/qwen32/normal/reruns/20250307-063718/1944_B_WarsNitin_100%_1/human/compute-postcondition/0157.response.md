Postcondition: **`ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains empty, `k` is equal to `req`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
