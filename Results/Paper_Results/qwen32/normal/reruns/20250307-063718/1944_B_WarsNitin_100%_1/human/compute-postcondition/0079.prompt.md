Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `req`, and `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, or `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` repeated twice if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is either 0, `req`, -2, or `req - 2` depending on the condition, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, and `n` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]` appended to it twice, and `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, or `req - 4` depending on the initial value of `k`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains an empty list. `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `k` is -2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is either empty or contains `c[2]` appended twice, `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, `req - 4`, -6, or `req - 6`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `c[3]` is appended twice to `ans2` and `k` is adjusted by subtracting 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
