The code snippet `k -= 2` decreases the value of `k` by 2. Given that `k` is either 0 or `req`, after the operation:

- If `k` was 0, it becomes -2.
- If `k` was `req`, it becomes `req - 2`.

The other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is a list containing the element `c[i]` repeated twice, `k` is either -2 or `req - 2`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, and `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**
