The code snippet assigns the value of `k` to `req`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the value of `req` is now the same as `k`, which was initially `2 * k`.

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is `2 * k`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`; `req` is `2 * k`.**
