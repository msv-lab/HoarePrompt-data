The code snippet sorts the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` will be in non-decreasing order after the execution of the code. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a`.**
