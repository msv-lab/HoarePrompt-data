#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.

    #State: `ans1` and `ans2` will contain elements selected from `b` and `c` as per the rules, with the first `min(len(l), k_initial)` elements of `l` added to both lists for each iteration. `k` will reflect the state at the end of the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It then constructs and prints two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` based on specific rules involving the values of `k` and the contents of `a`.
