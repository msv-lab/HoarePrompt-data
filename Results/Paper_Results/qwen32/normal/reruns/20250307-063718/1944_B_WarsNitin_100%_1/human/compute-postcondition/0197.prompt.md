Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0. `k` is 0 if it was decremented enough times, otherwise it will be the remaining value after the loop exits. `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` plus the element `l[i]`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0, plus `l[i]`; `k` is -1; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` plus the element `l[i]`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0, plus `l[i]`; `k` is -2; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs; `i` is 0; `ans1` now includes `l[0]` at the end; `ans2` now includes `l[0]` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are repeated based on the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` plus the element `l[i]`, and now includes `l[1]` at the end; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` until `k` reaches 0, plus `l[i]`; `k` is -3; `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`; `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs; `i` is 1; `ans2` now includes `l[0]` and `l[1]` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
