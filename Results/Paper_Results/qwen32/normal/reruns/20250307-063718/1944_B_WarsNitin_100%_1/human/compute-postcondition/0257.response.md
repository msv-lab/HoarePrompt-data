The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` was an empty list. After appending `c[i]` to `ans2`, `ans2` will now contain the value of `c[i]`.

The other variables (`ans1`, `l`, `q`, `n`, `i`, and `c[i]`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` is a list containing `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.**
