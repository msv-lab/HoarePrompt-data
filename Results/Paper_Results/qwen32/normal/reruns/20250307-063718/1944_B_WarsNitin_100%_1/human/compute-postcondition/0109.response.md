The code snippet provided is:

```
ans1 = []
```

This line of code reassigns `ans1` to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with all elements of `l` appended to it; `k` is the input integer; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`.**
