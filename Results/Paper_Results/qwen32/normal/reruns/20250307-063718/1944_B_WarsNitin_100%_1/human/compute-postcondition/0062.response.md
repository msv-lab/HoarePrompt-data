The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` initially contains only the element `c[i]`. After appending `c[i]` again, `ans2` will contain two identical elements, both equal to `c[i]`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is a list containing the element `c[i]` repeated twice, `k` is either 0 or `req`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, and `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the state of `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
