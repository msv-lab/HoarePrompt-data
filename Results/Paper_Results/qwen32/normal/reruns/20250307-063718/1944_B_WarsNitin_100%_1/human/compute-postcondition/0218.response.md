Postcondition: **`ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice. `ans2` is an empty list in both cases. `k` is twice the second input integer if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `k` is twice the second input integer minus 2. `l` is a list that contains the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and also contains `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`. `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is sorted in ascending order. `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order. `req` is twice the second input integer.**
