Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice. `ans2` is an empty list in both cases. `k` is `2 * k` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `k` is `2 * k - 2`. `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`. `q` is `q + 1` in both cases. `n` is the input integer. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input. `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`. `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`. `req` is `2 * k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 2. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` contains the elements it originally had with `b[i]` appended twice, and `k` is `k - 2`. Otherwise, if `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice. In both cases, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, with `b[i]` appended to it if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `q` is incremented by 1 if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`, and `req` is `2 * k`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 4. If `b[4]` is equal to `b[3]`, then `ans1` includes `b[4]` as its new last element and `k` is `k - 2`. If `b[4]` is not equal to `b[3]` and `b[4]` is not equal to `b[5]`, then `l` has `b[4]` appended to it. If `k` is 0 in any of these cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes to `n` or `i` are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5. If `b[5]` is equal to `b[4]`, then `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it twice and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[5]` is not equal to `b[4]` and `b[5]` is not equal to `b[6]`, then `l` has an additional element `b[5]` appended to it. No other changes occur to `n`, `i`, `k`, or `l` unless specified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
