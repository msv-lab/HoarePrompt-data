Postcondition: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]` appended to it twice, and `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, or `req - 4` depending on the initial value of `k`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains an empty list. `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `k` is -2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
