Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 4. If `b[4]` is equal to `b[3]`, then `ans1` includes `b[4]` as its new last element and `k` is `k - 2`. If `b[4]` is not equal to `b[3]` and `b[4]` is not equal to `b[5]`, then `l` has `b[4]` appended to it. If `k` is 0 in any of these cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes to `n` or `i` are made.**
