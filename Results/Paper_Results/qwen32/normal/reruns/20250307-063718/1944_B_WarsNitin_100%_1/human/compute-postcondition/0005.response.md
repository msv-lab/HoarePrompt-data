The code snippet `c = a[n:]` creates a new list `c` that contains the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of `2n` integers, and `b` is the first `n` integers of `a`. Therefore, `c` will be the second half of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a`, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a`.**
