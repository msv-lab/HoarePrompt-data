The list `l` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]` to it. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `k` does not affect this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 4, `l` has `b[4]` appended to it, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes to `n` or `i` are made.**
