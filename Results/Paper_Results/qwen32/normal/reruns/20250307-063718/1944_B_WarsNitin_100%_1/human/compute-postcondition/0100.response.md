To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`ans1` Construction:**
   - `ans1` is constructed by first taking all consecutive elements from `b` and repeating them twice.
   - Then, all elements of `l` are appended to `ans1`.

2. **`ans2` Construction:**
   - `ans2` is constructed by taking elements from `c` and repeating each element twice if it is equal to the previous element.
   - Then, all elements of `l` are appended to `ans2`.

3. **`k` Modification:**
   - `k` is modified to be `k - len(l)`.

4. **`l` Construction:**
   - `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b`, except for the smallest and largest elements.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(*ans1)
```
This will print all elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

### Detailed Construction of `ans1`

1. **Consecutive Elements of `b` Repeated Twice:**
   - Let's assume `b` is a list of elements, say `[b1, b2, b3, ..., bn]`.
   - Consecutive elements of `b` repeated twice would be: `[b1, b1, b2, b2, b3, b3, ..., bn, bn]`.

2. **Appending `l` to the Above:**
   - `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b`, except for the smallest and largest elements.
   - Let's assume `l` is `[l1, l2, ..., lm]`.

3. **Combining Both Parts:**
   - `ans1` will be: `[b1, b1, b2, b2, b3, b3, ..., bn, bn, l1, l2, ..., lm]`.

### Example to Illustrate
Let's consider an example to illustrate the construction of `ans1`.

**Example:**
- Assume `b = [4, 7, 10, 3, 6]`.
- The smallest element in `b` is `3` and the largest is `10`.
- Non-consecutive elements from `b` (excluding `3` and `10`) could be `[4, 6]` (if we consider every other element starting from the first).
- Therefore, `l = [4, 6]`.
- Consecutive elements of `b` repeated twice: `[4, 4, 7, 7, 10, 10, 3, 3, 6, 6]`.
- Appending `l` to the above: `[4, 4, 7, 7, 10, 10, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4, 6]`.
- So, `ans1 = [4, 4, 7, 7, 10, 10, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4, 6]`.

### Output
Given the construction of `ans1` as described, the print statement will output all elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

Output: **b1, b1, b2, b2, b3, b3, ..., bn, bn, l1, l2, ..., lm (where b1, b2, ..., bn are consecutive elements of b repeated twice, and l1, l2, ..., lm are non-consecutive elements of b except the smallest and largest elements)**

If we use the example values:
Output: **4, 4, 7, 7, 10, 10, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4, 6**
