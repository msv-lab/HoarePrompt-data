The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5, and `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it twice. The variable `k` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can only infer that its value is reduced by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 5, `ans1` has the element `b[5]` appended to it twice, `k` is decreased by 2.**
