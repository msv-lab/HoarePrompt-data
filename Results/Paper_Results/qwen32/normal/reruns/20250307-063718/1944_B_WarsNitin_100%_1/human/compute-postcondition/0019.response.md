The code snippet appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. The value of `b[n - 1]` is the largest element in the sorted list `b` because `b` is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains twice the second integer read from the input.
- `a` remains a list of 2`n` integers read from the input.
- `q` remains 0.
- `b` remains the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `c` remains the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `ans1` now contains the last element of `b`.
- `ans2` remains an empty list.
- `req` remains `k`.
- If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` remains a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.
- `b[n - 2]` remains equal to `b[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list. `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
