Postcondition: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` contains all consecutive pairs of elements from `c` that were found during the iterations, `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations that the loop executed, `k` is decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found, and `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
