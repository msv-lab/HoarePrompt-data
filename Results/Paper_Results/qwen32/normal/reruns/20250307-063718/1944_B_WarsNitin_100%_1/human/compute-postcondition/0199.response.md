To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `ans1` contains the first 3 elements of `l`.
- `ans2` contains the first 3 elements of `l`.
- `k` is 0.
- `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`.
- `q` is incremented based on the number of times `b[i] != b[i + 1]` occurs.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*ans2)
```

Let's break down the relevant information:
- `ans1` and `ans2` both contain the first 3 elements of `l`.
- `l` is derived from `b` with elements selected based on the conditions that the element is not equal to its adjacent elements in `b`.

Since `ans2` contains the first 3 elements of `l`, the output will be these first 3 elements of `l`. However, we don't have the exact values of `b`, so we can't determine the exact numerical values of these elements. But we can describe them based on the given conditions.

The output will be the first 3 elements of `l`, which are derived from `b` with the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the output can be described as the first 3 unique elements from `b` that do not match their adjacent elements.

Output: **the first 3 elements of `l` (where `l` contains unique elements from `b` based on the conditions `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`)**
