Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is either empty or contains `c[2]` appended twice, `c[3]` appended once, and now `c[3]` appended again, `k` is either -4, `req - 4`, -6, or `req - 6`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been decreased by 2, so if it was originally -2, it is now -4; if it was `req - 2`, it is now `req - 4`; if it was -4, it is now -6; and if it was `req - 4`, it is now `req - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
