Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` contains the elements it originally had with `b[i]` appended twice, and `k` is `k - 2`. Otherwise, if `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` twice. In both cases, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, with `b[i]` appended to it if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `q` is incremented by 1 if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`, and `req` is `2 * k`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged.**
