Postcondition: **`k` is 0, indicating that `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`. `ans1` is a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice. `ans2` is an empty list. `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, and also contains `b[n - 1]`. `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is sorted in ascending order. `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order. `req` is twice the second input integer. `n` is at least 2.**
