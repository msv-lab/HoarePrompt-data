You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It then constructs and prints two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` based on specific rules involving the values of `k` and the contents of `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2` for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

The code attempts to construct two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` by sorting the first and second halves of the input array `a`, and then selecting pairs of identical elements from each half. However, the logic for ensuring the XOR equality is flawed. The code does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `ans1` will match the XOR of the selected elements in `ans2`.

Here is a specific test case where the program will fail:

### Test Case
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

### Expected Output
The output should be two arrays `l` and `r` of length 2 such that their bitwise XOR is equal. One valid output could be:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or
```
3 4
3 4
```
or any other valid combination.

### Actual Output
The program might output something like:
```
1
1 2 3 4
```
or
```
1 2
1
```
which does not satisfy the condition that the XOR of `ans1` equals the XOR of `ans2`.

### Why the Code Fails
The code does not properly balance the selection of elements between `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure that their XOR values are equal. The logic for selecting elements and ensuring the XOR equality is not robust enough to handle all cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness False.
