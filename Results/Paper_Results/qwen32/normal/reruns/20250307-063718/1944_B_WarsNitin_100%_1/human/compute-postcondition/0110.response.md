Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is the input integer; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements; `q` is `q + 1`; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is the sorted first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is the sorted elements of `a[n:]`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `ans2` is reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
