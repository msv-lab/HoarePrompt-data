The code snippet `k = req` assigns the value of `req` to `k`. This means that the previous value of `k` (which was reduced by 2 for each consecutive pair found in `b`) is replaced by the value of `req`. The other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `req`, and `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements.**
