Postcondition: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is either empty or contains `c[2]` appended twice, `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, `req - 4`, -6, or `req - 6`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `c[3]` is appended twice to `ans2` and `k` is adjusted by subtracting 2.**
