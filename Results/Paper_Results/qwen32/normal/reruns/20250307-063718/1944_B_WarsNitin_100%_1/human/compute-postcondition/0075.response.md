The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` from list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is either empty or contains `c[2]` appended twice, `c[3]` appended once, `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, or `req - 4`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms: `ans2` now includes `c[2]` twice and `c[3]` once. All other variables remain unchanged.
