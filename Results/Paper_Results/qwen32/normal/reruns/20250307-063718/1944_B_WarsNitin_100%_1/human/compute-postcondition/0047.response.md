Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, with the `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and if `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
