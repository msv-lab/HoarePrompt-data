Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is either twice the second integer read from the input or twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k` + 2. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer in `b`. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is updated to contain the largest element of `b`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2, `ans1` contains the last element of `b` twice, and `req` is increased by 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[i]` four times, `ans2` is an empty list, and `k` is decreased by 2 (or set to -2 if `k` was 0). If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is the previous `l` with `b[i]` appended to it. `req` and `l` are determined based on the conditions specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, with the `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `k` is decremented by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` is a list with the element `b[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, with the `i`-th element of `b` appended again if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` also contains `b[2]` twice. `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[2]`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `k` is `k - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
