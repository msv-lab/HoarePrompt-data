The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the sorted list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` either contains the last element of `b` twice or is an empty list, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans1` will now contain one additional element, which is `b[i]`.
- `i` is already incremented, so it reflects the index of the element just appended to `ans1`.

Given that `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, and `i` is an index that starts from 0 and is incremented, `b[i]` will be the element at index `i` in this sorted list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2`n` integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is the first `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `c` is the second `n` integers of the list `a` sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice or an empty list with the `i`-th element of `b` appended, `ans2` is an empty list, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
