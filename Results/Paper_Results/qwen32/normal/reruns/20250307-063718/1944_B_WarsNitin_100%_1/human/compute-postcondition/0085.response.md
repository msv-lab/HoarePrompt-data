Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` appended to it; `k` is 0 if the if condition was met and the loop was broken out of, otherwise `k` retains its value; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 0.**

In simple terms, the first element of `l` has been added to the end of `ans2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
