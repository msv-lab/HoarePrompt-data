The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of `l` to `ans2`. Since `i` is given as 2, the element at index 2 of `l` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, followed by the first element of `l`, the element at index `i` of `l`, and now also the element at index `i` of `l` again; `ans2` contains elements from `c` that are repeated twice if they are equal to the previous element, with the first element of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` appended to it; `k` is `k - 2`; `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements and must have at least one element; `i` is 2. The element at index 2 of `l` has been appended to `ans2`.**
