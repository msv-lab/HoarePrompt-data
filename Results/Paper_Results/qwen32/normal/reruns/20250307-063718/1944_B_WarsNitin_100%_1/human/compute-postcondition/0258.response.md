The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop ended, `ans2` is a list containing `c[i]` and the previous elements of `ans2`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` and the first and last elements under certain conditions, `q` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.**
