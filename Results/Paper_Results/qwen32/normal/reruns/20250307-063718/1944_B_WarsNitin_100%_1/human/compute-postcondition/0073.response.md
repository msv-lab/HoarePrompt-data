Output State: **`ans1` contains all consecutive elements from `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is either empty or contains `c[2]` appended twice, `k` is either -2, `req - 2`, -4, or `req - 4`, `l` contains non-consecutive elements from `b` except the smallest and largest elements, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `l`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
