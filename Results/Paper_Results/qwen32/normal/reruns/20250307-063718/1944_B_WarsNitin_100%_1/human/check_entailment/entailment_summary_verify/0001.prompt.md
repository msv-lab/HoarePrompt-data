You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It then constructs and prints two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` based on specific rules involving the values of `k` and the contents of `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.
- We need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, such that:
  - `l` is a subset of `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`
  - `r` is a subset of `[a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}]`
  - The bitwise XOR of all elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of all elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a`.
- It splits `a` into two halves: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).
- It sorts both `b` and `c`.
- It initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists to store elements of `l` and `r` respectively.
- It sets `k` to `2 * k` because we need `2k` elements in each subset.
- It tries to find unique elements in `b` and add them to a temporary list `l` if they appear only once.
- It then iterates through `b` and `c` to add pairs of equal elements to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively.
- It attempts to fill the remaining slots in `ans1` and `ans2` with elements from `l` to ensure both arrays have `2k` elements.
- Finally, it prints `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Elements**: The program tries to handle unique elements in `b` but does not correctly ensure that the XOR condition is met.
2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Filling of `ans1` and `ans2`**: The program does not guarantee that the final `ans1` and `ans2` will have the same XOR value, and it does not handle the case where `k` is not fully filled with pairs of equal elements.
3. **Lack of General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution that guarantees the existence of `l` and `r` with the required properties.

### Correct Solution Approach:
- A correct approach would involve a more systematic way to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. One possible strategy is to use a greedy approach to pair elements and ensure the XOR condition is met.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
