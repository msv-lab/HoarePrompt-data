The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It then constructs and prints two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` based on specific rules involving the values of `k` and the contents of `a`.
