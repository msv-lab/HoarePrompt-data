The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the variable `maxx`. Given that `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the current value of `maxx`, the new value of `maxx` will be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` contains the value `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
