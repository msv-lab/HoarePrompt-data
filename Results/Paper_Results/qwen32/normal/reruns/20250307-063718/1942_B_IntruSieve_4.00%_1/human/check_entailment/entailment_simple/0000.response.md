### Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to process each test case.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which is used to track the maximum value in `mex`.

2. **Processing Each Element of `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again to ensure `minn` is the smallest unused integer.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Positive `arr[i]`**: When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly appends the smallest unused integer (`minn`) to `mex` and increments `minn` to ensure it remains the smallest unused integer.
- **Non-positive `arr[i]`**: When `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program calculates the required value based on the formula `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. This calculation ensures that the constructed `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic described, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` for each test case. The program also handles the edge cases, such as when `arr[i]` is non-positive, by correctly calculating the required values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
