The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. However, for the loop to start executing, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not specified, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function when the loop begins.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
