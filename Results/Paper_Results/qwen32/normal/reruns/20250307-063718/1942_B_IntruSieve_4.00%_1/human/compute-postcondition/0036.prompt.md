Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` includes `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[0] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn` as its last element, and `minn` is increased by 1. If `minn` was equal to `maxx` before the if statement, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as its last element, and `minn` remains unchanged. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` > 0, `mex` includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`; otherwise, `minn` remains `minn + 1`. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, `mex` has a new element appended which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
