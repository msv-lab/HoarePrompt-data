Reasoning: 

The given program attempts to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` following the rules specified in the problem statement. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` does not correctly follow these rules, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a list is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list. The function `func_1` uses `minn` to track this value, but it does not properly update `minn` when a new element is added to `mex`. Specifically, after adding `minn` to `mex`, it increments `minn` and then checks if `minn` is equal to `maxx`, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly ensure that `minn` is the smallest missing integer in `mex`.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**: The function `func_1` handles negative values in `a` by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This logic is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the appended value will be the correct MEX value for the current state of `mex`. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`, and this value should be calculated independently of the current value of `minn`.

3. **Updating `maxx`**: The function `func_1` updates `maxx` whenever a new value is added to `mex` that is greater than the current `maxx`. While this is a valid operation, it does not help in maintaining the correct MEX value for the current state of `mex`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should maintain a set of used numbers and calculate the MEX for each position `i` by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers. This can be efficiently done using a set and a loop to check for the smallest missing integer.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
