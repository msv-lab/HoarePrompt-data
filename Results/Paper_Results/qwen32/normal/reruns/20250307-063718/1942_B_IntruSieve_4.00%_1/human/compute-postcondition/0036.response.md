To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` evolve based on the input list `arr`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the loop logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` starts as an empty list.
   - `minn` starts at 0.
   - `maxx` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each element in `arr` (from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`):
     - If the element is greater than 0:
       - Append `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, set `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 0:
       - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `mex` will contain `n` elements.
   - `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `mex` (if all positive numbers were encountered in order, `minn` will be the count of positive numbers encountered).
   - `maxx` will be the maximum value encountered in `mex` due to the absolute differences.

Given the initial state and the detailed behavior of the loop, the final output state will be:

- `mex` will be a list of `n` integers, constructed as described above.
- `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer not included in `mex`.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value in `mex`.

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers constructed based on the rules described, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes:
- `mex` will have `n` elements, each determined by whether the corresponding element in `arr` was positive or non-positive.
- `minn` will be the smallest number not yet added to `mex`.
- `maxx` will be the largest number in `mex`.
