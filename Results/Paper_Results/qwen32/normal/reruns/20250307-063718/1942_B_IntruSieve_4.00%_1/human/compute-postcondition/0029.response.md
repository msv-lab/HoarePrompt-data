The code snippet provided increments the value of `minn` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `mex` still includes `minn` as its last element, but now `minn` has a new value which is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `mex` is a list that includes `minn + 1` as its last element, `minn` is `minn + 1`.**
