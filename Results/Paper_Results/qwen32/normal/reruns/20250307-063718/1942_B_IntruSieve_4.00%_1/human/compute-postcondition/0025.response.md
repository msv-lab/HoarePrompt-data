Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is unchanged, `mex` includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as its last element, `minn` is unchanged. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
