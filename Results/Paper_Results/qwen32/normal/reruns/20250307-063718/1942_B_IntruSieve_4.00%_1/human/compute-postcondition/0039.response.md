The only object in the loop head is the variable `itm`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `mex`. To execute one more time, `itm` should be the next element in the list `mex`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0. Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `itm` was the `k`-th element of the list `mex` (where `k` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). For the next iteration, `itm` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of the list `mex`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `k`, we can only describe the state in a general way. We know that `itm` should now be the next element in the list, and the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `mex`.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0, `itm` is the next element in the list `mex`**
