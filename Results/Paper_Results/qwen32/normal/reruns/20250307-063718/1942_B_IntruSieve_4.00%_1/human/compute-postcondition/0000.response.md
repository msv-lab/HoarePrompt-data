The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will change based on the input provided, but the initial state conditions for `t`, the remaining test cases, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**
