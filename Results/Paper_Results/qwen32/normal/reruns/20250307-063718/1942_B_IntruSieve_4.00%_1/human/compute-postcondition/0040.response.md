To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `itm` is described as "the next element in the list `mex`."

However, the term "the next element in the list `mex`" is ambiguous because it does not specify the context or the current position in the list. Let's assume a common scenario where `itm` is the first element of the list `mex` (since no starting index is provided and the list must contain at least one element).

Given this assumption:
- `itm` is the first element of the list `mex`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `mex` are not provided, we can only describe `itm` in terms of its position in the list.

Therefore, the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `mex`, followed by a space.

Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex)**
