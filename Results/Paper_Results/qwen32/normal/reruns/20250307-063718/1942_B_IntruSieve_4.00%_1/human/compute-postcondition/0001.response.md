The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, after executing the code, `arr` contains the integers read from the input, while all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
