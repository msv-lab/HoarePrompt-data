Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` includes `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[0] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.**
