The code snippet updates the value of `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mex`, and `minn` remain unchanged unless `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the previous `maxx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is unchanged, `mex` includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as its last element, `minn` is unchanged, `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
