The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since the initial state does not mention `mex` or `minn`, we assume `mex` is a list and `minn` is a variable with some value. 

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is greater than 0, and `mex` is a list that now includes `minn` as its last element.**
