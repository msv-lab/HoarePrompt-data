You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` as 0.
4. It iterates through the array `a`:
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a_i` is not greater than 0, it appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to `mex`.
5. It prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Correctness Check
Let's check if this logic correctly constructs the permutation `p` from `a`.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program should correctly identify the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to determine the next element of `p`.
2. **Handling Positive and Negative `a_i` Values**:
   - If `a_i > 0`, the MEX of the current prefix should be `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn`.
   - If `a_i <= 0`, the value `p_i` should be `MEX - a_i`, which is `abs(a_i - minn)` in the code.

#### Potential Issues:
- The code does not correctly handle the MEX calculation when `a_i <= 0`. Specifically, the code uses `abs(a_i - minn)` instead of properly calculating the MEX and adjusting `p_i` accordingly.
- The code does not ensure that `p` remains a permutation (i.e., all elements from 0 to n-1 are used exactly once).

### Example Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
- Program Output: `0 1 4 2 3` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
- Program Output: `0 1 2 3 4` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `-2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2 0 1`
- Program Output: `2 0 1` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

### Conclusion
Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the construction of the permutation `p` when `a_i <= 0`. The logic for constructing `p` is flawed, and the program does not ensure that `p` remains a permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
