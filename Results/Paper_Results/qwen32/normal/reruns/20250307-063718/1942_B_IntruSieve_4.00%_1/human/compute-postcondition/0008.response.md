The code snippet `minn += 1` increments the value of `minn` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `arr[i]`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is greater than 0, and `mex` is a list that now includes `minn + 1` as its last element.**
