To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `mex` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `itm` is the next element in the list `mex`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `itm` is described as "the next element in the list `mex`". However, the exact position of `itm` in the list `mex` is not specified. Typically, "the next element" would refer to the element immediately following another element, but without a reference point (like an index or a current element), we can assume `itm` is the first element of `mex` (i.e., `itm = mex[0]`), as it is the most straightforward interpretation given the constraints.

- The `print` statement will output the value of `itm` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Given that `itm` is the next element in the list `mex` and assuming it refers to the first element of `mex`, the output will be the first element of `mex` followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex)**

To make it more precise:
Output: **mex[0] (where mex[0] is the first element of the list mex)**
