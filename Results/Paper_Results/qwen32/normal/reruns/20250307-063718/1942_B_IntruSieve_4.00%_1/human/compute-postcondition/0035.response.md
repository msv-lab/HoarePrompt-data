Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` > 0, `mex` includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`; otherwise, `minn` remains `minn + 1`. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, `mex` has a new element appended which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
