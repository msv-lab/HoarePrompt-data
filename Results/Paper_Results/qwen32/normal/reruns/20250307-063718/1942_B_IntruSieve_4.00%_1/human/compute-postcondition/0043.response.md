To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand that the loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it. The loop will execute for as many times as there are elements in the list `mex`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `mex`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: `mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.
2. **Output State after 1 iteration**: The loop has printed the first element of `mex`.
3. **Output State after 2 iterations**: The loop has printed the first two elements of `mex`.
4. **Output State after 3 iterations**: The loop has printed the first three elements of `mex`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, the loop will have printed all elements of `mex`.

Therefore, the final output state will be all elements of the list `mex` printed in sequence, separated by spaces. The variables `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **all elements of `mex` printed in sequence, separated by spaces.**

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements of the list `mex` are printed in order, separated by spaces. The variables `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged.
