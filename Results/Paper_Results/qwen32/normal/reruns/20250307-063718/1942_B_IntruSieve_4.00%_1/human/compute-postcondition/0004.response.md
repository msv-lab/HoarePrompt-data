Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `maxx` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the Initial State.
