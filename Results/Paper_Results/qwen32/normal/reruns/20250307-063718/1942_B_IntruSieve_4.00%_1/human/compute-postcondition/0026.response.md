Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn` as its last element, and `minn` is increased by 1. If `minn` was equal to `maxx` before the if statement, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as its last element, and `minn` remains unchanged. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
