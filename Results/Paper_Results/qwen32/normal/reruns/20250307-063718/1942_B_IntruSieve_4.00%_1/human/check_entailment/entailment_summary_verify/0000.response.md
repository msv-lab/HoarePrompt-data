### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the given function summary. We need to verify if the program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

#### Issue Analysis:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program uses a variable `minn` to track the current minimum non-negative integer that has not been used yet. However, it does not maintain a set of used numbers to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated. This can lead to incorrect MEX values, especially when handling negative values in \( a \).

2. **Handling Negative Values**: The program incorrectly handles negative values in \( a \). When \( a_i \) is negative, the program calculates \( p_i \) as \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \). This does not guarantee that the MEX condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) is satisfied.

3. **Dynamic MEX Calculation**: The program does not dynamically calculate the MEX by checking which numbers have been used so far. Instead, it relies on a simple increment of `minn`, which can lead to incorrect results when the smallest unused number is not the next integer in sequence.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and dynamically calculate the MEX for each step. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used.add(mex)
        used.add(mex + a[i])
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and that the permutation \( p \) satisfies the given array \( a \).

#### Evaluation of the Original Program:
The original program does not correctly handle the dynamic calculation of the MEX and does not maintain a set of used numbers to ensure the MEX condition is satisfied. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
