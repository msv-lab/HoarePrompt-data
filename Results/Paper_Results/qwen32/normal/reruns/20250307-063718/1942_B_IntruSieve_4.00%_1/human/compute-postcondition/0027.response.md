The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
