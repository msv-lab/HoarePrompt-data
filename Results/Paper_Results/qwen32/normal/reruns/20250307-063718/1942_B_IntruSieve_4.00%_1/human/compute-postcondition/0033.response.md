The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the variable `maxx`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `mex` list has a new element appended, which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, but this does not affect the current operation.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `mex` has a new element appended which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
