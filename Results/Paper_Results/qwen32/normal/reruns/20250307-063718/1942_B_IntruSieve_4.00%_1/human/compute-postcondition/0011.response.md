Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is greater than 0, and `mex` is a list that now includes `minn + 1` as its last element. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, there is no change to `minn`.**
