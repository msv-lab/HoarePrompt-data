The code snippet provided sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This directly affects the value of `minn` based on the current value of `maxx`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The conditions regarding `arr[0]`, `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` are described, but the specific values of `minn` and `maxx` are not provided.

After executing the line `minn = maxx + 1`, the value of `minn` is updated to be `maxx + 1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `minn` is `maxx + 1`.**
