The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `mex` is updated by appending a new element, which is the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `mex` has a new element appended which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
