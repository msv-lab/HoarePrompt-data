Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The task is to find a permutation `p` such that the given array `a` can be derived from `p` using the above formula.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided tries to construct the permutation `p` as follows:
1. For each element in `a`, it checks if the element is positive or negative.
2. If the element is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. It also adjusts `minn` if it equals `maxx`.
3. If the element is negative, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list and updates `maxx` if necessary.
4. Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Program:
The program's logic does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the MEX rule. Specifically:
- The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be directly derived from `minn` and `maxx` without properly checking the presence of numbers in the constructed permutation.
- The handling of negative values in `a` does not correctly map to the MEX rule.
- The program does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` contains all integers from 0 to n-1 exactly once, which is a requirement for a valid permutation.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for constructing the permutation `p` is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the output will be a valid permutation that satisfies the given array `a`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
