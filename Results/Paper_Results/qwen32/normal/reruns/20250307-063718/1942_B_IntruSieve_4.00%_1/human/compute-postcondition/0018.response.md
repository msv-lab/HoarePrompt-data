The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The states of `t`, `mex`, `minn`, `maxx`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and should not be modified based on the loop head's requirements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` includes `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[0] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[0] - minn)`**
