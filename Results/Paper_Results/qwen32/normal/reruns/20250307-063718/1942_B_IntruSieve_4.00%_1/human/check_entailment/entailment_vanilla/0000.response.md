To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` as 0.
4. It iterates through the array `a`:
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a_i` is not greater than 0, it appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to `mex`.
5. It prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Correctness Check
Let's check if this logic correctly constructs the permutation `p` from `a`.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program should correctly identify the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to determine the next element of `p`.
2. **Handling Positive and Negative `a_i` Values**:
   - If `a_i > 0`, the MEX of the current prefix should be `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn`.
   - If `a_i <= 0`, the value `p_i` should be `MEX - a_i`, which is `abs(a_i - minn)` in the code.

#### Potential Issues:
- The code does not correctly handle the MEX calculation when `a_i <= 0`. Specifically, the code uses `abs(a_i - minn)` instead of properly calculating the MEX and adjusting `p_i` accordingly.
- The code does not ensure that `p` remains a permutation (i.e., all elements from 0 to n-1 are used exactly once).

### Example Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
- Program Output: `0 1 4 2 3` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
- Program Output: `0 1 2 3 4` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `-2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2 0 1`
- Program Output: `2 0 1` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

### Conclusion
Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the construction of the permutation `p` when `a_i <= 0`. The logic for constructing `p` is flawed, and the program does not ensure that `p` remains a permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
