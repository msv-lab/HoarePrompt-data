Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` retains its original value. `mex` contains the value `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.**
