Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX value and construct the permutation \( p \) using a flawed logic. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the relationship between \( a_i \) and \( p_i \).

2. **Handling of Negative Values**: The program incorrectly handles negative values in the array \( a \). The MEX value should be calculated based on the current set of elements in \( p \), and \( p_i \) should be determined such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

3. **Updating MEX**: The program does not maintain the set of used numbers to correctly determine the MEX value at each step. Instead, it uses a simple increment logic for `minn` and `maxx`, which does not reflect the actual MEX value.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Maintain a set of used numbers.
- Calculate the MEX value based on this set.
- Determine \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- Update the set of used numbers accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    mex = 0
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p_i = mex - a[i]
        p.append(p_i)
        used.add(p_i)
    
    print(*p)
```

This corrected version maintains the set of used numbers, calculates the MEX value correctly, and constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
