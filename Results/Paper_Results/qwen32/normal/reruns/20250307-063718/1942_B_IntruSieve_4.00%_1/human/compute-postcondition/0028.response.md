The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `mex` now includes `minn` as an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `mex` is a list that includes `minn` as its last element.**
