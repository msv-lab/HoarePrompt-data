### Reasoning

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the logic and the annotations provided, and compare them against the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
2. Initializes an empty list `mex` and two variables `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
3. Iterates through the array `a`:
   - If `a_i > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a_i <= 0`, it appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to `mex`.
4. Prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

#### Annotations Analysis
The annotations indicate the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, and `a` is the array of integers.
- During the loop:
  - `mex` is a list of integers constructed based on the rules described.
  - `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`.
  - `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.
- After the loop: The elements of `mex` are printed in sequence.

#### Issues in the Program
1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program uses `minn` as the MEX when `a_i > 0`, which is correct as long as `minn` is indeed the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`.
   - However, when `a_i <= 0`, the program uses `abs(a_i - minn)`, which does not correctly compute the MEX. The correct approach would be to find the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and then determine `p_i` as `MEX - a_i`.

2. **Ensuring Permutation**:
   - The program does not ensure that all integers from 0 to n-1 are used exactly once in `mex`.

3. **Handling Negative Values**:
   - The program's logic for handling negative values of `a_i` is flawed. It should correctly compute the MEX and adjust `p_i` accordingly.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
- Program Output: `0 1 4 2 3` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
- Program Output: `0 1 2 3 4` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `-2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2 0 1`
- Program Output: `2 0 1` (if the logic were correct, but we need to verify the logic)

Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the construction of the permutation `p` when `a_i <= 0`. The logic for constructing `p` is flawed, and the program does not ensure that `p` remains a permutation.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX and handle the permutation construction, especially for negative values of `a_i`.

**Final: False**
