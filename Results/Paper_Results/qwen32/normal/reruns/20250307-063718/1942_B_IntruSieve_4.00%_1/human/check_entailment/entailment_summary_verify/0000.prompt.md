You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It constructs a list `mex` based on specific rules involving the elements of `a` and two variables `minn` and `maxx`. The function then prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample to show why it fails:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program incorrectly calculates the MEX value. It does not properly keep track of which numbers have been used in the permutation \( p \) and thus does not correctly determine the smallest unused non-negative integer.

2. **Handling Negative Values**: The program does not handle negative values in \( a \) correctly. When \( a_i \) is negative, it should find the correct value of \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program might output something like:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
However, let's verify if this output is correct:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( \text{MEX}([0]) = 1 \), and \( a_1 = 1 = 1 - 0 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \), and \( a_2 = 1 = 2 - 1 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2 \), and \( a_3 = -2 \neq 2 - 4 \) (incorrect, should be \( 2 - 4 = -2 \) which is correct, but the program might not handle this correctly in all cases)
- For \( i = 4 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 1 = 3 - 2 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 5 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5 \), and \( a_5 = 2 = 5 - 3 \) (correct)

However, the program's logic to handle the MEX calculation and negative values can fail in other scenarios. Here's a more concrete counterexample:

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 1 -1 -1 0
```
The program might output something like:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```
However, this output is incorrect:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( \text{MEX}([0]) = 1 \), and \( a_1 = 1 = 1 - 0 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \), and \( a_2 = 1 = 2 - 1 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2]) = 3 \), and \( a_3 = -1 \neq 3 - 2 \) (incorrect, should be \( 2 - 3 = -1 \) which is correct, but the program might not handle this correctly in all cases)
- For \( i = 4 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2, 3]) = 4 \), and \( a_4 = -1 \neq 4 - 3 \) (incorrect, should be \( 3 - 4 = -1 \) which is correct, but the program might not handle this correctly in all cases)
- For \( i = 5 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 5 \), and \( a_5 = 0 \neq 5 - 4 \) (incorrect, should be \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) which is correct, but the program might not handle this correctly in all cases)

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves maintaining a set of used numbers and calculating the MEX dynamically. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used.add(mex)
        used.add(mex + a[i])
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and that the permutation \( p \) satisfies the given array \( a \).
