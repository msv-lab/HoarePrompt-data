The code snippet assigns `minn` the value of `maxx + 1`. Given that `minn` was previously equal to `maxx`, after the execution of the code, `minn` will be one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is greater than 0, `mex` is a list that now includes `minn + 1` as its last element, and `minn` is equal to `maxx + 1`.**
