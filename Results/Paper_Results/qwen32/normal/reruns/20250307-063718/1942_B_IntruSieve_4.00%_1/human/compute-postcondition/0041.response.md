The only variable in the loop head is `itm`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the list `mex`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `mex` and the current value of `itm`. If there are more elements in the list `mex`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `itm` is the next element in the list `mex`. For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must have at least one more element after `itm`.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 1, `itm` is the next element in the list `mex`**
