### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic used in the program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- The MEX (minimum non-negative integer not in the array) needs to be calculated dynamically as the permutation is being constructed.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex = []`: This list is intended to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn = 0`: This variable is intended to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - `maxx = 0`: This variable is intended to keep track of the maximum value in the permutation.

2. **Loop through the array \( a \)**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`:
       - Append `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, increment `minn` by 1 again.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`:
       - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, update `maxx`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly maintain the set of used numbers in the permutation \( p \).
   - The `minn` variable is not always the correct MEX because it does not account for all previously used numbers.

2. **Handling Negative Values**:
   - The program's logic to handle negative values in \( a \) is flawed. It does not ensure that the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) is met correctly.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program might output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
Let's verify:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( \text{MEX}([0]) = 1 \), and \( a_1 = 1 = 1 - 0 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \), and \( a_2 = 1 = 2 - 1 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2 \), and \( a_3 = -2 \neq 2 - 4 \) (incorrect, should be \( 2 - 4 = -2 \), but the program might not handle this correctly in all cases)
- For \( i = 4 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 1 = 3 - 2 \) (correct)
- For \( i = 5 \): \( \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5 \), and \( a_5 = 2 = 5 - 3 \) (correct)

However, the logic to handle the MEX calculation and negative values can fail in other scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves maintaining a set of used numbers and calculating the MEX dynamically. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used.add(mex)
        used.add(mex + a[i])
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and that the permutation \( p \) satisfies the given array \( a \).

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
