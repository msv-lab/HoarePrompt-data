In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `itm`. However, the loop's execution depends on the list `mex` itself. The loop will execute if `mex` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `mex` is not empty.

Given the description, `mex` is a list of `n` integers, and `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `minn` and `maxx` are dependent on the values in `mex`, but they don't directly influence whether the loop can execute or not. Hence, we only need to ensure that `mex` has at least one element.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`**. 

However, strictly adhering to the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, and since `itm` is the only variable in the loop head, we can state:

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0**.
