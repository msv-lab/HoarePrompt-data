The code snippet `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is less than or equal to 0. The value of `minn` is not specified, but it is used in the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` contains the value `abs(arr[0] - minn)`**

In natural language: The variable `mex` now contains one element, which is the absolute difference between `arr[0]` and `minn`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged.
