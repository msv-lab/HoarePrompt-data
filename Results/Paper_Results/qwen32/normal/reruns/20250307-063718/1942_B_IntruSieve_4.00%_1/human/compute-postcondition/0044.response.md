Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- The initial state mentions that all elements of `mex` are printed in sequence, separated by spaces.

### Code Snippet:
- The provided Python code snippet is:
  ```python
  print()
  ```

### Explanation:
- The `print()` function in Python, when called without any arguments, prints a newline character by default.
- The initial state does not provide any specific elements or values of `mex`, and the `print()` statement in the code does not reference `mex` at all.

### Conclusion:
- Since the `print()` statement does not have any arguments, it will simply print a newline character.

### Output:
Output: **(a newline character)**
