To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is attempting to print a variable named `itm`.
- However, the variable `itm` is not defined in the initial state provided.
- Since `itm` is not defined, attempting to print it would result in a `NameError`.

Given the provided initial state, there is no information about the existence or value of `itm`. Therefore, the code as written will not execute successfully due to the undefined variable `itm`.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `itm` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, based on the task requirements, we should describe the output in the specified format.

Output: **NameError: name 'itm' is not defined**
