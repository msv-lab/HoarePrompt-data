The code snippet provided is simply `temp = set()`, which initializes the `temp` variable as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is the set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is an empty set.**
