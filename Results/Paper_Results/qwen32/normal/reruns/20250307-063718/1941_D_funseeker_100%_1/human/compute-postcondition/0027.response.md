The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` will split the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assign them to `r` and `c`. Since `r` was previously an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer) and `c` was the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, after executing the code, `r` will be reassigned to the first part of the new string returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` will be assigned to the second part of the new string. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
