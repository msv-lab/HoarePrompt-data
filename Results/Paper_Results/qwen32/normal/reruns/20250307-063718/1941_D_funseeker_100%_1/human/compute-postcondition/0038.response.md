The code adds a new element to the set `temp` which is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new element to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the additional element `(q + r) % n`.**
