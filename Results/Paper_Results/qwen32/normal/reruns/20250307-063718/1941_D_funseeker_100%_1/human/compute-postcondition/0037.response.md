The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over the elements in the set `ans`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `q` to the next element in the set `ans`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `m` is `m - 1`.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

Since `q` is the loop variable and it iterates over the elements in `ans`, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be the next element in `ans`. The set `ans` is not modified within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`**.
