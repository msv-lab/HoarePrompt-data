To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the process and understand the transformations applied to the variables during each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: An integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m`: An integer between 1 and 1000, representing the number of iterations.
- `x`: An integer between 1 and `n`.
- `ans`: A set initialized with the integer `x`.

### Loop Iteration Process:
1. **Initialization**: For each iteration, `r` and `c` are obtained from `func_1()` where `r` is an integer and `c` is a character ('0', '1', or '?').
2. **Computation**: A temporary set `temp` is created. For each element `q` in `ans`, the following operations are performed:
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
3. **Update**: The set `ans` is updated to be equal to `temp`.

### Final Output State:
After `m` iterations, the set `ans` will contain all unique indices that can be reached from the initial `x` by performing the allowed operations (addition or subtraction by `r` modulo `n`) up to `m` times.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `n` remains unchanged. The variable `m` becomes 0 because the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `x` remains the same as it was initially. The set `ans` now contains all unique integers that can be reached starting from `x` by either adding or subtracting `r` (modulo `n`) up to `m` times, depending on the value of `c` for each iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.**
