The code snippet provided adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged unless specifically modified by the code. Since `temp` is the only set being modified, its contents will now include the new element `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans` after the previous `q`, `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`.**
