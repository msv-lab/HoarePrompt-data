The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which is the loop variable iterating over the set `ans`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `q` to the next element in `ans`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `m` is `m - 1`.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `q` is the next element in `ans`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains the additional element `(q + r) % n`.

Since the loop iterates over `ans`, and `q` is the next element in `ans` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `q` should be updated to the next element in `ans` if there is one. If `q` was the last element in `ans` during the previous iteration, the loop would terminate.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains the additional element `(q + r) % n`.** 

However, to specifically adjust for the start of the next iteration, we need to denote that `q` is now the subsequent element in `ans`:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans` after the previous `q`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains the additional element `(q + r) % n`.**

Since the exact next element cannot be specified without knowing the specific elements in `ans`, the state at the start of the next iteration is described as above, with `q` being the next element in `ans` after the previous one.
