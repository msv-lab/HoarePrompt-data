The code snippet initializes a set `ans` with the value of `x`. This action does not change the values of `n` and `m`. The variable `x` is used to populate the set `ans`, which now contains `x` as its only element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`.**
