To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` and `temp` sets. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`.
   - `r` is an integer derived from the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `q` in the `ans` set.
   - Depending on the value of `c`:
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '0', only `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.
   - After processing all elements in `ans`, the `ans` set is updated to be the union of `ans` and `temp`, and `temp` is cleared for the next iteration.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop continues until `temp` is empty after an iteration, meaning no new elements are added to `ans`.
   - The final `ans` set will contain all unique elements that can be generated by repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from `x` and considering the condition on `c`.

**Output State**: **The `ans` set contains all unique integers that can be generated by repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from `x` and considering the condition on `c`. The `temp` set is empty. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the final output state is that the `ans` set will include all unique integers that can be reached by starting from `x` and applying the specified operations based on the value of `c`. The `temp` set will be empty as there are no new elements to add after the final iteration. All other variables retain their initial values.
