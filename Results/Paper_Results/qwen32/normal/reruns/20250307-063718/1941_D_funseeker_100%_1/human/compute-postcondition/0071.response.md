Output State: **`n` remains the same; `m` is incremented by the number of iterations (equal to the number of elements in `ans`); `x` remains the same; `ans` is updated to contain all unique elements computed as `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans`; `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`; `temp` is no longer a separate variable as its contents are assigned to `ans`.**

In simple terms, the value of `n`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is increased by the number of elements in the initial `ans`. The variable `ans` is updated to contain all unique values computed from the expressions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in the initial `ans`. The variable `temp` is no longer a separate variable as its contents have been assigned to `ans`.
