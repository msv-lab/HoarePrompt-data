### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and verify if it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_3()` reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `x`.
   - For each throw, `func_1()` reads the distance `r` and direction `c`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, the direction `c` determines whether the throw is clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown.
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball can be thrown clockwise, and the new player number is `(q + r) % n`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball can be thrown counterclockwise, and the new player number is `(q - r) % n`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to include all possible players who could have the ball after the throw.
   - After all throws, the set `ans` contains all unique players who could have the ball.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced by `n` because player numbers are 1-based, not 0-based.

4. **Output:**
   - The size of the set `ans` is printed, followed by the sorted list of players in `ans`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the provided code with the example given in the problem statement.

**Example Input:**
```
5
6 3 2
2 ?
2 ?
2 ?
12 1 2
3 1
10 7 4
2 ?
9 1
4 ?
7 0
2 0
8 1
5 ?
5 3 1
4 0
4 ?
1 ?
4 1 1
2 ?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
2 4 6 
1
11 
4
3 5 7 9 
3
2 3 5 
1
3 
```

**Execution:**
- For the first test case, the ball starts with player 2. After three throws with unknown directions, the possible players are 2, 4, and 6.
- For the second test case, the ball starts with player 2 and is thrown 3 positions clockwise, ending with player 11.
- For the third test case, the ball starts with player 4 and goes through a series of throws, resulting in possible players 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- For the fourth test case, the ball starts with player 1 and goes through a series of throws, resulting in possible players 2, 3, and 5.
- For the fifth test case, the ball starts with player 1 and can only be thrown 2 positions in an unknown direction, resulting in player 3.

The code correctly computes the possible players who could have the ball after each set of throws for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the problem description and handles the given example correctly.

**Correctness: True**
