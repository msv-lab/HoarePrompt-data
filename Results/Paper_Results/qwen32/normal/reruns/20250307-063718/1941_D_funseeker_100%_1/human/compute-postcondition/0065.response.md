The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If `ans` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in `ans`.

At the end of the last iteration, `q` is `q_next` (the next element in `ans`). For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least one more element after `q`. The value of `q` at the start of the next iteration will be the next element in `ans`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`**
