The code snippet provided is `r = int(r)`. This line converts the variable `r`, which is currently a string (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`), into an integer.

Given the initial state, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. After the execution of `r = int(r)`, `r` remains an integer value, but it is explicitly defined as such now.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`, and `temp`) are not directly affected by this line of code and retain their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is the set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
