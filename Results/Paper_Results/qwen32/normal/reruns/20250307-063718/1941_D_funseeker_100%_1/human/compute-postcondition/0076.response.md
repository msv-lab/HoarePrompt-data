Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times. If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` is included in `ans` and 0 is excluded from `ans`. If 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.**
