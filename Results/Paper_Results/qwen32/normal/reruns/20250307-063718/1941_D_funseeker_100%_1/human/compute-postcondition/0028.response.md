Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

In simple terms, the value of `r` has been converted to an integer, while all other variables remain unchanged.
