Postcondition: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two integers (including `x`), `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `q` is the next element in `ans` after the current `q`. If `c` is '1' or '?', the set `temp` includes the new element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', the set `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.**
