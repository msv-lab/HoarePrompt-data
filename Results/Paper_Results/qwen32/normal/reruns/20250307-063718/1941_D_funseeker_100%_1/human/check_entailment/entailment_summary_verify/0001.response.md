### Reasoning:

Let's go through the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to assess the correctness of the program systematically.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - Players are numbered from 1 to `n` in a circle.
    - The ball starts with player `x`.
    - For `m` throws, the ball is thrown a distance `r_i` either clockwise (`'0'`), counterclockwise (`'1'`), or in either direction (`'?'`).
    - We need to determine all possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

2. **Program Explanation**:
    - The program reads input using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
    - For each test case, it initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
    - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction `c_i`:
        - If `c_i` is `'0'` (clockwise), it adds `(q + r) % n` to `ans`.
        - If `c_i` is `'1'` (counterclockwise), it adds `(q - r) % n` to `ans`.
        - If `c_i` is `'?'`, it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to `ans`.
    - The modulo operation ensures that the player number wraps around correctly within the circle.
    - After processing all throws, it handles the case where `0` might be in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`.
    - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Function Summary**:
    - The function summary for `func_4` accurately describes the function's behavior: it calculates and prints the number of unique players who can have the ball after `m` throws, starting from player `x`, and prints the sorted list of these player numbers.

4. **Verification**:
    - The program correctly handles all possible directions for each throw.
    - Using a set to keep track of all possible players ensures that duplicates are avoided.
    - The modulo operation correctly handles wrapping around the circle.
    - The program outputs the number of possible players and their sorted list as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program handles the case where `0` might appear in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`. This is necessary because the modulo operation can result in `0` when the player number wraps around.
    - The program correctly processes throws with direction `'?'` by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for throws marked with `'?'`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
