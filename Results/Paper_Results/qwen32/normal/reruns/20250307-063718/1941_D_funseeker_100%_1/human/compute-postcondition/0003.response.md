The code snippet provided assigns the values of `r` and `c` by splitting the output of `func_1()`, which is expected to return a string that can be split into two parts. This operation does not affect the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, or `ans` directly. 

Therefore, the Output State will include the new variables `r` and `c` with their respective values derived from the split operation of `func_1()`. However, since the exact return value of `func_1()` is not specified, we can only denote that `r` and `c` will be the two parts of the string returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` must be at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`**.
