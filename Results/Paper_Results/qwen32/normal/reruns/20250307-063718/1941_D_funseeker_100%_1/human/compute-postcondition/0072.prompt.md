Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is the set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains the same; `m` is incremented by the number of iterations (equal to the number of elements in `ans`); `x` remains the same; `ans` is updated to contain all unique elements computed as `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans`; `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`; `temp` is no longer a separate variable as its contents are assigned to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
