You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the initial player number who has the ball such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times. If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` is included in `ans` and 0 is excluded from `ans`. If 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: 1 (where ans contains only the integer x)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: x
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (an integer representing the number of throws made, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (an integer representing the initial player number who has the ball, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the player number who has the ball after `m` throws.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
