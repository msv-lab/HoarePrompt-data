The only object in the loop head is the variable `m`, as it is the only variable that is used in the loop condition `for _ in range(m)`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is `m - 1`.

To execute one more iteration of the loop, `m` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be the current value of `m` plus 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is the set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
