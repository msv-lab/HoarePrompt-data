Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans` after the previous `q`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is not '1' or '?', no additional element is added to `temp`.**
