The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `m`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `m` to ensure the loop can execute again.

Given that `m` is at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates `m` times).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1 (now `m` should be `m - 1`), `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set**.

Since `m` is at least 1, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to set `m` to `m - 1`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set**.
