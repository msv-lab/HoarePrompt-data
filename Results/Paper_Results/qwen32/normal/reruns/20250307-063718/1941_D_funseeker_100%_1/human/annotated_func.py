#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and its behavior is not described in the provided code snippet.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the next line of input from the standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters and therefore no specific precondition can be derived from its signature alone.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of converting the return value of `func_1()` to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` returns an integer value, which is the result of converting the return value of `func_1()` to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a list of integers. The integers in the list are obtained by splitting the input string from the function `func_1` and converting each split string into an integer.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string from the function `func_1` and converting each split string into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are obtained by splitting an input string from the function `func_1` and converting each split string into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the initial player number who has the ball such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)

    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times. If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` is included in `ans` and 0 is excluded from `ans`. If 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: 1 (where ans contains only the integer x)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of unique players who can have the ball after `m` throws, starting from player `x`. It also prints the sorted list of these player numbers.
