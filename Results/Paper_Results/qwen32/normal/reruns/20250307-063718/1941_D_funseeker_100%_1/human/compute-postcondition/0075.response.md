The code snippet `ans.add(n)` adds the integer `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` is initially a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times, excluding 0, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, the set `ans` will now include `n` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that includes `n` and can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times, excluding 0.**
