To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. Let's analyze the loop and the given output states:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`: an integer where 2 <= n <= 1000.
   - `m`: incremented by 1 each time the loop executes.
   - `x`: an integer where 1 <= x <= n.
   - `ans`: a set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`.
   - `r`: the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c`: the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp`: an empty set.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `q` in `ans`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', add `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', add `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

3. **Output State after 1 Iteration:**
   - `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` contains at least one element.
   - `r` and `c` are derived from `func_1()`.
   - `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on `c`.

4. **Output State after 2 Iterations:**
   - `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` contains at least one element.
   - `r` and `c` are derived from `func_1()`.
   - `temp` includes `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for the next `q` in `ans`.

5. **Output State after 3 Iterations:**
   - `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` contains at least one more element.
   - `r` and `c` are derived from `func_1()`.
   - `temp` includes `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for the next `q` in `ans`.

After all iterations of the loop, the following holds:
- `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `ans` will have been fully processed, with each element `q` contributing to `temp` based on the value of `c`.
- `temp` will contain all the computed values from the loop iterations.
- `r` and `c` will be the values from the last iteration of `func_1()`.

Since the loop processes each element of `ans` exactly once, the final state of `temp` will be the union of all the sets computed during each iteration.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` is incremented by the number of iterations (equal to the number of elements in `ans`).
- `x` remains the same.
- `ans` remains the same.
- `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`.
- `temp` contains all unique elements computed as `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans`.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `m` is incremented by the number of elements in `ans`, `x` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, and `temp` contains all unique elements computed as `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans`.**
