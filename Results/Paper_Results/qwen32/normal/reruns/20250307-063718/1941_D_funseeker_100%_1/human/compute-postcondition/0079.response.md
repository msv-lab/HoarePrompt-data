Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (an integer representing the number of throws made, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (an integer representing the initial player number who has the ball, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the player number who has the ball after `m` throws.**
