To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the operations that are described.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is 0.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.
- If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` is included in `ans` and 0 is excluded from `ans`.
- If 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `m`**: Since `m` is 0, no operations can be performed to modify the set `ans`. This means that `ans` will only contain the integer `x` initially, unless there are additional rules or operations that are not explicitly mentioned but implied by the conditions involving 0.

2. **Set `ans`**: Given the conditions:
   - If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` would be included and 0 would be excluded. However, since `m` is 0 and no operations are performed, there is no way for 0 to be added to `ans` initially. Therefore, this condition does not apply.
   - If 0 is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged. Since we start with no operations and no initial inclusion of 0, `ans` will only contain `x`.

3. **Output**: The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the elements of the set `ans` in sorted order. Since `ans` contains only the integer `x` and no other elements, the sorted order will simply be `[x]`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **x (where x is the integer between 1 and n)**

However, to adhere strictly to the format requested:
Output: **x**
