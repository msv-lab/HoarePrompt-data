The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are replaced by whatever values `func_3()` returns. The conditions on `n`, `m`, and `x` (i.e., `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`) still need to hold true for the values returned by `func_3()`.

Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the variables `n`, `m`, and `x` taking on new values returned by the function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n.**
