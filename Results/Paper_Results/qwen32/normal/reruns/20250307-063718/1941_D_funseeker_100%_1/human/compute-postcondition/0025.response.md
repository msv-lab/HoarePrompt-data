Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `temp`, which is an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values.
