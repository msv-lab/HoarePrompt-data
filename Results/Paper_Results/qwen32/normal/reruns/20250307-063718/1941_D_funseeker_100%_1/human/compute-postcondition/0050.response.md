The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c` respectively. The initial state does not provide the specific return value of `func_1()`, so we can only express the output state in terms of the values returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is the set of elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
