Postcondition: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
