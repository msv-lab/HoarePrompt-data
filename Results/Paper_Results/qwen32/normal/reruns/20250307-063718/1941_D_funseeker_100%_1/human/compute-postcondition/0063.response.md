The provided code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. Specifically, it adds the value `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` are already defined. The only change is the addition of a new element to the set `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is `q_next` (the next element in `ans`), `temp` includes the tuple `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
