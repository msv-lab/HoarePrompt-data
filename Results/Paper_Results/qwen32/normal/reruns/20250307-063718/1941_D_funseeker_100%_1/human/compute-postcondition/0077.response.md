To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is 0.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times.
- If 0 is in `ans`, then `n` is included in `ans` and 0 is excluded from `ans`.
- If 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

### Key Points:
- `m` is 0, which means no operations are performed to modify `ans`.
- `ans` is initialized with some integers that can be reached from `x` without any operations (since `m` is 0).
- The condition involving 0 does not affect the set `ans` because `m` is 0, meaning no operations are performed that could add or remove elements from `ans`.

### Determining the Output:
Since `m` is 0, no operations are performed to modify the set `ans`. Therefore, `ans` contains only the integer `x` (assuming no other operations were performed before this point in the code).

Thus, the length of `ans` is 1, because it contains only the integer `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 (where ans contains only the integer x)**
