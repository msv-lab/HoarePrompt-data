The code snippet adds a new element to the `temp` set, calculated as `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `m` is `m - 1` (though `m` itself is not used in the given code snippet, it is mentioned in the initial state, so we keep it as is).
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.
- `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'.

After executing the code snippet, `temp` will now contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
