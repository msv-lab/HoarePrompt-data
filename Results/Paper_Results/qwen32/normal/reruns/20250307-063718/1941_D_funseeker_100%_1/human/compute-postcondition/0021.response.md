The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. This new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is a set containing at least two integers, including `x`.
- `r` is an integer.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `q` is the next element in `ans` after the current `q`.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.

The only change in the output state is that the set `temp` now includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two integers (including `x`), `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `q` is the next element in `ans` after the current `q`. The set `temp` includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.**
