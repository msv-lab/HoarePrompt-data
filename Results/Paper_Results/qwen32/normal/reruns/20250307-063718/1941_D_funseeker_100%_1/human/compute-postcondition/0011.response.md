The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is `(q - r) % n`. Since `temp` was initially a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`, after the code snippet executes, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is in the set `temp`, which now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` (either '1' or '?'), `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
