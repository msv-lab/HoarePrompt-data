The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` could already contain elements based on the value of `c` and the computation involving `q`, `r`, and `n`.

- If `c` was '0' or '?', `temp` initially contained `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` was '1', `temp` initially contained `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- Otherwise, `temp` was empty.

After executing `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` will definitely contain `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '1', `(q - r) % n` was already in `temp`, so `temp` will remain unchanged. If `c` was '0' or '?', `temp` will now contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was something else, `temp` will now contain only `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two integers (including `x`), `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the element `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans` after `x`.**
