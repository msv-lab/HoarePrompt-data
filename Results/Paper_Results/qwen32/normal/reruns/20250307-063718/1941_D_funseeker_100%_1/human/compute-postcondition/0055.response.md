Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` is either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
