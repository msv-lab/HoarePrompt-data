The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` is the next element in `ans` after `x`, `r` is an integer derived from the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, the value of `(q + r) % n` will be a valid integer within the range of 0 to n-1.

Given the initial state, `temp` could either be an empty set or a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` depending on the value of `c`. After executing the code, the set `temp` will definitely contain the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '1' or '?', it will also contain `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was not '1' or '?', `temp` will only contain `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two integers (including `x`), `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans` after `x`.**
