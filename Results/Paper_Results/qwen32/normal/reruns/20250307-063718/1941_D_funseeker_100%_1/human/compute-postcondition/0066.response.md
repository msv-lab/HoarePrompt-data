Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` has been incremented by 1, `x` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` still contains at least one more element, `r` and `c` remain as the parts of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` remains as the next element in `ans`, and `temp` now includes the element `(q + r) % n`.
