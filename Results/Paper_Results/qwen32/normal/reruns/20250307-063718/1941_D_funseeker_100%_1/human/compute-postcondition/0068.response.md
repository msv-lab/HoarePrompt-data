The given code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp` based on the current values of `q`, `r`, and `n`. Specifically, it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `temp` is updated to include `(q - r) % n`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is the current value of `m` plus 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n` and the new element `(q - r) % n`.**
