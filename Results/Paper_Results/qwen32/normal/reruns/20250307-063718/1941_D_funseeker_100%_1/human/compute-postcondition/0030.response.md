The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over the elements of `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust `ans` to contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set**
