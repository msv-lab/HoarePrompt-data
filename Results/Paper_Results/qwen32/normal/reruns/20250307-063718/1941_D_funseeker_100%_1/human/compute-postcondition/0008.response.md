The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Since the value of `q` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the new element added to `temp`. However, we can express the new element in terms of `q`, `r`, and `n`.

The initial state specifies that `temp` is an empty set. After executing the code, `temp` will contain one element, which is `(q + r) % n`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` and its value is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`.**
