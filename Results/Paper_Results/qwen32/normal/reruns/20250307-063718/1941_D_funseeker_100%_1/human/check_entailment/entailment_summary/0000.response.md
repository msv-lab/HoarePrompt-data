### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of multiple functions that work together to solve the given problem. Let's break down the functionality of each function and see if they collectively meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Code**: `def func_1(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()`
   - **Output Hints**: Reads a line from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
   - **Reasoning**: This function is correctly implemented to read input lines as specified in the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Code**: `def func_2(): return int(func_1())`
   - **Output Hints**: Converts the return value of `func_1()` to an integer and returns it.
   - **Reasoning**: This function correctly reads and converts the first line of input, which is the number of test cases (`t`).

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Code**: `def func_3(): return list(map(int, func_1().split()))`
   - **Output Hints**: Splits an input string from `func_1` into a list of integers.
   - **Reasoning**: This function correctly reads and converts space-separated integers from the input, which are the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Code**: This function is the core logic of the problem.
     ```python
     def func_4():
         (n, m, x) = func_3()
         ans = {x}
         for _ in range(m):
             (r, c) = func_1().split()
             r = int(r)
             temp = set()
             for q in ans:
                 if c == '0' or c == '?':
                     temp.add((q + r) % n)
                 if c == '1' or c == '?':
                     temp.add((q - r) % n)
             ans = temp
         if 0 in ans:
             ans.discard(0)
             ans.add(n)
         print(len(ans))
         print(*sorted(ans))
     ```
   - **Output Hints**: Calculates and prints the number of unique players who can have the ball after `m` throws, starting from player `x`. It also prints the sorted list of these player numbers.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized as a set containing the starting player `x`.
     - **Loop through throws**: For each throw, the function reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. Depending on the direction, it calculates the new player positions and updates the `ans` set.
     - **Handling modulo**: The modulo operation ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly in the circle.
     - **Handling '0' and '?':** If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player position after a clockwise throw to the `temp` set.
     - **Handling '1' and '?':** If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player position after a counterclockwise throw to the `temp` set.
     - **Updating `ans`**: After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to `temp`.
     - **Handling edge case (player 0)**: If `0` is in `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation), it is replaced with `n`.
     - **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of unique players and the sorted list of these players.

### Conclusion:
All functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the possible players who can have the ball after `m` throws, considering the directions and distances provided. The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
