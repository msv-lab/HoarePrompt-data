Output State: **`n` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` must be at least 1, `x` is an integer returned by `func_3()` such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer (the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`**

In this output state, the variable `r` has been converted from a string to an integer. All other variables retain their initial states.
