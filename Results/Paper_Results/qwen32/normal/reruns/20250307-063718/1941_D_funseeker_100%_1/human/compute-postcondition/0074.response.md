The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Given the initial state, `0` is in `ans`, so it will be removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set of unique integers that can be reached from `x` by performing the allowed operations up to `m` times, excluding 0.**
