Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains the additional element `(q + r) % n`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains the same, as does the value of `m` (which is `m - 1`), `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c`. The variable `q` remains the next element in `ans`. The set `temp` now includes the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` also includes the element `(q + r) % n`.
