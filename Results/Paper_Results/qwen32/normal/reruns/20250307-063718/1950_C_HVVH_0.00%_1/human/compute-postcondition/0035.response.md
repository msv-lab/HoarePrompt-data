Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n`, `h` is the input hour minus 12, `m` is the input minute as an integer, `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` is 0 or less than 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` is greater than 12 or if the original `h` is 12.**

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated to be the input hour minus 12, while all other variables retain their initial values.
