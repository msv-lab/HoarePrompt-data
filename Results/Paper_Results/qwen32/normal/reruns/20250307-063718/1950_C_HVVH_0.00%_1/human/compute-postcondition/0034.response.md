The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n`, `h` is 12, `m` is the input minute as an integer, `day` is 'AM'**.
