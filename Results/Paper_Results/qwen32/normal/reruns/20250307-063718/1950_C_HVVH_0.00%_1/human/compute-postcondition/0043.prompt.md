Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is `'AM'`, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the input minute as an integer. If `h` was originally 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is exactly 12, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n - 1`, `m` is the input minute as an integer, `h` is 12 if the original `h` is 0, otherwise `h` is the input hour as an integer minus 12 if the original `h` is greater than 12, and `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` is 0 or less than 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` is greater than 12 or if the original `h` is 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` remains `n`, `m` is the input minute as an integer. If `h` was 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, then `h` is the input hour minus 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` == 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
