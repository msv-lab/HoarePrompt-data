You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a time in 24-hour format "hh:mm". For each test case, it converts the time to 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This is fine as it defaults to AM for the first test case.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   - The program then enters a loop that processes each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the input string is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` (hours) is 0, it is set to 12, and `day` is set to 'AM'. This correctly handles midnight (00:00).
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to the equivalent 12-hour format by subtracting 12, and `day` is set to 'PM'. This correctly handles the PM period.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. This part is incorrect because 12:00 should be 'PM', but the logic incorrectly sets it to 'AM'. There is a misplaced `else` block that causes this issue.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` should be 'AM', but the current logic does not explicitly handle this case.

5. **Output**:
   - The converted time and the `day` are printed using an f-string with leading zeros for hours and minutes.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic to handle `h == 12` is incorrect. It should set `day` to 'PM' when `h == 12`, but the current implementation sets it to 'AM'.
- The logic for `h` between 1 and 11 is not explicitly handled, but it works due to the default `day` value being 'AM'. However, this is not robust and might lead to issues if the default `day` value changes.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issues, we need to adjust the logic for handling `h == 12` and ensure `day` is set correctly for all cases.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the `h == 12` case. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
