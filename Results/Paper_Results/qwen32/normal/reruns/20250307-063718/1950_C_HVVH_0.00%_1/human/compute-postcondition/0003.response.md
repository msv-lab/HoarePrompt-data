The code snippet takes an input in the format of hours and minutes separated by a colon, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `h` and `m`. The initial state of `t`, `s`, `day`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is `'AM'`, `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the input hour as an integer, `m` is the input minute as an integer.**
