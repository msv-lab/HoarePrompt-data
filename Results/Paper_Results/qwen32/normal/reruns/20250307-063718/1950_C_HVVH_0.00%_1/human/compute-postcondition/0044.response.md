Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The function returns the count of test cases where the time represented by `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards).**
