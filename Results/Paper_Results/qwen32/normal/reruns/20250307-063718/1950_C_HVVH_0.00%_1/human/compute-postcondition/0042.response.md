Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `n` remains `n` (its value is not specified, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `m` is the input minute as an integer.
- The hour `h` is derived from the string `s` and adjusted according to the following rules:
  - If `h` (from `s`) was 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` (from `s`) > 12, then `h` is the input hour minus 12 and `day` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` (from `s`) == 12, `day` is 'AM'.
  - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - The string `s` is in the format `HH:MM`, where `HH` is the hour and `MM` is the minute.
   - `h` is the hour part of `s` (extracted and converted to an integer).
   - `m` is the minute part of `s` (extracted and converted to an integer, already given in the initial state).

2. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12, and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` remains 'PM'.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that both `h` and `m` are printed as two-digit numbers, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
   - `day` is printed as a string ('AM' or 'PM').

### Output:
Given the above rules, the output will be a formatted time in 12-hour format followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **`hh:mm` AM/PM (where `hh` is the adjusted hour in 12-hour format and `mm` is the minute, and AM/PM is the corresponding period of the day)**

To be more specific, if we assume a concrete example:
- If `s` is "14:30", then `h` is 14, which is adjusted to 2, and `day` is 'PM'.
- The output will be "02:30 PM".

However, since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of the variables:

Output: **`hh:mm` AM/PM (where `hh` is the adjusted hour in 12-hour format and `mm` is the minute, and AM/PM is the corresponding period of the day)**
