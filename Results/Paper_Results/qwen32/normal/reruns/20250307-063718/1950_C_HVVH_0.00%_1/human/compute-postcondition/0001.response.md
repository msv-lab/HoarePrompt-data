The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, with `day` being `'AM'`. The value of `n` is obtained from the user input and is converted to an integer. The values of `t`, `s`, and `day` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is `'AM'`, `n` is an input integer.**
