The code snippet provided sets the variable `day` to `'AM'`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is `'AM'`, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the input minute as an integer.**
