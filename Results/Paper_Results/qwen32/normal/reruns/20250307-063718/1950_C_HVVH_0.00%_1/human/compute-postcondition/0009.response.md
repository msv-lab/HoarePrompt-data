Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is `'AM'`, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the input hour as an integer minus 12, and `m` is the input minute as an integer.**

In natural language: The value of `h` has been reduced by 12, while all other variables (`t`, `s`, `day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
