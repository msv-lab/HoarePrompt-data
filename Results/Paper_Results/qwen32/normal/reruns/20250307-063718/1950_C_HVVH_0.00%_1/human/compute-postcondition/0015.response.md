Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the input hour as an integer and `h` is less than or equal to 12, and `m` is the input minute as an integer. If `h` is equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**
