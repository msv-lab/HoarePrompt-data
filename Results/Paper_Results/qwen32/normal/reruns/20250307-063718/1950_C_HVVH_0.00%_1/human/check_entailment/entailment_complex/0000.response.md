### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python function step by step to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM indicator.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Converting Time:**
   - The function splits the time string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
   - It initializes the `day` variable to 'AM' by default.

3. **Adjusting Hours and Day:**
   - If `h` (hour) is 0:
     - It sets `h` to 12 and keeps `day` as 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12:
     - It subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'PM'. However, there is a special case when `h` is exactly 12, in which `day` should be 'PM' (not 'AM' as the code suggests in the `else` block). This part of the code is incorrect.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - It prints the time in the 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM indicator.

### Issues:
- The logic for setting `day` to 'AM' or 'PM' is incorrect in the `else` block. Specifically, when `h` is 12, it should be 'PM', not 'AM'.
- The current implementation incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we can adjust the `else` block as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the `day` variable when `h` is 12. Therefore, the Correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
