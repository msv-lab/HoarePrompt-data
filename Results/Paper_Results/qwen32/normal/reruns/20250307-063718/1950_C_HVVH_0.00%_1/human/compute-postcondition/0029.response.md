Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n - 1`, `m` is the input minute as an integer, `h` is 12 if the original `h` is 0, otherwise `h` is the input hour as an integer minus 12 if the original `h` is greater than 12, and `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` is 0 or less than 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` is greater than 12 or if the original `h` is 12.**
