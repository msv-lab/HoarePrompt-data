Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the input hour as an integer minus 12, and `m` is the input minute as an integer.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the variable `day` has been updated from `'AM'` to `'PM'`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
