Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n`, `m` is the input minute as an integer. If `h` > 12, then `h` is the input hour minus 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` == 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**
