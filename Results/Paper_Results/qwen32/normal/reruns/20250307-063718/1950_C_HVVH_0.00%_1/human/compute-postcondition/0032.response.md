The code snippet provided reads a string input representing a time in the format "HH:MM" and splits it into two integers, `h` and `m`, representing the hour and minute respectively. The initial state of `h` and `m` is overwritten by these new values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n`, `h` is the input hour as an integer, `m` is the input minute as an integer, `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` is 0 or less than 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` is greater than 12 or if the original `h` is 12.**

In simpler terms: The values of `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute read from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
