### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to ensure it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This is a good start, as most times will be AM unless specified otherwise.
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, the input string `s` in the format "hh:mm" is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Conversion Logic:**
   - If `h` (hour) is `0`, it represents midnight in 24-hour format. The program correctly converts `h` to `12` and sets `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it means the time is in the PM range. The program correctly converts `h` to `h - 12` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is exactly `12`, it represents noon in 24-hour format. The program correctly sets `day` to 'PM' initially but then overrides it to 'AM' if `h` is `12`. This is correct because 12:00 is noon, which is PM, but 12:00 AM is midnight, which is already handled by the `h == 0` case. Thus, the `else` block with `day = 'AM'` when `h == 12` is not necessary and can be omitted, but it does not cause an incorrect output in this case.
   - For all other values of `h` (i.e., `1` to `11`), `day` is set to 'PM' unless `h` is `12`, which is already handled.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" using Python's formatted string literals (`f-string`). The `:02d` ensures that the hour and minute are always two digits, preserving leading zeros where necessary.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules specified in the problem statement. It converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format accurately.

**Correctness: True**
