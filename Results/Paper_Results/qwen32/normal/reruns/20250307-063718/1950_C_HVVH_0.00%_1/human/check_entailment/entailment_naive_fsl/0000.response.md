Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in handling the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the handling of the hour `12` is incorrect. Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

This logic incorrectly sets the day to 'PM' first and then sets it to 'AM' if `h` is `12`. However, `12` in 24-hour format should be 'PM' in 12-hour format. The correct logic should be:

- If `h` is `0`, it should be `12 AM`.
- If `h` is `12`, it should be `12 PM`.
- If `h` is greater than `12`, it should be `h - 12 PM`.
- If `h` is between `1` and `11` (inclusive), it should be `h AM`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases correctly, including `00:00` (midnight), `12:00` (noon), and all other valid times in the 24-hour format.
