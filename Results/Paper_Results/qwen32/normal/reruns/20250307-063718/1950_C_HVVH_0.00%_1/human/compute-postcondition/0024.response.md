The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `day`. This change affects only the variable `day`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is `n - 1`, `h` is the input hour as an integer minus 12, `m` is the input minute as an integer, and `day` is `'PM'`.**
