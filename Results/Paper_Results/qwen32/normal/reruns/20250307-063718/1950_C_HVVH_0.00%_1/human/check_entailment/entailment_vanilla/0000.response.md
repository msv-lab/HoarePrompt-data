Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This is fine as it defaults to AM for the first test case.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   - The program then enters a loop that processes each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the input string is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` (hours) is 0, it is set to 12, and `day` is set to 'AM'. This correctly handles midnight (00:00).
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to the equivalent 12-hour format by subtracting 12, and `day` is set to 'PM'. This correctly handles the PM period.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. This part is incorrect because 12:00 should be 'PM', but the logic incorrectly sets it to 'AM'. There is a misplaced `else` block that causes this issue.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` should be 'AM', but the current logic does not explicitly handle this case.

5. **Output**:
   - The converted time and the `day` are printed using an f-string with leading zeros for hours and minutes.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic to handle `h == 12` is incorrect. It should set `day` to 'PM' when `h == 12`, but the current implementation sets it to 'AM'.
- The logic for `h` between 1 and 11 is not explicitly handled, but it works due to the default `day` value being 'AM'. However, this is not robust and might lead to issues if the default `day` value changes.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issues, we need to adjust the logic for handling `h == 12` and ensure `day` is set correctly for all cases.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the `h == 12` case. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
