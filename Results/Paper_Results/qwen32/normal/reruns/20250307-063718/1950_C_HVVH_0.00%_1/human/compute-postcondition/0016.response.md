Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the input hour as an integer, and `m` is the input minute as an integer. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is exactly 12, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.**
