To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables `h`, `m`, and `day`.

### Initial State and Transformations:
1. **`s`**: A string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (e.g., "13:45").
2. **`h`**: The hour component extracted from `s` (e.g., 13 from "13:45").
3. **`m`**: The minute component extracted from `s` (e.g., 45 from "13:45").
4. **`day`**: A string indicating whether the time is AM or PM.

### Transformations on `h` and `day`:
- If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is exactly 12, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `s` is "13:45", so `h` is 13 and `m` is 45.
- Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes `13 - 12 = 1` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- The `print` statement will then output `01:45 PM`.

Let's consider another example where `s` is "00:30", so `h` is 0 and `m` is 30.
- Since `h` is 0, `h` becomes 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- The `print` statement will then output `12:30 AM`.

### General Case:
- The `print` statement will format `h` and `m` to always be two digits using `:02d` and will print the `day` string.
- The exact values of `h` and `m` depend on the input string `s`, but the transformation rules for `h` and `day` are clearly defined.

### Final Output:
Given the transformations and the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be a formatted time string in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **`{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}` (where `h` is the transformed hour, `m` is the minute, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the transformation rules)**

Since the specific values of `h`, `m`, and `day` depend on the input `s`, we provide the general form of the output as described.
