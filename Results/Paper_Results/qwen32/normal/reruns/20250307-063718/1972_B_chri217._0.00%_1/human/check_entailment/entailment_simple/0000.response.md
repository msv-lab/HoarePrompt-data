### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of the coins. The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner when both players play optimally.

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of `'U'` characters in the string `s` and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns `'YES'` indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns `'NO'` indicating Bob wins.

The annotated comments in the program align with the expected behavior and correctly describe the state of the program before the function call and the return values based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
