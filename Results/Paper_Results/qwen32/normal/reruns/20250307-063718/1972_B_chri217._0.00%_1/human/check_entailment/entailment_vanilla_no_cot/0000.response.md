Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). According to the problem statement, Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if it is even, which aligns with the winning conditions described in the problem.
