You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of the characters "U" and "D" and returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the structure of the game and the implications of each player's moves. The key insight is to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The game starts with a certain number of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Each time a facing-up coin is removed, the number of facing-up coins changes due to the flipping of the adjacent coins.
   - If there are only two coins left and one is facing up, removing that coin leaves the other coin unchanged.
   - If there is only one coin left, no more flips occur.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The player who removes the last facing-up coin wins.
   - If a player cannot make a move (because there are no facing-up coins), they lose.

4. **Parity Analysis**:
   - The crucial observation is that the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains invariant modulo 2 throughout the game. This is because:
     - Removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins either:
       - Reduces the number of facing-up coins by 1 (if the adjacent coins are both down),
       - Reduces the number of facing-up coins by 3 (if the adjacent coins are both up),
       - Reduces the number of facing-up coins by 1 and increases by 1 (if one adjacent coin is up and the other is down).
     - In all cases, the parity of the number of facing-up coins changes.
   - Since Alice goes first, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even on Bob's turn. This ensures that Alice will be the one to remove the last facing-up coin and win.
   - Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where the number of facing-up coins is odd on Alice's turn, ensuring Bob will be the one to remove the last facing-up coin and win.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the count is odd (`num_up % 2 == 1`). If it is, Alice wins (`return 'YES'`); otherwise, Bob wins (`return 'NO'`).

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
