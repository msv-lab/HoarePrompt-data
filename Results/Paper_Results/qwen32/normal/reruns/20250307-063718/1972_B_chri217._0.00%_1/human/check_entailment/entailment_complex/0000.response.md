Reasoning: The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins ("U"). The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each move by a player reduces the number of facing-up coins by one, and the player who is forced to make a move when there are no facing-up coins left loses. Since Alice goes first, she will win if the initial count of facing-up coins is odd (as she will always be the one to make the last move in this scenario). Conversely, if the count is even, Bob will win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U" characters in the input string and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice's win; if the count is even, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob's win. This matches the required behavior as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
