Output State: **The program returns (x + b, y + b), where x is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), y is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd), and b is equal to the number of columns in the field.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of the number of lines in the field and the number of columns, and the second element is the sum of the number of columns and itself.
