Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of lines and columns in the field, respectively. It returns a tuple `(x + b, y + b)`, where `x` is the number of lines in the field (`a`), `y` is the number of columns in the field (`b`), and `b` is the number of columns in the field. Essentially, it returns `(a + b, b + b)`.**
