This problem description does not match the provided function definition `def add(a, b):`. The function definition suggests a simple addition function, while the problem description is about simulating a Quidditch game. Assuming the task is to implement the Quidditch game as described, the input variables would be: N and M are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd); the field is a 2D list of strings of size N x M, where each string can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B"; T is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000); and the next T lines contain actions which are strings formatted as described in the problem.
