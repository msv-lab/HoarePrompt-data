#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd). The field is described by a list of a strings, each containing b pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. There is exactly one Quaffle ('.Q') and zero or one Bludger ('.B') on the field. Each team (R for red, B for blue) has between 1 and 10 players, and each team has between 1 and 5 goals ('RG' for red goals and 'BG' for blue goals). The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action is either a move (U, D, L, R), a catch (C), or a throw (T) of the Quaffle.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + b, y + b), where x is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), y is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd), and b is equal to the number of columns in the field.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the number of lines and columns in a field, respectively. It returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of `a` and `b`, and the second element is twice the value of `b`.
