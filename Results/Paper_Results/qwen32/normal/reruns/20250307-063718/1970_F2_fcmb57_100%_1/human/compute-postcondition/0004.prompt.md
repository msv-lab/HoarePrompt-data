You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd). The field is described by a list of a strings, each containing b pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. There is exactly one Quaffle ('.Q') and zero or one Bludger ('.B') on the field. Each team (R for red, B for blue) has between 1 and 10 players, and each team has between 1 and 5 goals ('RG' for red goals and 'BG' for blue goals). The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action is either a move (U, D, L, R), a catch (C), or a throw (T) of the Quaffle.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + b, y + b), where x is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), y is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd), and b is equal to the number of columns in the field.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of lines and columns in the field, respectively. It returns a tuple `(x + b, y + b)`, where `x` is the number of lines in the field (`a`), `y` is the number of columns in the field (`b`), and `b` is the number of columns in the field. Essentially, it returns `(a + b, b + b)`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (x + b, y + b), where x is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd), y is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd), and b is equal to the number of columns in the field.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
