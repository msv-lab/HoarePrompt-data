Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program contains several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Handling Quaffle Catching and Throwing**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` does not assign the player to the Quaffle. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to indicate that the player is now carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Checking Goals**: The conditions for checking goals are not mutually exclusive. The program should use `elif` instead of `if` for the second goal check to avoid incorrect double counting of points. Additionally, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle regardless of which team scores.

3. **Incorrect Quaffle Resetting**: When a player scores in their own goal, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, but the current code incorrectly resets it to the player's position.

4. **Bludger Handling**: The program correctly identifies and eliminates players who come into contact with the Bludger, but it should also handle the case where the Bludger moves to a player's position.

5. **Sorting Eliminations**: The program sorts eliminations correctly, but it should ensure that the sorting is done only when necessary (i.e., when multiple players are eliminated at the same time).

Here is the corrected version of the program with these issues addressed:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version should now handle all the requirements and constraints of the problem correctly.
