You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

    #State: All test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of selling all `n` buns, considering that the first bun is sold at the modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain. Let's analyze the code and the problem description.

The key part of the problem is to determine the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The code provided does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all possible values of `k`.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
if b <= a:
    print(n * a)
elif b - a >= n:
    print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
else:
    print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

Let's break down the conditions and see if they cover all cases:

1. `if b <= a`:
   - This correctly handles the case where the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`. In this case, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.

2. `elif b - a >= n`:
   - This condition is intended to handle the case where the difference between the modified price and the usual price is large enough that selling all buns at the modified price is optimal. However, the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` does not correctly compute the sum of the modified prices for the first `n` buns. The correct formula should be the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * b - (n * (n - 1)) / 2`.

3. `else`:
   - This part of the code is incorrect. The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly compute the maximum profit. The optimal `k` should be determined by comparing the profit for different values of `k`, not by this formula.

Let's consider a test case:
```
Input:
1
5 5 9

Expected Output:
35

Actual Output (from the provided code):
25
```

In this case, the code incorrectly calculates the profit. The correct profit is obtained by selling all buns at the modified price, which is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over possible values of `k` and compute the profit for each `k`, then choose the maximum profit.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (b - k + 1) * k if k <= b else (2 * b - k + 1) * k // 2
            profit += a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code iterates over all possible values of `k` and computes the profit for each `k`, then chooses the maximum profit. This ensures that the code handles all potential cases correctly.
