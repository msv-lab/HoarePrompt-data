To determine the output of the print statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the given initial state.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

Let's analyze the components of this expression:

1. **`(b - a)`**: This is the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b` and `a` are integers, `b - a` is also an integer.

2. **`(b - a + 1)`**: This is the difference between `b` and `a` plus one. It represents the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.

3. **`(b - a) / 2`**: This division is performed in Python, which means it will result in a float if the division is not exact. However, the result is immediately cast to an integer using `int()`, so the fractional part is discarded.

4. **`int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1))`**: This part calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers starting from `a`, scaled by `(b - a + 1)`. The division by 2 and the multiplication by `(b - a + 1)` are combined to form a specific sum formula.

5. **`a * n`**: This part multiplies the integer `a` by `n`, which is another integer.

6. **`int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**: Finally, the two parts calculated above are added together, and the result is cast to an integer.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is the number of test cases and is greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values between 1 and \(10^9\).
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` calculates a specific value based on the difference between `b` and `a`, and the value of `n`. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, `a` and `n` are integers as defined in the initial state)**
