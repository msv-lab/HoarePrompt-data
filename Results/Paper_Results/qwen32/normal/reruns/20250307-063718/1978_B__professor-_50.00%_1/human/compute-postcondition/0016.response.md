To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step based on the provided initial state.

The expression inside the `print` function is:
```python
int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)
```

Let's analyze the components:

1. **`b - a`**: This represents the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b` and `a` are integers, the result of this subtraction is also an integer.

2. **`(b - a) / 2`**: This is the division of the difference `b - a` by 2. Since we are using integer division (`int()` function), the result will be an integer. If `b - a` is odd, the division will truncate the decimal part.

3. **`(b - a + 1)`**: This is the difference `b - a` incremented by 1.

4. **`(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`**: This is the product of the two expressions calculated above. The result is an integer.

5. **`a * n`**: This is the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` and `n` are integers, so the result is also an integer.

6. **`int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**: This is the sum of the two products calculated above, and the result is converted to an integer (though it is already an integer due to the operations involved).

The expression essentially calculates a value based on the difference `b - a` and the number of test cases `n`. The formula seems to be related to summing a sequence of numbers starting from `a` and ending at `b` (if `b` is greater than `a`), and then adjusting by the number of test cases `n`.

**Output Description**:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This value is calculated based on the difference between `b` and `a`, and the number of test cases `n`.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where b and a are integers between 1 and 10^9, and n is the number of test cases)**
