To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the expression inside it and the conditions provided in the initial state.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

Let's break down the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases, greater than 0.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 10^9.
   - `a`: An integer between 1 and 10^9.
   - `b`: An integer between 1 and 10^9, with the condition that if `b < a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`. If `b > a`, the difference `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is a mathematical formula: \((2 \times b - n + 1) \times n / 2\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `2 * b - n + 1` and the number of terms is `n`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with `n` terms.
   - The result of this calculation is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

Given the conditions, we can't determine the exact numerical value without specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **The result of the integer division of the product of (2 * b - n + 1) and n by 2 (where n, a, and b are integers provided in the input)**

In simpler terms, the output is the integer value of the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with `n` terms.

Output: **The integer value of ((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
