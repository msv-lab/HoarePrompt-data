The given code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are described in the initial state but are not yet assigned values in the provided code. The variable `t` is the only one that is explicitly modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^9, and there are `t` such test cases.**
