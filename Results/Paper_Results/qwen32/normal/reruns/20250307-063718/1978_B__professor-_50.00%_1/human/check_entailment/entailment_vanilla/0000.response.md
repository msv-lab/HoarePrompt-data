Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
Bob sells `n` buns. For the first `k` buns, he uses a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i`-th bun. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to find the maximum profit he can obtain.

### Key Observations
1. **If `b <= a`**: Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option because the modified price `(b - i + 1)` would always be less than or equal to `a`.
2. **If `b - a >= n`**: This means the price drop `(b - i + 1)` for the first `n` buns is always greater than or equal to `a`. Therefore, selling all `n` buns at the modified price is optimal. The total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - n + 1)`.
3. **Otherwise**: We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`, and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program to see if it handles all cases correctly:

1. **Case `b <= a`**:
   - The program correctly outputs `n * a` which is the profit when all buns are sold at the usual price.
   
2. **Case `b - a >= n`**:
   - The program correctly calculates the profit for selling all `n` buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   
3. **Otherwise**:
   - The program's logic here seems incorrect. The formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` does not correctly compute the maximum profit for the case where `b - a < n`. The correct approach would involve finding the optimal `k` by iterating through possible values or using a mathematical approach to determine the maximum sum of the series plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the program does not handle the "Otherwise" case correctly. It does not find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Instead, it uses a formula that does not account for the correct series sum and the remaining buns' profit.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
