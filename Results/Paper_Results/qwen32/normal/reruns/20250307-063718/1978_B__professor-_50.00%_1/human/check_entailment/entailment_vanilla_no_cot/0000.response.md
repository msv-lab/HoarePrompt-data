Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all scenarios. Let's break down the issues:

1. **When `b <= a`:** 
   - The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.

2. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - The program calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is correct for the scenario where the modified price starts from `b` and decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun up to `n` buns. However, this formula assumes that the modified price can go negative, which is not valid. The correct formula should be `int((b + (b - n + 1)) * n / 2)` to ensure the price does not go below 1.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - The program calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price. The correct approach is to calculate the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and choosing the `k` that maximizes the profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, keeping track of the maximum profit found.
