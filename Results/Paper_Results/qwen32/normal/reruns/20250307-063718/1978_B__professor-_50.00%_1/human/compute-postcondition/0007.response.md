Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The current value of `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\).
   
2. **Substitute and Simplify**:
   - Let's denote the expression as \(E = (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\).
   - This expression calculates a specific value based on the given variables `b`, `n`, and implicitly `a` (since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`).

3. **Understanding the Expression**:
   - The expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\) can be seen as the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \(2 * b - n + 1\) and the number of terms is \(n\), but it's divided by 2.
   - The term \(2 * b - n + 1\) represents a specific starting point for the series, and \(n\) is the number of terms in this series.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final value printed will be the integer part of \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\).

### Output Description:
The code calculates the value of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\) and prints the integer part of this value.

### Final Output:
Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
