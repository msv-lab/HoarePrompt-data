Output State: **All test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all `t` iterations, each test case has been evaluated, and the corresponding output for each test case has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated to reflect the values from the last test case, but the loop itself will have finished executing. The initial value of `t` will have been decremented to 0, indicating that no more test cases remain to be processed.
