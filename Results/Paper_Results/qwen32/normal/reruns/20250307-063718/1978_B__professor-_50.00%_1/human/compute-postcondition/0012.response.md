The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as the range is not exhausted, which means it will continue as long as `_` has not reached `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` would have taken on a value from 0 to `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^9. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.**
