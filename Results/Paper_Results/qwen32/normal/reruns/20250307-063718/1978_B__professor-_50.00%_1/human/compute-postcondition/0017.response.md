Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^9, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided in the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. The program checks if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. If true, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes, but in both parts, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as described are maintained.**
