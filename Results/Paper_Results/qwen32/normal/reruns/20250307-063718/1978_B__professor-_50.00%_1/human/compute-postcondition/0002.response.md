The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated based on the input, but `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^9 as read from the input.**
