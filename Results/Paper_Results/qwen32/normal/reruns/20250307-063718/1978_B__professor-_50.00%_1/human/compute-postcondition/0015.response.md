To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression and understand how the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are used.

The expression to be evaluated is:
```
int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)
```

### Breakdown of the Expression:
1. **2 * b**: This part of the expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2.
2. **- n**: This subtracts the value of `n` from the result of `2 * b`.
3. **+ 1**: This adds 1 to the result of the previous operations.
4. **(2 * b - n + 1) * n**: This multiplies the result of the previous operations by `n`.
5. **/ 2**: This divides the result of the multiplication by 2.
6. **int(...)**: This converts the final result to an integer.

### Conditions on `n`, `a`, and `b`:
- `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values between 1 and 10^9.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

### Analysis:
The expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` calculates a value based on the provided `n` and `b`. Since `a` is not directly used in the expression, we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

Given the conditions:
- `n` and `b` are both integers between 1 and 10^9.
- The expression itself does not impose any further constraints on `n` and `b` beyond their ranges.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement is the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Answer:
Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where n and b are integers provided as input)**
