You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
Bob sells `n` buns. For the first `k` buns, he uses a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i`-th bun. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to find the maximum profit he can obtain.

### Key Observations
1. **If `b <= a`**: Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option because the modified price `(b - i + 1)` would always be less than or equal to `a`.
2. **If `b - a >= n`**: This means the price drop `(b - i + 1)` for the first `n` buns is always greater than or equal to `a`. Therefore, selling all `n` buns at the modified price is optimal. The total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - n + 1)`.
3. **Otherwise**: We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`, and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program to see if it handles all cases correctly:

1. **Case `b <= a`**:
   - The program correctly outputs `n * a` which is the profit when all buns are sold at the usual price.
   
2. **Case `b - a >= n`**:
   - The program correctly calculates the profit for selling all `n` buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   
3. **Otherwise**:
   - The program's logic here seems incorrect. The formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` does not correctly compute the maximum profit for the case where `b - a < n`. The correct approach would involve finding the optimal `k` by iterating through possible values or using a mathematical approach to determine the maximum sum of the series plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the program does not handle the "Otherwise" case correctly. It does not find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Instead, it uses a formula that does not account for the correct series sum and the remaining buns' profit.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
