Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what it prints based on the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, each with values between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **Calculate \(b - a\)**:
   - This is the difference between `b` and `a`, which is a positive integer since `b > a`.

2. **Calculate \((b - a) / 2\)**:
   - This is the integer division of the difference by 2. Since both `b` and `a` are integers, the result of this division will also be an integer (due to the `int()` function).

3. **Calculate \((b - a + 1)\)**:
   - This is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **Calculate \((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)\)**:
   - This is the product of the two previous calculations. It represents the sum of the first \(b - a\) integers, starting from 1, scaled by \((b - a) / 2\).

5. **Calculate \(a * n\)**:
   - This is the product of `a` and `n`.

6. **Sum the two results**:
   - The final result is the sum of the two products calculated above.

### Final Output Description:
The expression inside the `print` statement calculates a specific sum based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. Given the constraints, the printed value is a precise integer result of the formula:

\[
\text{Output} = \left(\frac{b - a}{2}\right) \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n
\]

This formula essentially computes a modified sum involving the difference between `b` and `a` and the value of `a` scaled by `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **\(\left(\frac{b - a}{2}\right) \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n\) (where \(b - a\) is the difference between \(b\) and \(a\), and \(a\) and \(n\) are given integers)**

This is the most precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
