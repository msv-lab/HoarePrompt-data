The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of the list `a`. This means that the first element of `a` becomes the last, the second element becomes the second last, and so on. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `sums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
