To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **n**: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **k**: The second integer from the input, representing the number of iterations in the loop.
4. **x**: The third integer from the input, which is not used directly in the provided code snippet.
5. **a**: A list of integers obtained from the input in descending order.
6. **sum1**: The sum of the list `a`.
7. **ans**: A list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element is the computed `sums` value after each iteration of the loop.
8. **sums**: The value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is a list of length `k + 1`, where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration.
- `max(ans)` will find the maximum value in the list `ans`.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **sums** is computed in each iteration of a loop that runs `k + 1` times.
- The value of `sums` changes in each iteration, but `ans` stores each of these values.
- The final `print(max(ans))` statement will output the maximum value stored in the list `ans`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value found in the list `ans` after all iterations.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of sums computed in each iteration of the loop)**
