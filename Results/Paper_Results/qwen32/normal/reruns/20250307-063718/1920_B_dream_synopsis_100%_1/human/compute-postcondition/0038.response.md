To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and updates the variables based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates `k + 1` times, updating the `sums` variable and appending it to the `ans` list according to the rules specified. Let's break down the loop logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` when `i` is 0.
   - `ans` is an empty list that gets populated with the values of `sums` in each iteration.

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For `i > 0` and `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - For `i > 0` and `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates after `k + 1` iterations, meaning `i` ranges from `0` to `k`.

**Output State Calculation**:
- The final `ans` list will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing a computed `sums` value.
- The final value of `sums` will be the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).

Let's summarize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing a computed `sums` value based on the loop logic.
- `sums` will be the last computed value in the loop.

Given this understanding, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed `sums` value after each iteration of the loop, and `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `ans` list will have `k + 1` computed values, and `sums` will hold the last computed value from the loop.
