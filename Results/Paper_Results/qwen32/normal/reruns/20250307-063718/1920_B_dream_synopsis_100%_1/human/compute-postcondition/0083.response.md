The code snippet provided sorts the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, or `sums`. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
