Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 2`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

In simple terms: The value of `sums` has been updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
