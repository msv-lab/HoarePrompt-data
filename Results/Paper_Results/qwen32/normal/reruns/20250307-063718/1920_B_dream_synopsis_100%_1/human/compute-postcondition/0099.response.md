Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains a single element `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
