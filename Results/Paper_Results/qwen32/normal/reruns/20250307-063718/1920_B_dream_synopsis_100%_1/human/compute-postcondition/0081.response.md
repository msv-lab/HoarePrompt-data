The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This snippet does not affect the other variables `t`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, or `sums`. The output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
