Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is not 0; and `i + x - 1 < n`.**

In simple terms, the list `ans` now contains the value of `sums`, which was computed using the formula `sums = (value from last iteration) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
