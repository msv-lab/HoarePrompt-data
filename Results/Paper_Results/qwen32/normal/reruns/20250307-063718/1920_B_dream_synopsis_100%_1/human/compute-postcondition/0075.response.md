The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This means that `ans` will now have an additional element, which is the current value of `sums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `sums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.**
