The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `a`. Since `a` is initially a sorted list of integers, after reversing, it will be in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order.**
