The code snippet provided appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `ans` will now include the value of `sums` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that now includes `sums` as its last element, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
