The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `a` from these integers.

Given the initial state, `a` was a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order. After executing the code snippet, the list `a` will be reassigned to a new list of integers read from the input, but the order of these integers is not specified by the code snippet itself. Therefore, `a` will lose its previous value and be updated to the new list of integers.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) are not affected by this specific code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed `sums` value after each iteration of the loop; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
