The code snippet provided appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are updated in this specific code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the current `sums` value to the `ans` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that now contains the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
