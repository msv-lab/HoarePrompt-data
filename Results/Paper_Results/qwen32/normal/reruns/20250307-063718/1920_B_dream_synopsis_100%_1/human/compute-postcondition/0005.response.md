The code calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`.**
