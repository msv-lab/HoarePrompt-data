The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now include `sums` as its last element. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that now includes `sums` as its last element, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.
