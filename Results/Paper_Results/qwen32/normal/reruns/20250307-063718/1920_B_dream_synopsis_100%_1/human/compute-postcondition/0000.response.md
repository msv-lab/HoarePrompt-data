The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specified number of times based on the value of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the input value (which is converted to an integer) is at least 1. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and is within the valid range (1 to 10,000), we need to ensure that the input value matches `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value must be equal to `t`**
