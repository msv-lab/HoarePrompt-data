The code snippet appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` was an empty list. After the code execution, `ans` now contains one element, which is `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, and the current value of `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
