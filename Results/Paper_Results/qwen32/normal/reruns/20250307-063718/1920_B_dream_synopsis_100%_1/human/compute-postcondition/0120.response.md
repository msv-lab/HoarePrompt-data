Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; the loop has executed `t` times, where for each execution, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each computed as described above, and `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`). The final output of the loop is the maximum value from `ans` for each of the `t` test cases.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 (indicating no more iterations left). For each of the `t` test cases, the loop processes the input values `n`, `k`, and `x`, sorts the array `a` in descending order, computes the `sum1` as the total sum of `a`, and then iterates `k + 1` times to compute the `sums` for each possible scenario. The `ans` list stores these computed sums, and the maximum value from `ans` is printed for each test case.
