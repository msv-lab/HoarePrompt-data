Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains one element `sums`, where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i` was 0, `ans` now contains two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1`. If `i` was not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i` was originally 0, `ans` contains `sums` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` includes `sums` as its last element, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `ans` includes the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
