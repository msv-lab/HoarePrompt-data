The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now include `sums` as its last element, in addition to whatever elements it previously contained. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that includes `sums` as its last element, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
