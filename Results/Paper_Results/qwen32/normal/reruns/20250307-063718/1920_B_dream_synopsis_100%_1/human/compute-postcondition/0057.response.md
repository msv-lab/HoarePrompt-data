The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `ans` will now include the value of `sums` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `sums`; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]`; `i` is not 0; `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`**.
