The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and the input value must be equal to `t`. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are determined by the input, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input.**
