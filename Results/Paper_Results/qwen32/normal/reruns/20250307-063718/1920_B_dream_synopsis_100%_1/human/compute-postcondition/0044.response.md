The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the sorted list `a`. This means that the order of elements in `a` is flipped. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed `sums` value after each iteration of the loop; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**

In natural language: The list `a` is now reversed, while all other variables remain the same.
