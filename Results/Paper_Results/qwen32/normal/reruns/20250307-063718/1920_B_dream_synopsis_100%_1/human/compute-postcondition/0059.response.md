Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is either 0 or not 0. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains `sums` which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i != 0`, then `ans` contains `sums` which is updated based on the value of `i` and `x`. Specifically, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration plus `a[i - 1]`.**
