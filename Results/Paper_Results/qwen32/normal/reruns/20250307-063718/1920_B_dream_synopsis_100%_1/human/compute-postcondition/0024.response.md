Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list that now contains the value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1. `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `sums` has been updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
