The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or not 0, and `k` is at least 0.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `i` is either 0 or not 0 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was not 0, it will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we know `i` is incremented by 1, we can specify the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is 1 if the previous `i` was 0, otherwise `i` is `i + 1`**.

For simplicity, if we denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`, the state can be written as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since `i_prev` is not a variable in the loop head, we simply denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
