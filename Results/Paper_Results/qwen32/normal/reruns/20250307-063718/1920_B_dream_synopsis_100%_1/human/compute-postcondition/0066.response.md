The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This means that `ans` will now contain the previous value of `sums` as its last element. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` now includes the new value `sums`.**
