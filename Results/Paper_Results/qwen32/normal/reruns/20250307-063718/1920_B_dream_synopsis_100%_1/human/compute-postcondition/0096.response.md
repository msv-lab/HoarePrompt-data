Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]`; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`.**

In natural language: The value of `sums` has been updated to include the element `a[i - 1]` from the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
