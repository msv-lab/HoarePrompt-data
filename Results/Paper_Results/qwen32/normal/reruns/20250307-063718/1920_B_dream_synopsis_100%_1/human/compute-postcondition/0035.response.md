The code snippet provided appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, the value of `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i-1]`. Therefore, `ans` will now include this new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list that now includes the current value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i-1]`.**
