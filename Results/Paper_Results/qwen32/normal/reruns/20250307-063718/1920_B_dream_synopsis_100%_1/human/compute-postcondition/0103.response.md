To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet and see how it affects the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Let's break it down:
- `sums` is being updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, so `i` is used as `i + 1` in the list indexing.
- `x` is a third integer input.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0.
- `x` is the third integer from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order.
- `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`.
- `ans` is a list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before this line.

After the code snippet runs, the new value of `sums` will be:
```
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and the updated `i`) remain unchanged except for `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
