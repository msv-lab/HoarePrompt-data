The code snippet appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that now includes `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
