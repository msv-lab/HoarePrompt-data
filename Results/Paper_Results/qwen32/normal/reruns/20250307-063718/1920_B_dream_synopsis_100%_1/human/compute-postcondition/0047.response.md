The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `k + 1` is greater than 0, which means `k` must be at least 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 as it is the starting point of the range.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` must be at least 0, and `i` should be set to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`); `i` is 0**
