The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains one more element, which is the current value of `sums`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 2`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
