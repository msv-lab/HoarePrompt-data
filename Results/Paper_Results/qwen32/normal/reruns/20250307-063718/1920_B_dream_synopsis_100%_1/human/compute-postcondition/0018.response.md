Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
