The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. Given that the loop iterates over `range(k + 1)`, `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 2`.**
