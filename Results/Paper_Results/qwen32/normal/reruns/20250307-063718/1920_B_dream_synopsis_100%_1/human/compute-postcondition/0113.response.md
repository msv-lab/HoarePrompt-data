The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` already includes `sums` as its last element. After the execution of `ans.append(sums)`, `ans` will have `sums` appended again, making the last two elements of `ans` both equal to `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that includes `sums` as its last two elements, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
