The given code snippet is:

```python
ans = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
