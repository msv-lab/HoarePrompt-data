The code snippet provided is:

```python
ans = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. Therefore, `ans` is no longer a list containing `k + 1` elements but is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
