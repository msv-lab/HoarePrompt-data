Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 2`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

In natural language: The value of `sums` is now calculated as `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
