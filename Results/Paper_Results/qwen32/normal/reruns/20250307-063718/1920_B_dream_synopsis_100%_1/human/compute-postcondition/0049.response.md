The code snippet calculates the new value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is 0 and the condition `i == 0` is true.**

In simple terms, `sums` has been updated to be the original `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
