To determine the output of the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

1. **t**: An integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1. This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
2. **n**: The first integer from the input, which represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **k**: The second integer from the input, which indicates the number of iterations to perform.
4. **x**: The third integer from the input, which is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **a**: A reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input. This means that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
6. **sum1**: The sum of all elements in the list `a`.
7. **ans**: A list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in this list represents the value of `sums` after each iteration.
8. **sums**: The value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`). This value is the sum of the `k + 1` largest elements in the list `a`.

Given that `ans` is a list of sums after each iteration, and `sums` is the final value in this list (when `i = k`), the `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value in the `ans` list. Since `ans` contains sums of increasing numbers of elements from the largest to the smallest in `a`, the maximum value in `ans` will be the last element of `ans`, which is `sums`.

Thus, the `print(max(ans))` statement will print the value of `sums`, which is the sum of the `k + 1` largest elements in the reversed sorted list `a`.

Output: **sums (where sums is the sum of the k + 1 largest elements in the reversed sorted list `a`)**
