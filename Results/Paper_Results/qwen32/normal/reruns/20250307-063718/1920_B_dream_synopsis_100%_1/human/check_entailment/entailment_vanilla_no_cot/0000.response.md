Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program does not correctly implement this strategy. It does not consider removing elements from the sorted array correctly.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should minimize the sum by turning the largest remaining elements negative. The program does not correctly implement this strategy either. It incorrectly calculates the sum changes by only considering the first `x` elements and does not update the array properly after Alice's removals.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes up to k smallest elements
        if k >= n:
            print(0)
            continue
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips up to x elements to minimize the sum
        a.sort()
        flips = min(x, len(a))
        for i in range(flips):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Alice removes the smallest `k` elements.
- Bob flips the smallest `x` elements (after Alice's removal) to minimize the sum.
