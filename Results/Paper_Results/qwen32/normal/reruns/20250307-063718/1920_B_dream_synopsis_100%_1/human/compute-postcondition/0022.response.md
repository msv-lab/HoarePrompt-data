The provided code snippet attempts to append a variable `sums` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `sums` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. This would normally result in a `NameError` in Python. Assuming there was a typo and the intention was to append `sum1` instead of `sums`, the output state would be calculated as follows:

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans` because `sums` is not defined. If we assume `sums` was meant to be `sum1`, the new element in `ans` would be `sum1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` now contains two elements: the first is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and the second is `sum1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
