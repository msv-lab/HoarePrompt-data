Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
