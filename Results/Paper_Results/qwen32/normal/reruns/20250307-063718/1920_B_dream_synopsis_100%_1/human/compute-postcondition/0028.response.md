Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i` was 0, `ans` now contains two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1`. If `i` was not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
