The code sorts the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
