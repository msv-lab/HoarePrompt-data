Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
