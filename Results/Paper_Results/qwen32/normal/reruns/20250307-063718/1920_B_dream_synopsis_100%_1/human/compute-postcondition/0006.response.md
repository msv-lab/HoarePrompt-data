The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are modified, and the initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.**
