The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans` have certain values or states. After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed `sums` value after each iteration of the loop; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.
