The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `sums`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]); `i` is 0 and the condition `i == 0` is true.**
