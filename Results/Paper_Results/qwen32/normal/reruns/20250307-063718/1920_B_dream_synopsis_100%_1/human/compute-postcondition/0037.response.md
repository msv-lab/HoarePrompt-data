Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i` was originally 0, `ans` contains `sums` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` includes `sums` as its last element, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `ans` includes the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i-1]`.**
