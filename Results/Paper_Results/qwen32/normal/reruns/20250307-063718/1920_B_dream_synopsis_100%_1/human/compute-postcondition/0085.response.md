The code snippet `sum1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns this value to `sum1`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order, its sum remains the same regardless of its order.

Given the initial state, `sum1` is recalculated as the sum of the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, and `sums`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
