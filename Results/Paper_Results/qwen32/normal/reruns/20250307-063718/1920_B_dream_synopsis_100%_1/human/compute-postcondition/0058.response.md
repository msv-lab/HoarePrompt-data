Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is not 0. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]`.**
