The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and the initial state of `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now includes `sums` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
