The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
