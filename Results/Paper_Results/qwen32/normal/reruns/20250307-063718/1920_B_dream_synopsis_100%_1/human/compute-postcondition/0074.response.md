The code snippet provided modifies the value of `sums` by adding the element at the index `i - 1` from the list `a` to it. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this operation. The variable `i` is already defined as `i + 2` in the initial state, so we do not need to adjust it further in this context.

Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `a[i - 1]` refers to the element at the position `i - 1` in this list. Since `i` is `i + 2` in the initial state, the element being added to `sums` is the one at position `i + 1` in the original sequence of `a` before it was reversed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.**
