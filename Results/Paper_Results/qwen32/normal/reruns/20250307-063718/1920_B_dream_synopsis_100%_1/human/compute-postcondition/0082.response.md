The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the list `a`. This means the previous definition of `a` as a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input is no longer accurate, as the new `a` is just a list of integers in the order they were read.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
