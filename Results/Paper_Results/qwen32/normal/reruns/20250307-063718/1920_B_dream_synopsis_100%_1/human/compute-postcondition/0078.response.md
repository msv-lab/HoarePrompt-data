To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for `i` ranging from 0 to `k`. The loop updates the `sums` variable based on the conditions and appends it to the `ans` list in each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization (i = 0):**
   - `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - This value is appended to `ans`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations (i = 1 to k):**
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
   - The updated `sums` is then appended to `ans`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop runs `k + 1` times (from `i = 0` to `i = k`).
- The `ans` list will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.
- The final value of `sums` after the loop ends is the last element in the `ans` list.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each computed as described above.
- `sums` contains the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop finishes executing all `k + 1` iterations, the `ans` list will have `k + 1` elements. Each element in the list represents the cumulative sum computed according to the loop's logic. The final value of `sums` will be the last element in the `ans` list, representing the state after the last iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial values.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`).**
