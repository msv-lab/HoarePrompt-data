The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is a list that includes `sums` as its last element, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
