The code snippet provided appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `sums`. All other variables retain their previous values.
