The code snippet provided appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by adding a new element to it, but it does not change the values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, or `sums`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input but in reverse order; `sum1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `sums` is the value computed in the last iteration (when `i = k`) plus `a[i - 1]`; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`.**
