Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is either `1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `2 * math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value, while `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
