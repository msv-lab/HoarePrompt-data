Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The core of the problem is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for every bit position, the count of numbers with that bit set is even.

The numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. Their binary representations are:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

For the XOR of the sequence to be zero, the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position must be even. Specifically:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1 and 3) must be even.
- The count of numbers with the middle bit set (2 and 3) must be even.
- The count of numbers with the most significant bit set (4) must be even.

### Strategy:
Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, which means she should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as many times as possible. This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that the parity (odd/even) of the counts of numbers with each bit set remains even as often as possible.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the count `cnt` because removing one number from each of these groups will make their counts even, allowing Bob to win once initially.
2. Adding half of each count (rounded down) to `cnt`. This is because each pair of identical numbers can be removed without changing the parity of the counts of numbers with each bit set.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** 1 1 1 0
   - Counts: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
   - All three counts are odd, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - No pairs to remove.
   - **Output:** 1

2. **Input:** 1 0 1 2
   - Counts: 1 (1s), 0 (2s), 1 (3s), 2 (4s)
   - All three counts are not odd, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
   - Pairs: 1 pair of 4s can be removed.
   - **Output:** 1

3. **Input:** 2 2 2 0
   - Counts: 2 (1s), 2 (2s), 2 (3s), 0 (4s)
   - All three counts are not odd, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
   - Pairs: 1 pair of 1s, 1 pair of 2s, 1 pair of 3s can be removed.
   - **Output:** 3

4. **Input:** 3 3 2 0
   - Counts: 3 (1s), 3 (2s), 2 (3s), 0 (4s)
   - All three counts are not odd, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
   - Pairs: 1 pair of 1s, 1 pair of 2s can be removed.
   - **Output:** 3

5. **Input:** 0 9 9 9
   - Counts: 0 (1s), 9 (2s), 9 (3s), 9 (4s)
   - All three counts are not odd, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
   - Pairs: 4 pairs of 2s, 4 pairs of 3s, 4 pairs of 4s can be removed.
   - **Output:** 12

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
