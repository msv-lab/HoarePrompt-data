The value of `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` again, where `x` is `a[3]`. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `math.floor(a[3] / 2)`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` twice, `x` is `a[3]`**.
