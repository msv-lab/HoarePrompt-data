The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current element in the list `a`, and `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element.

Since `x` is the current element at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
