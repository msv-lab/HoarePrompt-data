The code snippet provided sets the variable `cnt` to 0. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the initial state of `cnt` is not recalculated in this snippet. Since `cnt` is explicitly set to 0, its value changes from whatever it was to 0. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is 0.**
