The provided code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `a`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, and `a` remains a list of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, `cnt` is 0**.
