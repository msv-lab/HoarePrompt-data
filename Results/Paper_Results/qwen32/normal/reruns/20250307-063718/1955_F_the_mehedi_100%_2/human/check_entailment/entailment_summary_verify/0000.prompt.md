You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the first three counts are odd; if so, it adds one to the count. Then, it adds half of each count (rounded down) to this value. The function outputs this calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
- The sequence consists of integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- For each test case, we are given the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

### Key Observations:
- The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each number contributing to a specific bit position is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are:
  - 1: 0001
  - 2: 0010
  - 3: 0011
  - 4: 0100
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero after each removal.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments the count by 1.
2. Adding half of each count (rounded down) to the count.

Let's verify if this logic is correct.

### Verification:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the initial XOR will be non-zero (since 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1), and removing one of these will make the XOR zero. Thus, Bob can win once in this scenario.
   
2. **General Case**:
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), the number of times Bob can win is determined by how many pairs (even counts) can be formed. Half of the counts (rounded down) represent the number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero.

### Test Cases:
Let's test the provided program against some edge cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Initial XOR is non-zero (1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1).
   - Eve can remove one of the 1s to make the XOR zero.
   - Expected output: 1
   - Program output: 1 (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Initial XOR is non-zero (1 XOR 1 = 0, but 2 contributes to the XOR).
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the XOR zero.
   - Expected output: 1
   - Program output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Initial XOR is zero (2 XOR 2 XOR 2 = 0).
   - Eve can remove pairs of 2s to keep the XOR zero.
   - Expected output: 3 (2 pairs of 2s can be removed)
   - Program output: 3 (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Initial XOR is non-zero (3 XOR 3 XOR 2 = 2).
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the XOR zero.
   - Expected output: 3 (3 pairs can be removed)
   - Program output: 3 (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Initial XOR is non-zero (9 XOR 9 XOR 9 = 9).
   - Eve can remove pairs of 9s to keep the XOR zero.
   - Expected output: 12 (9 pairs can be removed)
   - Program output: 12 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to handle all the test cases correctly. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of each number and the conditions for the XOR to be zero.

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for all given test cases and edge cases.
