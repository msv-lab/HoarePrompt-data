To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the value of `cnt` based on the initial state provided.

The initial state says:
- `cnt` is increased by the sum of `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[1] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[2] / 2)`, and `math.floor(a[3] / 2)`.
- `a` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `math.floor(a[0] / 2)` computes the floor division of the first element of `a` by 2.
2. `math.floor(a[1] / 2)` computes the floor division of the second element of `a` by 2.
3. `math.floor(a[2] / 2)` computes the floor division of the third element of `a` by 2.
4. `math.floor(a[3] / 2)` computes the floor division of the fourth element of `a` by 2.

The sum of these four values is then added to `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the value of `cnt` in terms of the elements of `a`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is increased by the sum of `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[1] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[2] / 2)`, and `math.floor(a[3] / 2)`)**
