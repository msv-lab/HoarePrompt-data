Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if the count of numbers with each bit set to 1 in their binary representation is even. For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

The XOR of the sequence is zero if:
- The count of 1s and 3s (both have the least significant bit set) is even.
- The count of 2s (has the second least significant bit set) is even.
- The count of 4s (has the most significant bit set) is even.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial XOR Calculation**: If the initial counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the XOR is non-zero. Eve can remove one of these to make the XOR zero, giving Bob a win.
2. **Pairwise Removal**: Each pair of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) can be removed without changing the parity of the counts of the remaining numbers. This means Eve can remove pairs to maximize Bob's wins.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 because Eve can remove one of these to make the XOR zero.
2. **Pairwise Removal**: The program adds half of each count (rounded down) to the count because each pair can be removed without changing the parity of the counts.

### Correctness

The program correctly implements the logic described above. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the initial XOR is non-zero. Eve can remove one of these to make the XOR zero, so Bob wins once.
- For each count, the number of pairs that can be removed is `floor(count / 2)`. Each pair removal does not change the parity of the remaining counts, so Bob can win that many times.

The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements, and the provided examples match the expected output.

### Conclusion

The given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
