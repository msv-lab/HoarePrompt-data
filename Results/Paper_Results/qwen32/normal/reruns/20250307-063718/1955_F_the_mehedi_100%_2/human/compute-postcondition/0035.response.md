The code snippet `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` increments the variable `cnt` by the floor division of `x` by 2. Given that `x` is the next element in the list `a` and `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the value of `x` is an integer. The floor division operation `math.floor(x / 2)` will yield an integer result.

The impact of the code is solely on the variable `cnt`, which is increased by the calculated value. The list `a` and the variable `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
