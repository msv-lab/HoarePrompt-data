The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, storing the result in the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `a` will be a list containing four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

Output State: **`t` (the number of test cases) is greater than 0, `a` is a list of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.**
