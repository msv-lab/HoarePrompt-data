To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variable `cnt`. The code snippet increments `cnt` by the value of `math.floor(x / 2)`.

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is 1 if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

The code snippet:
```
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

This means `cnt` will be updated to its current value plus the floor of `x / 2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `cnt` is updated to its initial value plus `math.floor(x / 2)`**.

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is updated to its initial value plus the floor of `x` divided by 2.
