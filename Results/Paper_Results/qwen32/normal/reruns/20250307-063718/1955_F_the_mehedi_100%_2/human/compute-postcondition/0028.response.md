The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The initial state of `cnt` is not directly affected by this code, as `a` is reassigned, but the new `a` will be used to recalculate `cnt` if needed in subsequent code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The initial state of `cnt` is not recalculated in this snippet.**
In natural language: The variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input. The value of `cnt` remains as it was initially defined, and it will need to be recalculated if the initial state conditions change based on the new `a`.
