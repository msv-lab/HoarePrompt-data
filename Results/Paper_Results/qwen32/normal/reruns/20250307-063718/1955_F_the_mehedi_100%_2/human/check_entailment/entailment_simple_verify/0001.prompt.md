You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1

            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)

        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: `cnt` is `n * (1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a))` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is `n * sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`. The list `a` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the XOR operation. XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. The problem is to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, which means the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero after Eve removes some numbers optimally.

Given the constraints that each number in the sequence doesn't exceed 4, the XOR of the sequence can be influenced by the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

- The number 1 contributes to the least significant bit (LSB).
- The number 2 contributes to the second least significant bit (2nd LSB).
- The number 3 contributes to both the LSB and the 2nd LSB.
- The number 4 contributes to the third least significant bit (3rd LSB).

Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This means:
- The count of numbers contributing to the LSB (1s and 3s) must be even.
- The count of numbers contributing to the 2nd LSB (2s and 3s) must be even.
- The count of numbers contributing to the 3rd LSB (4s) must be even.

### Strategy for Eve

Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins. To do this, she should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as many times as possible. This involves removing numbers in such a way that the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are balanced to achieve even counts for each bit position.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Check for LSB and 2nd LSB:**
   ```python
   if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
       cnt += 1
   ```
   This condition checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob can win once initially because the XOR of the entire sequence is zero (since the counts of 1s and 3s are both odd, they cancel out in the LSB, and similarly for 2s and 3s in the 2nd LSB).

2. **Counting Pairs:**
   ```python
   for x in a:
       cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
   ```
   This loop adds half the count of each type of number to `cnt`. This is based on the idea that each pair of numbers can be removed to maintain even counts for each bit position.

### Correctness

The program seems to follow the logic of balancing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s to maximize Bob's wins. However, there are some nuances to consider:
- The initial check for odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is correct.
- The loop that adds half the count of each type of number is also correct because each pair can be removed to maintain even counts.

However, the program does not account for the 4s explicitly in the initial check, which might be a potential oversight. But given the problem constraints and the nature of XOR, the provided solution seems to cover the essential cases.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Initially, the XOR is zero because the counts of 1s and 3s are both odd. After removing one number, the XOR becomes non-zero.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Initially, the XOR is non-zero. By removing one 1 and one 3, the XOR becomes zero.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Initially, the XOR is zero. By removing pairs, Bob can win three times.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Initially, the XOR is non-zero. By removing pairs, Bob can win three times.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Initially, the XOR is zero. By removing pairs, Bob can win twelve times.

The program seems to produce the correct output for the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
