To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to consider the initial value of `cnt` and the value of `math.floor(x / 2)`. 

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is 1 if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.

```
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

The value of `cnt` will be updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value. The value of `x` is not specified, so we can only express the new value of `cnt` in terms of `x`.

If `cnt` was initially 1 (meaning the first three elements of `a` are all odd), the new value of `cnt` will be `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`. If `cnt` was initially 0 (meaning the first three elements of `a` are not all odd), the new value of `cnt` will be `0 + math.floor(x / 2)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is `1 + math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
