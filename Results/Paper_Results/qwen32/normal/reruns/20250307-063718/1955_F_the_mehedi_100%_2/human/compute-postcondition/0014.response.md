The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. The loop's execution depends on the value provided by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. Since the loop head does not contain any variables that we can adjust directly, the only state we need to consider is the number of iterations left.

Given that the loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, and assuming that the loop has just finished an iteration, we need to decrease the number of remaining iterations by 1. However, since we do not have the exact number of iterations left, we can only describe the state in terms of the loop control variable.

State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[1] / 2)`, `math.floor(a[2] / 2)`, and `math.floor(a[3] / 2)`, and `a` remains unchanged. The loop will execute one more time if there are iterations left.**
