The code snippet `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of the input string `s`. The length of `s` and the characters in `s` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, and either the length of `s` is 1 or `s` contains more than one distinct character; `s2` is a string that is a random permutation of the characters in `s`.**
