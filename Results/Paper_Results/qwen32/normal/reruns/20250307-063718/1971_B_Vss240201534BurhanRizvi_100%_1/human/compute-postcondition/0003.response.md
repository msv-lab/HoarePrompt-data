The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t` or `s`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is a string of length 1 consisting of a lowercase English letter.

2. **Analyze the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('No')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'No'` to the console.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `s`, the values of these variables do not affect the output.
   - The output is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
