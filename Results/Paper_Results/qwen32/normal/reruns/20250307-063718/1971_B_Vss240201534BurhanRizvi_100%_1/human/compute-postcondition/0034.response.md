The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these affect the `print` statement itself. The `print('Yes')` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `s`, `s2`, and the operations performed on `s2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. `s` is a new input string provided by the user.
3. `_` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the print statement.
4. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is updated to `s[1:] + s[0]` (a rotation of the string `s` by one position to the left).
5. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s2` is set to a random permutation of the characters in `s`.

Regardless of the conditions and operations on `s2`, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute and print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
