The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t` or `s`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
2. The variable `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'No'` directly.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `s`, the output is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
