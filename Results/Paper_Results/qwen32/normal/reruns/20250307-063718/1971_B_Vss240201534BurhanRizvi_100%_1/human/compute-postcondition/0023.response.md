Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string if `s` is not equal to `s2`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, `s2` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`.
- The value of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'Yes'`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Output: **Yes**
