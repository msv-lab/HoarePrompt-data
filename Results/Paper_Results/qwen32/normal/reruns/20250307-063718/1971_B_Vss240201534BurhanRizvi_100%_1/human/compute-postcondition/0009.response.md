Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, and `s` contains more than one distinct character; `s2` is a string that is a random permutation of the characters in `s`. The current value of `s` is equal to the current value of `s2`.**
