Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print(s2)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable `t` does not affect the `s2` variable directly, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement).
2. `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
3. The length of `s` is not equal to 1.
4. `s` contains more than one distinct character.
5. The string `s2` is defined as follows:
   - If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `s2` is the string `s` with the first character moved to the end.

### Code Analysis:
The `s2` variable is determined based on the following logic:
- If `s` is already equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. However, since the problem states that `s` contains more than one distinct character, it implies that `s` is not equal to `s2` initially because moving the first character to the end will change the string.
- Therefore, `s2` will be `s` with its first character moved to the end.

### Example:
Let's take an example string `s` to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = "abc"`.
- According to the logic, `s2` will be `"bc" + "a"`, which results in `"bca"`.

### General Case:
For any string `s` with more than one distinct character and length greater than 1, `s2` will be the string with the first character moved to the end.

### Conclusion:
The `print(s2)` statement will print the string `s` with its first character moved to the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **s2 (where s2 is the string s with the first character moved to the end)**
