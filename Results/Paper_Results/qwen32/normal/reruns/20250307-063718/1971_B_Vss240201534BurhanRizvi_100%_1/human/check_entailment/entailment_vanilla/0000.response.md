Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by a rearrangement of the string `s` that is not equal to `s`, if such a rearrangement is possible.
   - If no such rearrangement is possible, output "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
   - The length of string `s` is at most 10.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program iterates over each test case, and for each string `s`:
1. **Single Character Check**:
   - If the length of `s` is 1, it outputs "NO" because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
   - This is correct.

2. **Uniform Characters Check**:
   - If the string consists of uniform characters (i.e., all characters are the same), it outputs "NO" because any rearrangement of such a string will be the same as the original string.
   - This is also correct.

3. **Random Rearrangement**:
   - If the string can be rearranged, it uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string.
   - If the random permutation is the same as the original string, it performs a simple swap of the first and second characters to ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original.
   - This logic is correct in ensuring that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid rearrangement is found, it outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
   - If no valid rearrangement is possible, it outputs "NO".

### Correctness:
The program handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement:
- Single character strings.
- Strings with all identical characters.
- Strings that can be rearranged to form a different string.

The use of `random.sample` ensures that a random permutation is generated, and the fallback mechanism (swapping the first two characters) ensures that the output is always a valid rearrangement if possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
