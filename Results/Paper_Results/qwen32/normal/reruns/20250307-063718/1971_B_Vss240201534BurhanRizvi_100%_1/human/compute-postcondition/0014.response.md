Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of `s` is not equal to 1. If all characters in `s` are the same and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then no change is made to `s`. Otherwise, `s` contains more than one distinct character, and if `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` with the first character moved to the end.**
