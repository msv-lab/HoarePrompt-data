The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `s`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
2. The variable `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with the additional condition that the length of `s` is greater than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'No'`, which does not depend on the values of `t` or `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
