The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t` and `s`, and the derived variable `s2`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `s`**: It is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with the length not equal to 1 and containing more than one distinct character. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `s2`**: It is derived based on the value of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is the string `s` with the first character moved to the end. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only contains the string `'Yes'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **Yes**
