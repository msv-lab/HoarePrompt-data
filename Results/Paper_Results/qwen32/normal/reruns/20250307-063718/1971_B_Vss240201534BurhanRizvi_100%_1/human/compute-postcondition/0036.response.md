Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is updated to `s[1:] + s[0]`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s2` is updated to a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.**
