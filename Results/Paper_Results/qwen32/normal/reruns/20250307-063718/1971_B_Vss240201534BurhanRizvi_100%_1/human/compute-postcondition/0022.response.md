Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string if `s` is not equal to `s2`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, `s2` remains unchanged.**
