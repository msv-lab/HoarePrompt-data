The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s`, removes the first character, and appends it to the end of the remaining string. Since `s` and `s2` were initially equal, the new value of `s2` will be the result of this operation. The other variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, and `s` contains more than one distinct character; `s2` is the string `s` with the first character moved to the end.**
