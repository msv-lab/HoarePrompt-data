The code snippet takes the string `s` and rearranges it such that the first character is moved to the end of the string, and all other characters are shifted one position to the left. This new arrangement is stored in `s2`.

Given the initial state, `s2` was previously a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order. After executing the code, `s2` is now specifically defined as `s[1:] + s[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, `_` is incremented by 1, `s2` is the string `s[1:] + s[0]`.**
