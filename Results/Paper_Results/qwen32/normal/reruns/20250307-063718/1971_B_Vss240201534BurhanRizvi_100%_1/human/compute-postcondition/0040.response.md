Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string cannot be rearranged (i.e., it is either a single character or all characters are the same), it outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' and provides a rearranged version of the string. The function does not modify the original string `s` but uses it to generate and print the output for each test case.**
