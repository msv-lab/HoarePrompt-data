Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the length of `s` is 1, no change is made to `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, then either all characters in `s` are the same (no change to `s`), or `s` contains more than one distinct character and `s` is transformed by moving its first character to the end.**
