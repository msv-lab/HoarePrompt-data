The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `t`, `s`, or `_` as they are not used within the statement itself. The statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `s` is a string provided by the user. It is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('No')`, it will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
