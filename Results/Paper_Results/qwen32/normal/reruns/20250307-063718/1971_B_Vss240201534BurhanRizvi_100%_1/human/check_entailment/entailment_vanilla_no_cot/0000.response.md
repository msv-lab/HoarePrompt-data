Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to generate a rearrangement of the string `s` that is not equal to `s` itself. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The output for "NO" is case-insensitive, but the program uses 'No' instead of 'NO', which does not match the problem's output requirements.
2. The method used to generate a rearrangement of the string is not guaranteed to produce a different string. Using `random.sample` might sometimes return the same permutation, especially for smaller strings.
3. The fallback mechanism `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` is not guaranteed to produce a different string for all inputs. For example, if the string is already in a cyclic order (like "abc" -> "bca" -> "cab" -> "abc"), this method will not work.

To ensure correctness, we should use a different approach to generate a rearrangement that is guaranteed to be different from the original string, and we should adhere to the correct case for "YES" and "NO". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1 or len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s2 = list(s)
            s2[0], s2[1] = s2[1], s2[0]  # Swap the first two characters
            print('YES')
            print(''.join(s2))

func()
```

This version swaps the first two characters of the string, which is guaranteed to produce a different string if the string has more than one unique character. It also handles the edge cases correctly and adheres to the case requirements for "YES" and "NO".
