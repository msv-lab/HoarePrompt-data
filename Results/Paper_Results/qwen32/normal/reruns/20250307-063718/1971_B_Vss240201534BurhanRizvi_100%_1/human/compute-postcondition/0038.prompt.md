Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the length of `s` is 1, no change is made to `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, then either all characters in `s` are the same (no change to `s`), or `s` contains more than one distinct character and `s` is transformed by moving its first character to the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` has a length of 1, no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, no changes are made to `s`. If `s` is not a rotation of itself and does not consist of the same character repeated more than once, `s` is transformed into `s2` by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string. If `s` is a rotation of itself, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `s` has a length of 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is updated to `s[1:] + s[0]`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s2` is updated to a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
