The code snippet generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of the input string `s`. The length of `s2` will be the same as `s`, and `s2` will contain the same characters as `s`, just in a potentially different order. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `s2` is a string that is a random permutation of the characters in `s`.**
