In the given task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `s`, but the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on these variables.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly outputs the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t` and `s`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
