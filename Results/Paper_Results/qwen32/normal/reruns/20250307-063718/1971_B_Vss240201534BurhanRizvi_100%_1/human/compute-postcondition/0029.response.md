The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `s`, and `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is a new input string provided by the user.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('No')` statement is executed, which outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `_`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **No**
