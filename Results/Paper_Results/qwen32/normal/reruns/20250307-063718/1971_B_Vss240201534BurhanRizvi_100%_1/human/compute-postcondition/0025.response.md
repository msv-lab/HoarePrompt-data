Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string if `s` is not already a rotation of itself. If `s` is a rotation of itself, `s2` remains unchanged.**
