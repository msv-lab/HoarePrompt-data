Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` has a length of 1, no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, no changes are made to `s`. If `s` is not a rotation of itself and does not consist of the same character repeated more than once, `s` is transformed into `s2` by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string. If `s` is a rotation of itself, `s` remains unchanged.**
