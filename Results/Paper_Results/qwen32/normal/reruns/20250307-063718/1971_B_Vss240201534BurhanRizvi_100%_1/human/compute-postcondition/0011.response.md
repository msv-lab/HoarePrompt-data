Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, and `s` contains more than one distinct character. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is the string `s` with the first character moved to the end.**
