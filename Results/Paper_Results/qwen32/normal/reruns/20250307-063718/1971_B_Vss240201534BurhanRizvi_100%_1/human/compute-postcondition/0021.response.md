The code takes the string `s` and rearranges it such that the first character is moved to the end of the string. The new string is assigned to `s2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.**
