You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string cannot be rearranged (i.e., it is either a single character or all characters are the same), it outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' and provides a rearranged version of the string. The function does not modify the original string `s` but uses it to generate and print the output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by a rearrangement of the string `s` that is not equal to `s`, if such a rearrangement is possible.
   - If no such rearrangement is possible, output "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
   - The length of string `s` is at most 10.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program iterates over each test case, and for each string `s`:
1. **Single Character Check**:
   - If the length of `s` is 1, it outputs "NO" because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
   - This is correct.

2. **Uniform Characters Check**:
   - If the string consists of uniform characters (i.e., all characters are the same), it outputs "NO" because any rearrangement of such a string will be the same as the original string.
   - This is also correct.

3. **Random Rearrangement**:
   - If the string can be rearranged, it uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string.
   - If the random permutation is the same as the original string, it performs a simple swap of the first and second characters to ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original.
   - This logic is correct in ensuring that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid rearrangement is found, it outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
   - If no valid rearrangement is possible, it outputs "NO".

### Correctness:
The program handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement:
- Single character strings.
- Strings with all identical characters.
- Strings that can be rearranged to form a different string.

The use of `random.sample` ensures that a random permutation is generated, and the fallback mechanism (swapping the first two characters) ensures that the output is always a valid rearrangement if possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
