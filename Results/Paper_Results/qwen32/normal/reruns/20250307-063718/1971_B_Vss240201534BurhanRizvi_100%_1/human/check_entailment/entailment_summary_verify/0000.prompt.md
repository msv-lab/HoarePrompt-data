You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string cannot be rearranged (i.e., it is either a single character or all characters are the same), it outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' and provides a rearranged version of the string. The function does not modify the original string `s` but uses it to generate and print the output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: 
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.
   - Each test case contains a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, if no such string `r` exists (a rearrangement of `s` that is not equal to `s`), output "NO" (without quotes).
   - Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string `r`, consisting of letters of string `s`.
   - If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. **Single Character Case**: If the string `s` has a length of 1, it outputs "NO" because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
2. **Uniform Character Case**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), it outputs "NO" because all rearrangements of such a string will be the same.
3. **General Case**:
   - It attempts to randomly shuffle the string `s` using `random.sample`.
   - If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it performs a simple swap of the first and second characters.
   - It then outputs "YES" and the modified string `s2`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Single Character Case**: The program correctly outputs "NO" for a single character string.
2. **Uniform Character Case**: The program correctly outputs "NO" for a string with uniform characters.
3. **General Case**:
   - The program attempts to shuffle the string and checks if the shuffled string is the same as the original. If it is, it performs a simple swap.
   - The simple swap (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`) will ensure that the string is different from the original if the string has more than one character and is not uniform.
   - However, the use of `random.sample` does not guarantee that the shuffled string will always be different from the original string. While the probability is low for small strings, it is still possible for the shuffled string to be the same as the original string.

### Potential Issue:
- The use of `random.sample` does not guarantee a different string every time, and there is a non-zero probability that the shuffled string will be the same as the original string.
- If the shuffled string is the same as the original string and the length of the string is more than 1 and not uniform, the program correctly performs a swap, but the reliance on `random.sample` introduces a potential issue.

### Conclusion:
While the program handles most cases correctly, the reliance on `random.sample` introduces a potential issue where the shuffled string might be the same as the original string, which would make the program incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it relies on `random.sample`, which does not guarantee a different string every time, even though the probability is low for small strings. If the shuffled string is the same as the original string, the program performs a swap, but this introduces a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior in some cases.
