The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Based on the initial state provided, `pf[i]` holds the value `int(data[3])`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[3])` maps to a list containing `i`.**

In simpler terms, the dictionary `mp` now includes an entry where the key is the integer value of `data[3]`, and the value is a list containing `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
