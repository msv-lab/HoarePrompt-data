You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of its elements is zero. It outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after processing all queries of a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it seems to handle all the cases correctly:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array up to each index. The prefix XOR (`pf[i]`) is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - This allows for quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r` using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - A dictionary (`mp`) is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding the positions where a specific prefix XOR value appears in the array.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray itself is interesting (can be divided into one part).
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are positions within the subarray where the prefix XOR values match in a way that would allow the subarray to be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is `0` directly.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray cannot be divided into parts with equal XOR values by checking the positions of prefix XOR values within the subarray.
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant positions in the list of prefix XOR indices.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for each query and prints them at the end.

The program seems to cover all the necessary cases and efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem description. No obvious edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is considered correct based on the given problem description and examples.
