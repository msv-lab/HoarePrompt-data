The code snippet `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` will find the insertion point in the sorted list `v1` where the value `l` would go to maintain the order. Given the possible values of `v1`, we can determine `it1` based on the value of `l`.

- If `v1` is `[0, 1]` (which happens if `pf[r]` is `0`), `it1` will be `0` if `l` is `0`, `1` if `l` is `1`, and `2` if `l` is greater than `1`.
- If `v1` is `[2]` (which happens if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`), `it1` will be `0` if `l` is less than `2`, and `1` if `l` is `2` or greater.
- If `v1` is `[]`, `it1` will always be `0` since there are no elements in the list.

Given the initial state and the possible values of `v1` and `l`, the value of `it1` can be determined accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements if `x` equals 0, `l` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `r` is `int(data[15 + 2*q])`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements; otherwise, `results` has `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])` which is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` as determined by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`**.
