### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray can be divided into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of elements in each part is equal. The program uses prefix XOR values and binary search to efficiently answer the queries.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array `a`. The prefix XOR up to index `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - This helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray `[l, r]` using the formula: `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program maintains a dictionary `mp` where keys are the prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.
   - This allows for efficient lookup of indices where a specific prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` is zero, it immediately returns 'YES' because the subarray can be divided into any number of parts with XOR zero.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there exists a way to divide the subarray into parts with equal XOR. This is done by checking if there are indices in the prefix XOR list that allow for such a division.
   - Specifically, for a subarray `[l, r]`, the program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[i-1] == pf[l-1]` (or similar conditions to ensure the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR).

4. **Binary Search:**
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the appropriate indices in the prefix XOR lists.
   - This ensures that the query processing is efficient even for large arrays and a large number of queries.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values. It efficiently handles the prefix XOR calculations and query processing using binary search, ensuring that it can handle the input size constraints.

Therefore, based on the provided logic and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
