The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` already exists as a key in the dictionary `mp` with an initial value of an empty list `[]` if `pf[i]` was not previously in `mp`, or it already contains some list of indices.

After executing the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp` will now include the value of `i`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `4 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string.**
