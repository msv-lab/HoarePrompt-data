Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[3])`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include `pf[i]` as a key with an empty list as its value.**
