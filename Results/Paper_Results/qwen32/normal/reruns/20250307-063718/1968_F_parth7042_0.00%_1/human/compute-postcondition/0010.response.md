The code snippet initializes a list `pf` with `n + 1` zeros. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
