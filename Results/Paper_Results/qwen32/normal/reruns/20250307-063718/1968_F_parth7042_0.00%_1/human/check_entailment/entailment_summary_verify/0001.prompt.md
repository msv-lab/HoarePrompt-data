You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of its elements is zero. It outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after processing all queries of a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- The program should answer multiple queries for different subarrays of a given array.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the array size `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n+1` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n+1`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to map prefix XOR values to their indices.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - It calculates the prefix XOR for each element in the array.
   - It stores these prefix XOR values in the `pf` array and updates the `mp` dictionary to keep track of the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`, so it appends "YES" to the results.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exist indices in the `mp` dictionary that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.
     - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices.
     - If such indices exist, it appends "YES" to the results; otherwise, it appends "NO".

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends a newline to the results.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Usage**: The use of prefix XOR is correct for determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently.
- **Dictionary for Indices**: The dictionary `mp` is used correctly to store and retrieve indices of prefix XOR values, which is necessary for checking if a valid split exists.
- **Binary Search**: The use of `bisect_left` for finding indices is appropriate for efficiently checking the conditions for a valid split.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. It handles the input efficiently and outputs the correct results for each query.

Correctness: **True**
