The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` to the list stored in `mp[pf[i]]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state.

- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements.
- `t` is `t - 1`.
- `idx` is `9 + 2*n + 2*q`, and since `n` is 2, `idx` becomes `9 + 4 + 2*q` which simplifies to `13 + 2*q`.
- `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`.
- `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged.
- `pf` is `[0, 0]`.
- `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.
- `i` is 1.
- If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mp`.

Given `i` is 1, `pf[i]` is `pf[1]` which is `0`. Therefore, `mp[0]` will have `1` appended to it.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `13 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 1, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1]}`.**
