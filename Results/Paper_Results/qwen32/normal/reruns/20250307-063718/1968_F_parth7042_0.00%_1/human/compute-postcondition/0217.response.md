Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `16 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[14 + 2*q + 3])`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements; otherwise, `results` has `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` includes one more element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes one more element 'NO'. `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])` which is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, and `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` as determined by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `idx` has been incremented by 2, changing its value to `16 + 2*q + 2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
