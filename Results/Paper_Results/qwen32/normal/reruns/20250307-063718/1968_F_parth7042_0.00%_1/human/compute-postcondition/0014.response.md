The code snippet provided increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given the initial state, `idx` was 3, and after the increment, `idx` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[3])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.**
