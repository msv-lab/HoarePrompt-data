Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `data`: A list of strings representing the input values.
- `t`: An integer initialized to 0. It likely represents the current test case index.
- `idx`: The final index after processing all test cases.
- `n` and `q`: The values from the last test case processed.
- `a`: A list of integers from the last test case.
- `pf`: A prefix XOR list from the last test case.
- `mp`: A dictionary of prefix XOR values and their indices from the last test case.
- `results`: A list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and it includes an additional empty string after the results of the last test case.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement joins all elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`). The `results` list contains strings 'YES' or 'NO' representing the outcome of each test case, and there is an additional empty string at the end.

### Output:
Since the exact contents of `results` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output format based on the given information.

The print statement will produce a string where each element of `results` is separated by a newline character. The final element of `results` is an empty string, which will result in an additional newline at the end of the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES\nNO\n...\n' (where each 'YES' or 'NO' corresponds to the result of each test case, and there is an additional newline at the end)**

This description accounts for the dynamic nature of the `results` list, which can vary based on the input test cases.
