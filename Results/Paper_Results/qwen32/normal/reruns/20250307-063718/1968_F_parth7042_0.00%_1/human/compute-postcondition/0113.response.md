The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` is initially an empty list. After appending `i`, `mp[pf[i]]` will contain the value `[i]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `6 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` is at least `k + 2`; `q` is `int(data[idx - 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[idx - 2]) ^ int(data[idx - 1])`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string; `i` is `k + 2`; `mp[pf[i]]` is `[i]`.**
