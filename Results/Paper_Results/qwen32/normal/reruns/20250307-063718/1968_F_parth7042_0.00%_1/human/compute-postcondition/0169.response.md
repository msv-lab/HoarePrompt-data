The code snippet `a = [0] * (n + 1)` reassigns the list `a` to a new list of `n + 1` zeros, effectively discarding its previous values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is 7 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is `int(data[5 + 2*n])`; `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.**

In simple terms, the list `a` has been reset to contain `n + 1` zeros, while all other variables retain their previous values.
