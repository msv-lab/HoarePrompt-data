The code snippet `results.append('')` appends an empty string to the `results` list. None of the other variables are affected. Therefore, the `results` list now includes one more element, which is an empty string, in addition to the `n + 2*q` elements it already had.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.**
