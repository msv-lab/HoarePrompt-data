Output State: **data is a list of strings representing the input values; t is 0; idx is the final index after processing all test cases; n and q are the values from the last test case processed; a is the list of integers from the last test case; pf is the prefix XOR list from the last test case; mp is the dictionary of prefix XOR values and their indices from the last test case; results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and it includes an additional empty string after the results of the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `data` remains the same list of input values.
- `t` becomes 0 since all test cases have been processed.
- `idx` is the position in `data` after all test cases and their corresponding queries have been processed.
- `n` and `q` hold the values from the last test case.
- `a` is the list of integers from the last test case.
- `pf` is the prefix XOR list constructed from the last test case.
- `mp` is the dictionary mapping prefix XOR values to their respective indices from the last test case.
- `results` contains all the 'YES' or 'NO' answers for all queries across all test cases, with an additional empty string at the end to signify the completion of the last test case.
