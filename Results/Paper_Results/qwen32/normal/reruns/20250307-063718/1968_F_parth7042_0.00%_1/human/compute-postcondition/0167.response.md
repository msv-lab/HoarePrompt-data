Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is `int(data[5 + 2*n])`; `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.**

In natural language: The variable `q` has been updated to the integer value of the string at the position `idx + 1` in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values.
