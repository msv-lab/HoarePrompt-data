Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `r` is `int(data[15 + 2*q])`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements; otherwise, `results` has `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` includes one more element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes one more element 'NO'. `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])` which is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, and `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` as determined by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `16 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[14 + 2*q + 3])`, and `x` is `0` or `2`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 3` additional elements. If `x` equals 2, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, `results` includes one more element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes one more element 'NO'. `v1` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `18 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index just before where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` has an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` has an additional 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
