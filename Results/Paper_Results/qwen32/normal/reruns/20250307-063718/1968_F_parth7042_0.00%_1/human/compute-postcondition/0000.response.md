The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This list is then assigned to the variable `data`. 

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. For each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `data` will hold a list of strings representing the input values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged in terms of their described constraints and values unless further assignment occurs.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.**
