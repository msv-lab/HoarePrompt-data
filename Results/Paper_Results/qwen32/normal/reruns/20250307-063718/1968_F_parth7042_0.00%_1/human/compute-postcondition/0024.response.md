The code snippet `mp[pf[i]] = []` modifies the dictionary `mp` by setting the value of the key `pf[i]` to an empty list. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, and `pf[5]` is `int(data[4])`. Therefore, the key `int(data[4])` in the dictionary `mp` will be updated to an empty list.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[3])` maps to a list containing `i` and the key `int(data[4])` maps to an empty list; `i` is 5**.
