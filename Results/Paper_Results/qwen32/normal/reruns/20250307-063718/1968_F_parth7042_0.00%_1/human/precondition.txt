The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, representing the subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r to be queried. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
