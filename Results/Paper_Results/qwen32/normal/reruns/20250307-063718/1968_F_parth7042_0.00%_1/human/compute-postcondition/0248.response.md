Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) for each query.**
