The code snippet `r = int(data[idx + 1])` takes the value at the index `idx + 1` of the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `r`. Given that `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `r` will be assigned the integer value of `data[15 + 2*q]`.

Here's the updated output state considering the provided initial state and the code execution:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `l` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `r` is `int(data[15 + 2*q])`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `r` has been assigned the integer value of the element at index `15 + 2*q` in the `data` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
