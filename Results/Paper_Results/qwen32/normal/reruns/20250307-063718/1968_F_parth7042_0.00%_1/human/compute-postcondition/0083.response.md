Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `3 + n + 2*q`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is `0`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the `idx` variable will have been incremented by `2*q` (since `idx` is incremented by 2 in each iteration), `q` will be `0` (since the loop runs `q` times and `q` is decremented by 1 in each iteration), and `results` will contain a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings corresponding to each query processed by the loop. All other variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) remain unchanged from their initial state except for the modifications inherently required by the loop's logic.
