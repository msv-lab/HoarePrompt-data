The code snippet `a[i] = int(data[idx])` updates the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` to the integer value of the string at index `idx` in the list `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
- `idx` is 5.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`.
- `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`.
- `i` is 6.

The code updates `a[6]` to `int(data[5])`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`; `i` is 6.**
