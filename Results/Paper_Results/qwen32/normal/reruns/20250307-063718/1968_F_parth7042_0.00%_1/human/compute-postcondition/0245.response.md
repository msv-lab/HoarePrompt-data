The code appends an empty string `''` to the `results` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **data is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, t is t - 1, idx is 14 + 2*q + 2*q, n is 2, q is 0, a is a list where a[1] is int(data[12 + 2*q]) and a[2] is int(data[14 + 2*q]), pf is [0, 0, a[2]], mp is {0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}, results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes n + 2*q + q additional elements plus one more element which is an empty string.**
