Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `18 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` has elements based on the initial conditions with an additional 'YES', `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index just before where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order.`**

In simpler terms, the only change is that the string 'YES' has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
