The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given:
- `i` is 2
- `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`
- `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: []}` if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, otherwise `mp` remains `{0: [0, 1]}`

Since `i` is 2, `pf[i]` is `pf[2]`, which is `a[2]`. 

If `a[2]` is not in `mp`, `mp` would be initialized with `a[2]` as a key and an empty list as its value. However, since `mp` already has the key `a[2]` with an empty list as its value, the value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to this list.

Therefore, `mp[a[2]]` changes from `[]` to `[2]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[idx])`, the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 2, and `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`.**
