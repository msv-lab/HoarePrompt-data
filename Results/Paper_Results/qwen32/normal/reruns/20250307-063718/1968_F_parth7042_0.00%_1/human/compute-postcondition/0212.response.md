Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes one additional element 'NO', `l` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `r` is `int(data[15 + 2*q])`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` had `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements; otherwise, `results` had `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements before appending 'NO'. `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])` which is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` as determined by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Additionally, either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`.**

In simple terms, the `results` list now includes an additional element `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as described.
