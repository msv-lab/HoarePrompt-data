The code snippet provided appends the string 'YES' to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this specific line of code. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `9 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is the index where `r` would fit in the sorted list `v2`, minus one, recalculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` contains 'YES', `q` is incremented by 1.**
