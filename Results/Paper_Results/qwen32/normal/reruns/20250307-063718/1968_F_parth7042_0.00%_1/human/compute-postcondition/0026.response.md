The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list that is the value of the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, and `pf[i]` is `int(data[4])`. Therefore, the list corresponding to the key `int(data[4])` in `mp` will have `5` appended to it.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`; `i` is 5.**
