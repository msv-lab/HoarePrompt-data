Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `18 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `results` has elements based on the initial conditions with an additional 'YES' appended.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
