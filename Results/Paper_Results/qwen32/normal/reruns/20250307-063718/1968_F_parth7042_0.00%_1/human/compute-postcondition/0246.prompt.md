Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx])` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < 2^30`; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `3 + n + 2*q`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is `0`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, t is t - 1, idx is 14 + 2*q + 2*q, n is 2, q is 0, a is a list where a[1] is int(data[12 + 2*q]) and a[2] is int(data[14 + 2*q]), pf is [0, 0, a[2]], mp is {0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}, results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes n + 2*q + q additional elements plus one more element which is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
