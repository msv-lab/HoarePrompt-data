### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if a subarray of a given array can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

The program uses prefix XOR to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray. It maintains a dictionary `mp` where the keys are prefix XOR values and the values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur. This allows the program to quickly determine if there exists a subarray with a specific XOR value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It initializes an array `a` to store the elements and a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Computing Prefix XOR:**
   - For each element in the array, it computes the prefix XOR and stores it in `pf`.
   - It updates the dictionary `mp` to include the current index for the computed prefix XOR value.

4. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR value is zero, it immediately appends 'YES' to the results list since the subarray itself can be considered as one part.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (via `bisect_left`) to find if there exists an index in the dictionary that can split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends an empty string to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all the results joined by newlines.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. It efficiently computes the prefix XOR and uses binary search to check for valid splits. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
