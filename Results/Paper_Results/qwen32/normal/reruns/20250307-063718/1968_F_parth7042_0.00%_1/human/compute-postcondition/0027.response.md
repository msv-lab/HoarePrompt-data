The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 6. There are no other variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`; `i` is 6**
