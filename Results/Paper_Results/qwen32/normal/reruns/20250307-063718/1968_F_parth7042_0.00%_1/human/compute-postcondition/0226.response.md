Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `16 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[14 + 2*q + 3])`, and `x` is `0` or `2`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 3` additional elements and includes one more element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements and includes one more element 'YES'. `v1` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise, `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. `results` includes one more element 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list, regardless of the value of `x`. If `x` was 0, `results` would have had `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements before this operation, and now it has `n + 2*q + 3` additional elements. If `x` was 2, `results` would have had `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements before this operation, and now it has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements. In both cases, the last element added to `results` is 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.
