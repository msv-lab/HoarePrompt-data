The code snippet initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` zeros. The values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `a` is newly created and added to the state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
