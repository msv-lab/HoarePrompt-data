The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` will now hold the integer value of the string located at the index `idx` in the `data` list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**
