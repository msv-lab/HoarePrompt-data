You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. For each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: data is a list of strings representing the input values; t is 0; idx is the final index after processing all test cases; n and q are the values from the last test case processed; a is the list of integers from the last test case; pf is the prefix XOR list from the last test case; mp is the dictionary of prefix XOR values and their indices from the last test case; results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and it includes an additional empty string after the results of the last test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES\nNO\n...\n' (where each 'YES' or 'NO' corresponds to the result of each test case, and there is an additional newline at the end)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
