The code snippet `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` updates the value of `it1` by finding the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1` using binary search. This does not affect any other variables directly.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 11 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is `q - 1` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 5` additional elements, with the last one being 'YES' if `x == 0`, otherwise 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` that is less than `r`; `q` is `q - 1`.**
