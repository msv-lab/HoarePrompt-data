Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `3 + n`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is the index where `r` would fit in the sorted list `v2`, minus one. If the condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l))` is true, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `7 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is the index where `r` would fit in the sorted list `v2`, minus one. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'. `q` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `9 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is the index where `r` would fit in the sorted list `v2`, minus one, recalculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'. In both cases, `q` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
