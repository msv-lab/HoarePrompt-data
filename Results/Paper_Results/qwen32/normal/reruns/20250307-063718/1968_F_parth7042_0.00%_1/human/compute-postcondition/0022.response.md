Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[3])` maps to a list containing `i`; `i` is 5**.

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
