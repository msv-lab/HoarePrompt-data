The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The initial value of `idx` is `14 + 2*q`. After the increment, `idx` becomes `14 + 2*q + 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `l` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `r` is `int(data[15 + 2*q])`.**
