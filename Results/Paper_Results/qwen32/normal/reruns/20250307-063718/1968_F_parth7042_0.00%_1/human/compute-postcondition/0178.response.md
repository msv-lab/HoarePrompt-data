Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `8 + 2*n + 2*q`, `n` is 1, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[i]` is `int(data[9 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, a[1]]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is updated to include the index `i`. `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.**
