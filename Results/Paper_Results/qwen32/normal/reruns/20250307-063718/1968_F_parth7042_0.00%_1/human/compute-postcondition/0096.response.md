Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `4 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, and now includes `{0: [0]}`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string. Additionally, `pf[i]` is not in `mp`.**
