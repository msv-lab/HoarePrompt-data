### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- The program must handle multiple test cases, each with an array and multiple queries specifying subarrays.

#### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input data at once and processes it test case by test case.
   - It correctly initializes arrays and dictionaries for prefix XOR values and their indices.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated correctly such that `pf[i]` represents the XOR of the subarray from the start to the `i-th` element.
   - The dictionary `mp` maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is calculated using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`, so the program correctly appends "YES".
   - If `x` is not `0`, the program checks if there exist indices in the `mp` dictionary that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices is appropriate for efficiently checking the conditions for a valid split.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the results for each query and a newline after processing all queries of a test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary correctly states that the function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of its elements is zero. It outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after processing all queries of a test case.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Usage**: The use of prefix XOR is correct for determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently.
- **Dictionary for Indices**: The dictionary `mp` is used correctly to store and retrieve indices of prefix XOR values, which is necessary for checking if a valid split exists.
- **Binary Search**: The use of `bisect_left` for finding indices is appropriate for efficiently checking the conditions for a valid split.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic used to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR when `x` is not `0`. The current logic only checks if there are indices in the `mp` dictionary that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR, but it does not ensure that the XOR of each part is equal to `x / k` for some integer `k > 1`.

The current logic only checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match the required conditions, but it does not ensure that the XOR of each part is equal. This is a more complex problem that requires additional checks to ensure that the XOR of each part is indeed equal.

Given the problem description, the current logic is insufficient because it only checks for the existence of indices but does not ensure that the XOR of each part is equal. Therefore, the program may incorrectly output "YES" for cases where the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it does not ensure that the XOR of each part is equal when `x` is not `0`. It only checks for the existence of indices, which is not sufficient.

**Final: False**
