Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`. If `pf[i]` (which is `int(data[4])`) is not in the dictionary `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include the key `int(data[4])` mapping to an empty list. `i` is 5.**
