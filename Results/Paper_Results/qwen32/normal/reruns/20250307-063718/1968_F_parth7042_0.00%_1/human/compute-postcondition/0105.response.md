Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `5 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 3])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[idx - 1])`; `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` was not in `mp`, otherwise `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string; `i` is `k + 1`.**
