The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the string at the `idx` position in the `data` list. This means the previous value of `n` is replaced by this new value. No other variables are affected in this snippet.

Given that `idx` is defined as `5 + 2*n + 2*q` and `q` is 0, `idx` simplifies to `5 + 2*n`. However, since `n` is being reassigned, we need to consider the new value of `n` as `int(data[idx])`.

Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `int(data[5 + 2*n])`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is `int(data[5 + 2*n])`; `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.**
