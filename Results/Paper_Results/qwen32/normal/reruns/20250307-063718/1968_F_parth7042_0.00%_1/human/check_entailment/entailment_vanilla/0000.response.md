Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- The program should answer multiple queries for different subarrays of a given array.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the array size `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n+1` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n+1`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to map prefix XOR values to their indices.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - It calculates the prefix XOR for each element in the array.
   - It stores these prefix XOR values in the `pf` array and updates the `mp` dictionary to keep track of the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`, so it appends "YES" to the results.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exist indices in the `mp` dictionary that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.
     - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices.
     - If such indices exist, it appends "YES" to the results; otherwise, it appends "NO".

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends a newline to the results.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Usage**: The use of prefix XOR is correct for determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently.
- **Dictionary for Indices**: The dictionary `mp` is used correctly to store and retrieve indices of prefix XOR values, which is necessary for checking if a valid split exists.
- **Binary Search**: The use of `bisect_left` for finding indices is appropriate for efficiently checking the conditions for a valid split.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. It handles the input efficiently and outputs the correct results for each query.

Correctness: **True**
