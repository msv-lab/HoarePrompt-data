The code snippet provided increments the variable `idx` by 2. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `idx` was `3 + n`. After the code executes, `idx` becomes `3 + n + 2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is `5 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`.**
