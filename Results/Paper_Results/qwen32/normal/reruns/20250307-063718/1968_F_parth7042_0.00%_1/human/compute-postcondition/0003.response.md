Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx])` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < 2^30`; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`; `idx` is 1.**

Natural language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
