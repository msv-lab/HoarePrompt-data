The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `q`. Given that `idx` is initially 1, `q` will be assigned the integer value of `data[2]`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
