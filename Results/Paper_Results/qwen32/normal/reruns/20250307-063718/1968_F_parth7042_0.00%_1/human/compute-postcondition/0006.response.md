The code snippet assigns the integer value of the string at index `idx` of the list `data` to the variable `n`. The values of `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged. The variable `idx` is still 1.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
