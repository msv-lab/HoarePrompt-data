Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is 7 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is `int(data[5 + 2*n])`; `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs, specifically `mp = {(0): [0]}`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `8 + 2*n + 2*q`, `n` is 1, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[i]` is `int(data[9 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, a[1]]`, `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `13 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 1, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1]}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[idx])`, the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 2, and `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
