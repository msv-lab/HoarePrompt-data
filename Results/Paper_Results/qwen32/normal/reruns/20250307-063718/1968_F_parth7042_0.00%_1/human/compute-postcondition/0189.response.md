Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `14 + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[idx])`, the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 2, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1]}`**

In the output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it `14 + 2*q`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
