The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of its elements is zero. It outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after processing all queries of a test case.
