The code snippet `mp[pf[i]] = []` modifies the dictionary `mp` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is an empty list.

Given the initial state, `pf[i]` is `int(data[3])`, and `mp` is `{0: [0]}`. After executing the code, `mp` will have an additional key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is `[]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `mp` is `{0: [0], int(data[3]): []}`.**
