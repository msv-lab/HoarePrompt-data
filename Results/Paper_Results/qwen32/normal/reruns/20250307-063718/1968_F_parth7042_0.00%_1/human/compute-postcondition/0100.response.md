To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

From the provided state:
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
- `idx` is `4 + n + 2*q + 2`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list.
- `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i = k`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same as it is a loop condition and does not change within the loop.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `4 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

To make it more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `4 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string; `i` is `k + 1`.**
