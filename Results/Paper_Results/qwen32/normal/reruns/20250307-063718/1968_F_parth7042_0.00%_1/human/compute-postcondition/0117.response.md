The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means the value of `r` is now the integer representation of the string located at the index `idx + 1` in the list `data`.

The other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n` additional empty strings; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
