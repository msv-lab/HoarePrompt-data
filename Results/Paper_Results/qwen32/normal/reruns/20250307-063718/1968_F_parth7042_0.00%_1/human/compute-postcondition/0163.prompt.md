Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings representing the input values; t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; idx is 5 + 2*n + 2*q; n is the integer value of data[3 + n]; q is int(data[idx + 1 - 2]); a is a list of n + 1 zeros except a[i] for i in range(1, n + 1) which are now int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i]); pf is a list of n + 1 zeros except pf[i] for i in range(1, n + 1) which is now the cumulative XOR of a[1] to a[i]; mp is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in pf and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes n additional empty strings.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 7 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 2` additional elements, with the last one being 'YES' if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, otherwise it is 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` that is less than `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 9 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is `q - 1` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 4` additional elements, with the last one being 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, otherwise 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs in `mp` or an empty list if it does not occur; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` that is less than `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 11 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is `q - 1` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 6` additional elements, with the last one being 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, otherwise 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` that is less than `r` or -1 if no such index exists; `q` is `q - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
