Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `9 + 2*n + 2*q`, `n` is 2, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `pf` is `[0, 0]`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop and now includes `n + 2*q + 1` additional elements, `i` is 1. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mp`.**
