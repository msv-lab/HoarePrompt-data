Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, so if it was initially 1, it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
