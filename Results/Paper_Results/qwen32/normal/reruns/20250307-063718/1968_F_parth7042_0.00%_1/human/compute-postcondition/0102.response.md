The code snippet provided increments the variable `idx` by 1. This change affects the value of `idx` but does not alter any other variables or their values directly. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, and `i`) retain their previous states.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `5 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 3])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[idx - 1])`; `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` includes the value `i` in its list, updated to reflect the new `pf[i]`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string; `i` is `k + 1`.**
