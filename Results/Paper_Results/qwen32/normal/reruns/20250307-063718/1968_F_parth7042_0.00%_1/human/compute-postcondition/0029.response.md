The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that the initial value of `idx` is 5, after the execution of the code, `idx` will be 6. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`; `i` is 6.**
