The code snippet `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts the value of `l` into the list `v1` in a sorted manner and returns the index where `l` would be placed to maintain the sorted order. This operation does not change the values of `v1`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, or `results`. The only new variable introduced is `it1`, which holds the result of the `bisect_left` operation.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `idx` is 7 + 2*n + 2*q; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which are now `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n + 1`) which is now the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes `n + 1` additional empty strings, with the last one being 'YES' if `x` equals 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order.**
