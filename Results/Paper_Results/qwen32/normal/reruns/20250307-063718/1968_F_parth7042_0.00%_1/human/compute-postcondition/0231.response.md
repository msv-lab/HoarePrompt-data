The provided code snippet updates the value of `r` by reading a new integer from the `data` list at the position `idx + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `r` was previously `int(data[14 + 2*q + 3])`. After executing the code, `r` is now `int(data[idx + 1])`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least 7 elements, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `16 + 2*q + 2`, `n` is 2, `q` is `q`, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is `int(data[12 + 2*q])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[14 + 2*q])`, `pf` is `[0, 0, a[2]]`, `mp` is `{0: [0, 1], a[2]: [2]}`, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, and `x` is `0` or `2`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has `n + 2*q + 3` additional elements. If `x` equals 2, `results` has `n + 2*q + 2` additional elements. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, `results` includes one more element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes one more element 'NO'. `v1` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[r]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[r]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `v2` is `[0, 1]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `0`, `[2]` if `pf[l - 1]` is `a[2]`, or `[]` otherwise. `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
