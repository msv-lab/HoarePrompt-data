The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `idx` is `3 + n + 2*q + 2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is `3 + n + 2*q + 2`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `q` is `int(data[idx + 1 - 2])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[2 + i])` for `1 <= i <= n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique cumulative XOR value found in `pf` and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and now includes an additional empty string.**
