Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[3])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[3])` maps to a list containing `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5`; `i` is 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `idx` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `pf[6]` which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` maps to a list containing the value `5` and the key `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])` maps to a list containing the value `6`; `i` is 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
