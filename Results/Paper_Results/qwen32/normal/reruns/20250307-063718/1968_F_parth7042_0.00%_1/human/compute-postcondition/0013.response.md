The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `a[i]`. Given that `idx` is 3, `a[i]` will be assigned the value of `int(data[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `a[i]`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we assume `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[3])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`**.
