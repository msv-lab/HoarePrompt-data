The function `moedasMinimas` takes no input arguments directly, but it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where a_i is the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) where b_i is the cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th position (exclusive) when swapping with the j-th person. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
