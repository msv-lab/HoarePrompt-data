Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic of reversing the lists and the way it calculates the minimum cost is flawed. The program should be designed to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue, considering the costs `a_i` and `b_k` for each swap operation.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Reversing Lists**: The program reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions from the end of the queue.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the cost by iterating through the reversed lists and keeping track of prefix sums. However, this approach does not correctly account for the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: While the program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, the logic within `func_1` is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve using a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. This would involve considering the costs `a_i` and `b_k` for each potential swap operation and maintaining the minimum cost incurred.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if m == n:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Min-heap to store the minimum cost to swap with each person
    heap = []
    heapq.heappush(heap, (a[0], 0))
    current_cost = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n - m + 1):
        current_cost += b[i - 1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, (a[i], i))
        if heap[0][1] < i - m + 1:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    
    result = current_cost + heap[0][0]
    print(result)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function to process input
func_2()
```

This corrected version uses a priority queue to efficiently track the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.
