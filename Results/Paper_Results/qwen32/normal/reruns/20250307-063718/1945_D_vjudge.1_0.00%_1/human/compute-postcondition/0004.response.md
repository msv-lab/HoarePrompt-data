To determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of executing `func_1()`. However, the code snippet provided does not give us the definition or behavior of `func_1()`, so we can only assume that `func_1()` has been executed and may have altered some variables or performed some operations.

Since the behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we can infer that the only variable we know for certain is `numero_testes`, which remains unchanged based on the given information. The output state will reflect that `numero_testes` retains its initial value, and any other changes made by `func_1()` are unknown and not specified.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed.**
