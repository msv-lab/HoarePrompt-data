The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `resultado`. This means `resultado` is now set to positive infinity. The variables `pref`, `lista_A`, and `soma_b` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, and `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B`; `resultado` is `float('inf')`.**
