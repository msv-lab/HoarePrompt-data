Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b`**

In natural language: The value of `pref` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `soma_b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
