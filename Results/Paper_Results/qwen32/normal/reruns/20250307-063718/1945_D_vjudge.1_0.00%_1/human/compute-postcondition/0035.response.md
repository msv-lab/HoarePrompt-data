Output State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[i+1]`, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Natural Language: The value of `soma_b` has been updated to include `lista_B[i]`. The other variables, `pref`, `resultado`, `n`, and `i`, remain as they were, except `i` is incremented by 1.
