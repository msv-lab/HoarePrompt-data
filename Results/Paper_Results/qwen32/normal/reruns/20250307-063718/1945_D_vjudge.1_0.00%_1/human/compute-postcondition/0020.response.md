Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is `pref + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`.**
