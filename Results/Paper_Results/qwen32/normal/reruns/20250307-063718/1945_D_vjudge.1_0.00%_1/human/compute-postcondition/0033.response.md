The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value such that `i` is less than `n` but not less than `n - k`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as this is the behavior of the `for` loop in Python.

Let's break it down step by step:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `x` such that `n - k <= x < n`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `x + 1`.
- The condition `n - k <= x + 1 < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Since we only need to adjust `i` and `n` (and `n` remains unchanged), the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
