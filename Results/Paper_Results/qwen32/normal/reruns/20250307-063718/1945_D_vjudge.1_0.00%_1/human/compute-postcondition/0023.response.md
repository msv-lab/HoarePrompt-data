The code snippet `pref += lista_A[i]` updates the value of `pref` by adding the element at index `i` from `lista_A` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than `k`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n
- `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input
- `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `pref` is `pref + soma_b`

After executing `pref += lista_A[i]`, the value of `pref` changes to `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`**.
