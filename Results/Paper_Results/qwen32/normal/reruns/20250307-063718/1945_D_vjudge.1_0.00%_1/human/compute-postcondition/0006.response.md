Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The execution of `func_1()` does not affect the value of `numero_testes` since the initial state does not specify any changes to `numero_testes` within the function. The precondition remains valid, and no other variables are mentioned as being affected by the function call.
