Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue. Kirill can bribe people to swap positions, paying `a_j` coins to swap with the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins for each person between `j` and `i` (where `i` is Kirill's current position).

### Solution Explanation

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

Let's break down `func_1()`:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read `n` (number of people in the queue) and `k` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - Read the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` representing `a_i` and `b_i` values, respectively.
   - Reverse both lists. This step is crucial because the algorithm processes the queue from the end to the beginning.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `soma_b` (sum of `b_k` values) and `pref` (prefix sum of costs).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Iterate over the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists.
   - If the `a_j` value is less than the `b_k` value, add the accumulated `soma_b` and `a_j` to `pref` and reset `soma_b`.
   - Otherwise, add the `b_k` value to `soma_b`.

4. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - Initialize `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterate over the last `k` elements of the reversed lists.
   - For each element, update `resultado` with the minimum of the current `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `a_i`.
   - Add the `b_k` value to `soma_b`.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the minimum cost stored in `resultado`.

### Correctness Analysis

The algorithm attempts to minimize the total cost by considering the costs of bribing people from the end of the queue to the beginning. However, there are a few issues:
- The algorithm assumes that the optimal strategy involves bribing people from the end of the queue first, which may not always be the case.
- The handling of `pref` and `soma_b` may not correctly account for the minimum cost in all scenarios.
- The logic for updating `resultado` does not consider all possible ways to minimize the cost.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided solution, it is evident that the algorithm does not guarantee finding the minimum cost in all scenarios. The approach of reversing the lists and processing from the end to the beginning does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
