To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `n - k` to `n`. The loop will execute if the range is valid, meaning `n - k` must be less than `n`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Range Validity**: For the loop to execute, `n - k` must be less than `n`. This is always true as long as `k` is a non-negative integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Initialization of `i`**: The variable `i` will be initialized to `n - k` at the start of the loop. Therefore, `i` does not need to be explicitly set in the state before the loop starts because it will be set by the range.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `pref`, `soma_b`, and `resultado` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the program state, and their initial values are given.

Given this, the only thing we need to ensure is that the range is valid, which means `n` should be greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B`, `resultado` is `float('inf')`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
