In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `numero_testes`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect whether the loop executes or not, the only variable we need to adjust is `numero_testes`.

The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that the problem statement already specifies that `numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is within this range.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state of `numero_testes` is necessary because it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4**
