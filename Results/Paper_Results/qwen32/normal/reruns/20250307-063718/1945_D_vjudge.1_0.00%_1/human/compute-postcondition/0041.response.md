Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill. `lista_A` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. `lista_B` is a list of n integers where each element `b_i` represents the additional cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the i-th and j-th positions during a swap. The function returns the minimum total cost Kirill needs to pay to reach a position no more than `k` from the front of the queue.**
