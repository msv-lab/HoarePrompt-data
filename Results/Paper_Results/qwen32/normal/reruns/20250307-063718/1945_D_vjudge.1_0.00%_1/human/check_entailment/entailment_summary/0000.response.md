Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to a position no more than `m` from the front of the queue, given the costs of individual swaps (`a_i`) and the additional costs for each person between the swapped positions (`b_i`).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`.
   - It reads the lists `a_i` and `b_i` and reverses both.
   - It calculates a prefix sum `pref` to keep track of the cumulative cost of swaps and additional costs.
   - It iterates through the reversed lists to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no more than `m` from the front.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `numero_testes`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

The key point here is how the function `func_1` processes the input and computes the result. The reversal of the lists `a_i` and `b_i` and the way the prefix sum `pref` is calculated and used suggest that the function is attempting to solve the problem by considering the reversed sequence of costs. This approach aligns with the problem's requirement to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to the desired position.

The problem description and the provided execution summaries indicate that the functions are designed to handle the input and compute the required result correctly. The function `func_1` processes each test case by calculating the minimum cost based on the given constraints, and `func_2` ensures that this process is repeated for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the functions appear to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
