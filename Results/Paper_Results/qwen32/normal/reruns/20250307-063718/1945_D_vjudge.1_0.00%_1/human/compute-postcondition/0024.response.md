The code snippet provided sets `soma_b` to 0. No other variables are modified in the code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the value of `soma_b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `soma_b` is 0.**
