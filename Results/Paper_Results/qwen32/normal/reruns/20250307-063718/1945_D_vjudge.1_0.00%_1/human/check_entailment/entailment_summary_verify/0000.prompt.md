You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `numero_testes` from the user input, which represents the number of tests to be performed. It then executes the function `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Logic for Swapping:**
   - The program attempts to reverse the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and then iterate through them to find the minimum cost. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the process of Kirill bribing people to move to the front of the queue.
   - The problem requires Kirill to potentially swap with multiple people and pay coins based on the `a_i` and `b_i` values. The current logic does not correctly account for multiple swaps and the associated costs.

2. **Handling of Costs:**
   - The program incorrectly accumulates `soma_b` and `pref` without correctly simulating the cost of bribing multiple people. The logic does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to pay `a_i` and `b_k` for each swap.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `m = 1` (Kirill wants to be at the front of the queue) or when `m = n` (Kirill is already within the allowed range).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
- **Expected Output:** `1` (Kirill can bribe the first person for `1` coin to move to the second position).
- **Actual Output:** The program will not correctly compute this, as it does not properly simulate the swapping and cost accumulation logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve a more nuanced simulation of the bribing process, potentially using a priority queue or dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to the desired position.

Since the provided program does not correctly handle these cases, it is incorrect.
