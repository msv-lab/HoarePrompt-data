The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the value of `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `resultado`, `pref`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`) are not directly modified by this line of code, but their conditions and relationships must still hold.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `resultado` is the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `soma_b` is `soma_b + lista_B[i]`**.

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `soma_b` has been updated to include `lista_B[i]`. The other conditions and values (`i`, `n`, `resultado`, `pref`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`) remain as specified in the initial state, with `n` still being greater than or equal to `k`, and `resultado` still being the minimum of its current value and the expression involving `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
