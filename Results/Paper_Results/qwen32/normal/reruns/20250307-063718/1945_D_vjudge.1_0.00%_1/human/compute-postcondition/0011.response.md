The code snippet provided is:

```
soma_b = 0
```

This line of code sets the variable `soma_b` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is `lista_A[i]`. The current element `lista_A[i]` is less than the current element `lista_B[i]`.**
