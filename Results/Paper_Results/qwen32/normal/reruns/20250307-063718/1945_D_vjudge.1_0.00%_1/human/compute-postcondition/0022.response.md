The code snippet `pref += soma_b` updates the value of `pref` by adding the value of `soma_b` to it. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b`**.

In natural language, this means that the value of `pref` has been increased by the value of `soma_b`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
