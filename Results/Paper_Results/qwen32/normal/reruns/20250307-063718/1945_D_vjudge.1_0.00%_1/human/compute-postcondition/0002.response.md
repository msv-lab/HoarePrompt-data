To determine the output state after the execution of the code snippet, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is not provided in the given information. Therefore, we can only infer the output state based on the information that `func_1()` is called, and no other changes to the variables are specified.

Since `numero_testes` is the only variable mentioned in the initial state and no changes to it are indicated by the code snippet, we can conclude that `numero_testes` remains unchanged. Additionally, there is no information provided about any other variables or their changes.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed.**
