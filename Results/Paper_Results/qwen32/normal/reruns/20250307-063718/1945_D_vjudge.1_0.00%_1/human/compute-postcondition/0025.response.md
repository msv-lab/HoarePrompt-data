Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `soma_b` is increased by the value of `lista_B[i]`.**

In simple terms: The value of `soma_b` has been updated by adding the value of `lista_B[i]` to it. All other variables retain their initial states except for `i`, which has been incremented by 2, and `soma_b`, which has been modified.
