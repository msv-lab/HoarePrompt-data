Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed `numero_testes` times.**

In simple terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the function `func_1()` will have been executed as many times as the value of `numero_testes`, which is an integer provided by the user and lies between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The value of `numero_testes` itself remains unchanged.
