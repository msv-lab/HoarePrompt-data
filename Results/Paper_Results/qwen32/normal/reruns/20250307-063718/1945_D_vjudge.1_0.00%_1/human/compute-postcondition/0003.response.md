The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`numero_testes`). Since the underscore is not used within the loop, we don't need to adjust it. The loop will execute as long as the range has not been exhausted.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, meaning that the loop counter (which is not explicitly shown but is managed internally by Python's `range`) would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the internal counter must be less than `numero_testes`.

Since the underscore `_` does not hold any state that we can or need to adjust, and `numero_testes` remains constant throughout the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the variables we can control.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed.**
