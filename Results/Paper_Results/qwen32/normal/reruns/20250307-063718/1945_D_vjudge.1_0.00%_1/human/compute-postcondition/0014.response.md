Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `soma_b` is 0 and `pref` is `lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]` and `pref` is 0.**
