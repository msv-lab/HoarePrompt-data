Output State: **`pref` is the cumulative sum of selected elements from `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values, `soma_b` is the sum of the remaining elements from `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Natural language: The value of `resultado` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
