The code snippet updates the `resultado` variable by taking the minimum value between its current value and the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are not altered by this code snippet, but the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `resultado` is the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`**.
