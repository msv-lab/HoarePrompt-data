The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop) and `numero_testes`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `numero_testes`.

Given that `numero_testes` is an integer input by the user and the loop will execute `numero_testes` times, at the start of each iteration, `numero_testes` remains the same, but the internal counter of the loop (which is not explicitly shown but is managed by Python's `range`) will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the internal counter (which is not directly accessible or modifiable by us) would have incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. However, since we can only adjust `numero_testes` and `_`, we do not need to change `numero_testes` itself because it represents the total number of iterations, not the current iteration count.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. The function `func_1()` has been executed.**
