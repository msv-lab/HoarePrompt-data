n is a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill. lista_A is a list of n integers where each element a_i represents the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. lista_B is a list of n integers where each element b_i represents the additional cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the i-th and j-th positions during a swap.
