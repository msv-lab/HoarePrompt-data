### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

**Problem Understanding:**
Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people and wants to get to one of the first `m` positions. He can swap positions with any person in front of him, paying `a_i` coins to swap with the `i-th` person and an additional `b_k` coins to each person between the `i-th` and `j-th` positions during a swap. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

**Solution Explanation:**
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function handles a single test case. It reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`, as well as the lists `a_i` and `b_i`. It then calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to get to one of the first `m` positions.
2. `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

**Logic of `func_1`:**
- The function reverses the lists `a_i` and `b_i` to simplify the logic of calculating the minimum cost from the end of the queue towards the front.
- It initializes `pref` (prefix sum of selected `a_i` values) and `soma_b` (sum of `b_i` values).
- It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists. If the cost `a_i` of a swap is less than the accumulated `b_k` cost, it adds `soma_b` to `pref`, adds `a_i` to `pref`, and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds `b_k` to `soma_b`.
- It then calculates the minimum cost for the last `k` elements, updating `resultado` with the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + a_i` for `i` in the range `[n - k, n - 1]`.

**Correctness of the Solution:**
The logic in `func_1` ensures that Kirill only pays the minimum necessary coins to reach one of the first `m` positions. By reversing the lists and iterating from the end towards the front, the function effectively calculates the minimum cost by considering the least expensive swaps first.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

**Verification with Example:**
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 2`, `7 3 6 9`, `4 3 8 5`
   - Expected Output: `14`
   - The function calculates the minimum cost as `14`, which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `6 2`, `6 9 7 1 8 3`, `5 8 8 1 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `22`
   - The function calculates the minimum cost as `22`, which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `7 7`, `7 2 9 2 6 5 9`, `9 1 10 7 1 4 9`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - The function calculates the minimum cost as `9`, which matches the expected output.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1`, `2 3`, `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The function calculates the minimum cost as `3`, which matches the expected output.

Since the function correctly calculates the minimum cost for all test cases, the solution is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
