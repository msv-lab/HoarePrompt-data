The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` adds the element at index `i` of `lista_B` to the variable `soma_b`. Given the initial state, the value of `soma_b` is updated by adding `lista_B[i]` to it. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged, and `i` is already incremented.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`.**
