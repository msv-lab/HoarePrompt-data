The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the variable `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Since `soma_b` was initially 0, it will now hold the value of `lista_B[i]`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`.**
