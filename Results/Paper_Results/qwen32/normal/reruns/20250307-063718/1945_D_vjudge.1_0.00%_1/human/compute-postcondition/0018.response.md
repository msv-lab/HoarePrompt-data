Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + lista_A[i]`, `soma_b` is 0.**

This means that the variables `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `i`, and `pref` retain their previous values with the only change being that `soma_b` is initialized to 0.
