The code snippet reassigns the value of `numero_testes` by taking an integer input from the user. The initial state of `numero_testes` is irrelevant because it is overwritten by the input. The precondition that `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4` must still hold true for the input value.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4.**
