The code snippet provided creates a new list `neg_prices` by taking the negative of each element in the `prices` list. This means that if `prices` contained positive values representing the prices of items, `neg_prices` will now contain the negative of those values.

Given the initial state:
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice
- `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob
- `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve
- `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `neg_prices`. It will now hold the negative values of the `prices` list.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
