Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `max_profit` is equal to the current `current_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to match the value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
