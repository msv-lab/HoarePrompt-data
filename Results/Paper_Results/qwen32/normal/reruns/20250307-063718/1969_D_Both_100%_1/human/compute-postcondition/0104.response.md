Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from the value determined by the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If `removed_item` is falsy, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` without subtracting `removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` minus `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]`. `max_profit` is equal to the current `current_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
