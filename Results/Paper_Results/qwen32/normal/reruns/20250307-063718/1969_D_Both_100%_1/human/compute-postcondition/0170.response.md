Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added, and if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0; `combined` must contain at least one element after the execution of the code. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**
