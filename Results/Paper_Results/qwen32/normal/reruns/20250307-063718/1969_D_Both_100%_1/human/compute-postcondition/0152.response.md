The code snippet `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)` updates the value of `current_profit` by calling the function `func_3` with `combined` and `heap` as arguments. The values of `combined`, `heap`, `removed_item`, `item`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, and `remaining_items` remain unchanged, except for `current_profit`.

Output State: **`combined` is not empty; `heap` contains up to `k` elements from the original `combined`; `combined` has `k` fewer elements; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `k` is 0.**
