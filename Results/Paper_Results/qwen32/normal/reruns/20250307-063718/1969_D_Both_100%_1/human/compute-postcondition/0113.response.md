Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has at least one element less than before; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the element that was last in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and the truthiness of `removed_item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is further decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`.**

In simple terms: The `current_profit` is reduced by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
