To determine what will be printed when the `print(max_profit)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Analysis of the Initial State:

1. **Heap and Combined**:
   - `heap` contains the last `k` elements from `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements).
   - `combined` is currently empty, which means `heap` is also empty or contains the last `k` items that were in `combined` before it was emptied.

2. **Removed Item and Item**:
   - `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped.
   - `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped. Since `combined` is empty, `item` must have been the last element added to `heap` and then popped.

3. **Current Profit and Max Profit**:
   - `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` for all items in `combined` and the truthiness of `removed_item` for all items in `combined`.
   - Since `combined` is empty, the adjustment to `current_profit` is based solely on the `item` that was added to `heap` and then popped, and the `removed_item`.
   - `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
   - `test_cases` is greater than 0, indicating there are multiple test cases to be processed.

### Final Output Determination:

Given that `combined` is empty, the primary factors influencing `current_profit` and `max_profit` are `item` and `removed_item`. However, without specific values for `item`, `removed_item`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated based on the adjustments made to `current_profit` using `item` and `removed_item`.
- Since `combined` is empty, the adjustments to `current_profit` are minimal and directly tied to the last operation involving `heap`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(max_profit)` statement will output the maximum profit calculated based on the operations involving `heap`, `item`, and `removed_item`.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit calculated based on the operations involving heap, item, and removed_item)**
