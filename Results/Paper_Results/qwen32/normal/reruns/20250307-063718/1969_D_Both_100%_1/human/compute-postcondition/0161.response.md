Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from the original `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped if `combined` was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `k` is 0; `combined` must contain at least one element after the execution of the code; the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0**
