Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the `combined` list in sorted order by the bonus; `combined` is `k` elements shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` is 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations, the `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were in the `combined` list, sorted by their bonus values. The `combined` list will have had `k` elements removed from it if it was not empty. The variables `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `test_cases` will remain unchanged from their initial values, except that `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished all its iterations.
