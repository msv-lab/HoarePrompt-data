The provided code snippet uses `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` to push `item` onto `heap` and then pop the smallest element from `heap`, assigning it to `removed_item`. This operation changes the contents of `heap` and updates `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, the impact on the variables is as follows:
- `heap` will have `item` added to it, and the smallest element will be removed.
- `removed_item` will be updated to the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped.
- Other variables (`combined`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` minus `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, `heap` is updated by adding `item` and removing the smallest element, and `removed_item` is set to the smallest element that was removed. All other variables remain as they were.
