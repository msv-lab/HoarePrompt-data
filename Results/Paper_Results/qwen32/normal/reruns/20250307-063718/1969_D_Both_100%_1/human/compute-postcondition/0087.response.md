Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` has `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements left and is not empty; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
