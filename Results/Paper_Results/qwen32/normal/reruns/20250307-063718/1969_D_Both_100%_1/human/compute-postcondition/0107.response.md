The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements from `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed.
- `combined` has one less element than before.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped.
- `item` is the last element that was in `combined`.
- `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and the truthiness of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` has at least one element.

State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has at least one element; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and the truthiness of `removed_item`; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
