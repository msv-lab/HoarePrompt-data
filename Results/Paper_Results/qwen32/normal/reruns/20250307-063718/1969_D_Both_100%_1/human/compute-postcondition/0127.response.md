Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with all items from `combined` added and the smallest elements removed; `combined` is empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` for all items in `combined` and the truthiness of `removed_item` for all items in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `combined` will be empty as all its elements have been processed. The `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were in `combined`, with the smallest elements being removed as new elements were added. The `current_profit` will have been adjusted based on the values of `item[0] + item[1]` and the elements removed from the heap. If this `current_profit` is the highest encountered during the loop, `max_profit` will be updated to this value. All other variables like `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
