The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the second element of the `item` tuple from `current_profit`.

Given the initial state, `current_profit` is calculated based on the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` or set to 0 if `combined` is empty. The `item` tuple has a second element (`item[1]`) that is subtracted from `current_profit`.

Therefore, the updated value of `current_profit` will be its previous value minus `item[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, and `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` minus `item[1]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
