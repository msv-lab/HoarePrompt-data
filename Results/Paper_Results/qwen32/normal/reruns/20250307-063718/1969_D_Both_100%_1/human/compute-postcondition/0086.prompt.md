Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonuses), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less element if it was not empty; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `combined` was not empty, `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`, `combined` has one less element, and `removed_item`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `combined` was not empty, `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`, `combined` has one less element, and `removed_item`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
