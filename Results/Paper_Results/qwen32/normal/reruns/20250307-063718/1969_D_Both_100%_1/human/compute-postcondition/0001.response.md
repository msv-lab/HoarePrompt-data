The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must be a positive integer. The other variables mentioned in the state description do not affect whether the loop will execute.

State: **`heap` is a list used as a min-heap, `remaining_items` is a list (initially empty in the context provided), `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
