### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program based on the provided functions and the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing Functions (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
    - `func_1` reads a single integer from the input, which should be the number of test cases.
    - `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object.
    - Both functions correctly parse the input as described.

2. **Profit Calculation Function (`func_3`)**:
    - `func_3` takes two parameters: `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`.
    - It calculates a total which is the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the elements of each tuple in `primary_items` where the sum of the elements of the tuple is non-negative.
    - This function seems to be calculating a part of the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`.

3. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
    - `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items `k` that Bob can take for free.
    - It also reads the list of prices for Alice (`prices`) and the list of bonuses for Bob (`bonuses`).
    - It creates a list `combined` of tuples containing the negative prices and the bonuses, sorted by the bonus values.
    - It then uses a min-heap (`heap`) to manage the items Alice should initially buy (up to `k` items).
    - It calculates the current profit using `func_3` and updates the maximum profit.
    - It iteratively updates the profit by removing items from the heap and adding new items, adjusting the profit accordingly.
    - Finally, it prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the input parsing for multiple test cases.
- The logic for calculating the profit involves maintaining a heap to manage the items Alice should initially buy and iteratively adjusting the profit based on the items Bob can take for free.
- The use of a heap ensures that the items with the highest bonuses are considered first, which aligns with the goal of maximizing Alice's profit.
- The function `func_3` correctly calculates a part of the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's maximum profit based on the problem description and the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
