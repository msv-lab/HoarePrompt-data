To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not provided in the context, we can't know exactly what it does or how it modifies the variables. 

However, if we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, then the output state will be the same as the initial state. The only thing that changes is the introduction of the `test_cases` variable, which is assigned the result of `func_1()`.

Therefore, the Output State will include `test_cases` as a new variable, which holds the result of `func_1()`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **heap is a list used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list (initially empty in the context provided), n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and combined is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`**.
