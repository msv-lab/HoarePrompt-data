Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: heap is a list used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list (initially empty in the context provided), n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and combined is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains all elements from `combined` in a heap structure, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with all items from `combined` added and the smallest elements removed; `combined` is empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` for all items in `combined` and the truthiness of `removed_item` for all items in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains up to `k` elements, `combined` is empty, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
