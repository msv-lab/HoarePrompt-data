Functionality: **The function accepts several parameters including `heap` (a list used as a min-heap), `remaining_items` (a list initially empty), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of items), `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n), `prices` (a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice), `neg_prices` (a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice), `bonuses` (a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob), `max_profit` (an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve), `current_profit` (an integer representing the current profit Alice has), and `combined` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, sorted based on the bonus values). The function calculates and returns the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selling the items to Bob, considering the constraints and relationships provided.**
