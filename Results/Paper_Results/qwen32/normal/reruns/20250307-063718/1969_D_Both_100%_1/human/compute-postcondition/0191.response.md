Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements, `combined` is empty, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `combined` list is empty because the loop continues to pop elements from `combined` until it is empty. The `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the last `k` items that were added to the heap during the loop's execution, with the smallest elements being removed as necessary to maintain the heap size of `k`.

The `removed_item` variable holds the smallest element that was in the heap before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped. The `item` variable holds the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped.

The `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items added to and removed from the heap. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, and `remaining_items` remain unchanged from their initial states or are updated as described in the loop, with `k` being reset to 0 at the end of the loop.
