Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from the original `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped if `combined` was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `max_profit` is less than `current_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `k` is 0. If `combined` was empty before reaching `k` iterations, none of these changes occur for the remaining iterations.**
