You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is a list used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list (initially empty in the context provided), n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and combined is sorted based on the bonus values.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()

            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:

            else:
                current_profit += item[0]

            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:

        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices` from the last iteration, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `test_cases` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is undefined (since the loop has finished), `removed_item` is undefined (since the loop has finished), `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap during the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts several parameters including `heap` (a list used as a min-heap), `remaining_items` (a list initially empty), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of items), `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n), `prices` (a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice), `neg_prices` (a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice), `bonuses` (a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob), `max_profit` (an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve), `current_profit` (an integer representing the current profit Alice has), and `combined` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, sorted based on the bonus values). The function calculates and returns the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selling the items to Bob, considering the constraints and relationships provided.
