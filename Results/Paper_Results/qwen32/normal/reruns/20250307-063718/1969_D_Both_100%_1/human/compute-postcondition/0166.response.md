Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added and `removed_item` is truthy; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` and `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `combined` was not empty, or `item[0]` if `combined` was empty, minus `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0; `combined` must contain at least one element after the execution of the code.**

Natural language: The value of `current_profit` has been decreased by `removed_item[0]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
