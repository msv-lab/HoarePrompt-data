To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and deduce the value of `max_profit`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`heap`**: Contains all elements from `combined` in a heap structure. Since `combined` is an empty list, `heap` is also an empty list.
2. **`combined`**: An empty list.
3. **`remaining_items`**: An empty list.
4. **`n` and `k`**: Returned by `func_2()`. Here, `k` is explicitly stated to be 0.
5. **`prices`**: The list returned by `func_2()`.
6. **`neg_prices`**: A list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
7. **`bonuses`**: The list returned by `func_2()`.
8. **`test_cases`**: Greater than 0.
9. **`item`**: The last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated. Since `combined` is empty, `item` has no specific value based on the given information.
10. **`removed_item`**: The item that was most recently popped from the heap. Since the heap is empty, no item has been popped, so `removed_item` has no specific value based on the given information.
11. **`current_profit`**: Adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap. Since no items have been pushed or popped, `current_profit` is likely initialized to 0.
12. **`max_profit`**: The maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop execution. Since `current_profit` is likely 0 and no adjustments have been made, `max_profit` is also 0.

### Analysis:
- The `heap` is empty, which means no operations (push or pop) have been performed on it.
- `combined` and `remaining_items` are empty lists, so no items have been added to or removed from them.
- `n` and `k` are returned by `func_2()`, but only `k` is explicitly stated to be 0. The values of `n` and the contents of `prices` and `bonuses` are not provided.
- Since no items have been added to the heap or `combined`, and no operations have been performed to adjust `current_profit`, it is reasonable to assume that `current_profit` remains at its initial value (which is likely 0).
- Consequently, `max_profit`, which tracks the maximum value of `current_profit`, is also 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution, which is 0.

Output: **0**
