The code snippet updates the `combined` list by zipping the `neg_prices` list with the `bonuses` list. This means each element in `combined` will be a tuple where the first element is the corresponding negative price from `neg_prices` and the second element is the corresponding bonus from `bonuses`.

Given that `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, the `combined` list will now contain tuples of these pairs.

The other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
