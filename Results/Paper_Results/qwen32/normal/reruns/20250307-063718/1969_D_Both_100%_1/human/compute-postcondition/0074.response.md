The code snippet `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a new list `combined` by zipping together the elements of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. This means that each element in `combined` will be a tuple where the first element is from `neg_prices` and the second element is from `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, `combined` was an empty list. After executing the code, `combined` will hold the zipped tuples of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by pairing an element from `neg_prices` with an element from `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0.**
