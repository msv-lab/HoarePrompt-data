The given Python code snippet sets `max_profit` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the value of `max_profit`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `combined` is empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` for all items in `combined` and the truthiness of `removed_item` for all items in `combined`; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`.**
