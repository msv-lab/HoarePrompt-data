The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple (the bonus). This means the order of tuples in `combined` will change to be in ascending order of their bonuses.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order by the bonus, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, the `combined` list is now sorted by the bonuses in ascending order, while all other variables remain unchanged.
