Output State: **`heap` contains all elements from `combined` in a heap structure, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop execution.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop, `combined` will be empty, and all its elements will have been processed and stored in `heap` as a heap structure. The `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculated during the loop, and `max_profit` will hold the highest profit encountered. All other variables, such as `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases`, will remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
