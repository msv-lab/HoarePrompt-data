The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the second element of the `item` tuple from `current_profit`. Therefore, the value of `current_profit` is updated to its previous value minus `item[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`heap` has one more element (the `item` that was pushed), `combined` has at least one less element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` from it, and `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
