Output State: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less element if it was not empty; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. If `combined` was not empty, its last element is now in `heap`, and `combined` has one less element. All other variables remain unchanged.
