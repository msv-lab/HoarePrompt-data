The code snippet `prices = list(func_2())` indicates that the `prices` variable is being reassigned to the list returned by the function `func_2()`. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this line of code.

Since `prices` is reassigned, the new state of `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`. The values of `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` remain the same as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
