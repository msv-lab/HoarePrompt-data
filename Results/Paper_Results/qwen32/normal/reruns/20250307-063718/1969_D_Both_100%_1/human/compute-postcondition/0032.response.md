Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, and `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.

```
current_profit -= item[1]
```

The value of `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`.**
