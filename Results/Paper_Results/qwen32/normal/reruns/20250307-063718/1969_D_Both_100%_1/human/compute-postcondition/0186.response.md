Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item` as per the given conditions; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. `combined` is not empty except for the last element which has been removed and assigned to `item`. `item` is the last element that was in `combined`.**

In simpler terms, the smallest element in the `heap` was removed and replaced with `item`. The `removed_item` is now the smallest element that was previously in the `heap`. The `current_profit` has been adjusted based on the conditions provided. All other variables remain unchanged except for `heap` and `removed_item`.
