For the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `combined` is not an empty list. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `combined` is not empty.
2. **Determine the necessary state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must have at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `combined` has one less element, we need to adjust `combined` to have at least one element again.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `combined`.

State: **`heap` has one more element (the `item` that was pushed), `combined` has at least one element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it if `removed_item` is not None, and `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
