Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices` from the last iteration, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` from the last iteration, `test_cases` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is undefined (since the loop has finished), `removed_item` is undefined (since the loop has finished), `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap during the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `heap` and `remaining_items` are empty. The variables `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` hold the values from the last iteration. The `test_cases` variable is 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The `combined` list is empty, and `item` and `removed_item` are undefined because the loop has ended. The `current_profit` reflects the final profit from the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved across all iterations.
