To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)`. However, the behavior of `func_3` is not specified in the given context. Therefore, we can only assume that `func_3` returns a value that is then assigned to `current_profit`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements of the `combined` list in sorted order by the bonus, and `k` is 0, so `heap` is an empty list.
- `combined` is not empty.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, with `k` being 0.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is 0.
- `current_profit` is 0.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Since `k` is 0, `heap` is an empty list. The function `func_3` is called with `combined` and `heap` as arguments, and its return value is assigned to `current_profit`. Without knowing the definition of `func_3`, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_profit` after the function call, but we can denote it as the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`.

The other variables (`combined`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `combined` is not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
