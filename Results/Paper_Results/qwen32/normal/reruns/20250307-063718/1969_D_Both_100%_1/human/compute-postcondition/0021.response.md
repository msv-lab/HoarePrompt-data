Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list if `combined` was not empty; `combined` is one element shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0. If `combined` was not empty, `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list and `combined` is one element shorter; otherwise, no changes are made to `heap` and `combined`.**
