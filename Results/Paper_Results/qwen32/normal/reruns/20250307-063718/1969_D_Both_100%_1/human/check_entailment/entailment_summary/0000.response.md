### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and analyze if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - `func_1` reads a single integer from the input, which is used to determine the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. This is used to read the values of `n`, `k`, the list of `a_i` (prices for Alice), and the list of `b_i` (prices for Bob).

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`:**
   - `func_4` initializes variables and reads the input for each test case.
   - It creates a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice (`-a_i`) and the price for Bob (`b_i`). This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap, which is used to keep track of the `k` items that Bob can take for free.
   - The list `combined` is sorted based on the price for Bob (`b_i`). This sorting ensures that items with higher `b_i` values are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing Alice's profit.
   - The first `k` items are pushed into a min-heap (`heap`), representing the items Bob can take for free.
   - The remaining items are stored in `combined` after the first `k` items are removed.
   - `func_3` is called to calculate the initial profit if Alice buys all remaining items and Bob takes the `k` items from the heap for free. This initial profit is stored in `current_profit`.
   - The code then iterates over the remaining items, adjusting the `current_profit` by considering each item's impact on the profit if Alice buys it and Bob takes the least profitable item from the heap for free.
   - The maximum profit encountered during the iteration is stored in `max_profit` and printed at the end of each test case.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing the initial profit from the heap and the profit from items in `primary_items` where the sum of the elements of the tuple is non-negative. This ensures that only profitable items are considered.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The sorting of `combined` ensures that items with higher `b_i` values are considered first, which is optimal for Alice.
- The use of a min-heap (`heap`) ensures that Bob always takes the least profitable item for free, which minimizes Alice's profit loss.
- The logic in `func_3` correctly calculates the total profit by considering only profitable items.
- The overall logic in `func_4` correctly handles the constraints and relationships provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles multiple test cases, sorts items based on `b_i`, uses a min-heap to track the `k` items Bob can take for free, and calculates the maximum profit Alice can achieve.

**Correctness: True**
