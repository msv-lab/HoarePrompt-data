Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is truthy (not None, not 0, not an empty string, etc.); if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, the `current_profit` has been adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it. All other conditions and states remain the same.
