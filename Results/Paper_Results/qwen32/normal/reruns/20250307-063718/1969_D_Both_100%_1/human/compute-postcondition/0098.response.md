The code snippet `current_profit += item[0]` increments the value of `current_profit` by the first element of the `item` tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements).
- `combined` has one less element than before.
- `removed_item` is unchanged.
- `item` is the last element that was in `combined` and satisfies `item[0] + item[1] < 0`.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.

The only variable that changes is `current_profit`, which is incremented by `item[0]`.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` and satisfies `item[0] + item[1] < 0`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
