Postcondition: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonuses), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0. The `combined` list contains at least one tuple.**
