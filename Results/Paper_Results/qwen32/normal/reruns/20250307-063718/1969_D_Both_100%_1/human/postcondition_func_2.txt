The function calculates and returns a total, which is the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the elements of each tuple in `primary_items` where the sum of the elements of the tuple is non-negative. The input lists `primary_items` and `secondary_heap` remain unchanged.
