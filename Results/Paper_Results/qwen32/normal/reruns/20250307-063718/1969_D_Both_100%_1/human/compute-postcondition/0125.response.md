The code snippet `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to `current_profit`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements) with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `combined` has one less element than before, and the last element of the previous `combined` is now stored in `item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and the truthiness of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
