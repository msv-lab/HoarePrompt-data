Output State: **`heap` has one more element (the `item` that was pushed), `combined` has one less element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it, `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

In simpler terms: The `current_profit` has been reduced by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
