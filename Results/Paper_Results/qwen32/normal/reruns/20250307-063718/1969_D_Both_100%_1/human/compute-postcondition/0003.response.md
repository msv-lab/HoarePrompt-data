The code snippet provided is `remaining_items = []`. This line of code reassigns the `remaining_items` variable to an empty list. The other variables (`heap`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
