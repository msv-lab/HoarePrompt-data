The code snippet provided sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple. This affects the order of elements in the `combined` list but does not change the values of the elements themselves or any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a pair of elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`.**

In simple terms, the `combined` list is now sorted based on the second element of each tuple, while all other variables remain unchanged.
