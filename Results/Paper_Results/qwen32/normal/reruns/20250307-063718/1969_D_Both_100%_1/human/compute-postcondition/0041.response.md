Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to `item`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language: The only change is that `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
