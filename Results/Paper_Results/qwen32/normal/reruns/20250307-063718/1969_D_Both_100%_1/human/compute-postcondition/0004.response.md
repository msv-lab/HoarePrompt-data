The given code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns a tuple containing two values that will be assigned to `n` and `k` respectively.

Given that `n` and `k` were initially described with specific conditions (n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n), after the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice gets from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
