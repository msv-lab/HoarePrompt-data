The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state of `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` must be greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order by the bonus, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
