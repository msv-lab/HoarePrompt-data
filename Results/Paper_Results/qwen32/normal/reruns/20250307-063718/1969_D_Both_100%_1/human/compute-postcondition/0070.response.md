The code snippet provided creates a new list `neg_prices` where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in the `prices` list. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state except for `neg_prices`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop execution.**

In natural language: The `neg_prices` list has been updated to contain the negative values of the elements in the `prices` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
