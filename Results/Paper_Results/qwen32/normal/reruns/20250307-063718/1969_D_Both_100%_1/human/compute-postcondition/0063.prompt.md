Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list if `combined` was not empty; `combined` is `k` elements shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` has one more element (the `item` that was pushed), `combined` has one less element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it if `removed_item` is not None, and `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` has the `item` that was pushed, `combined` has one more element (the `removed_item` that was popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is the same as before the if-else block.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
