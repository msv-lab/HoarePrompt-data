To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state so that the condition `while combined:` evaluates to `True`. This means that the `combined` list must not be empty.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `heap` is an empty list if `combined` was not empty.
- `combined` is `k` elements shorter if it was not empty.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.

The only variable in the loop head is `combined`. To ensure the loop can execute, `combined` must contain at least one element.

State adjustment:
- Since `combined` is `k` elements shorter if it was not empty and `k` is 0, `combined` should not be empty initially.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element when the loop starts.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
