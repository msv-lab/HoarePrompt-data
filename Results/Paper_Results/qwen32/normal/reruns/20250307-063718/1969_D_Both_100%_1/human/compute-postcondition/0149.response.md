Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element from the original `combined` if `combined` was not empty, plus the previous elements of `heap` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less element if it was not empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped if `combined` was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` and is also updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `k` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, no changes are made to `heap`, `combined`, `removed_item`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, or `remaining_items`.**
