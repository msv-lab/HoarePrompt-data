The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute `k` times, and the loop variable `_` will simply iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

Given that the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of other variables, the state of other variables like `heap`, `combined`, `removed_item`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remains unchanged with respect to the loop variable.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop variable `_` will have its next value in the range.

State: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less element if it was not empty; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
