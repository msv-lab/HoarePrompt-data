You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who are interacting in a game involving items with prices for both players. Alice aims to maximize her profit, while Bob aims to minimize it. The profit calculation involves the difference between what Bob pays Alice and what Alice spends on items.

### Key Points:
1. **Alice's Decision**: Alice can choose any subset of items to buy.
2. **Bob's Decision**: If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob takes all for free. Otherwise, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.
3. **Profit Calculation**: Alice's profit is the sum of what Bob pays minus the sum of what Alice spends.

### Strategy:
- **Optimal Alice Strategy**: Alice should choose items that maximize her profit, considering Bob's potential actions.
- **Optimal Bob Strategy**: Bob should minimize the items he pays for by choosing `k` items to take for free.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program uses a heap to efficiently manage the items and their associated profits. Here’s a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of free items `k`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice and Bob for each item.

2. **Item Combination**:
   - The program combines the negative prices for Alice and the bonuses for Bob into a single list of tuples.
   - This list is sorted based on the bonuses (second element of the tuple).

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a heap with the `k` items with the smallest bonuses (since they are sorted, the first `k` items are pushed into the heap).

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial profit by summing the bonuses of the remaining items and adjusting for the items in the heap.
   - It then iteratively processes the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap as it goes.

5. **Max Profit Update**:
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the process.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently manage the `k` items that Bob can take for free. This ensures that the items with the smallest bonuses are considered first, minimizing Alice's loss.
- **Profit Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the profit by considering the items Alice buys and the items Bob takes for free.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 (Bob takes all items for free) and when `n` is equal to `k` (Bob takes all items for free).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that the maximum profit for Alice is calculated under optimal play conditions.

Correctness: **True**
