Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order by the bonus, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last element of the `combined` list if `combined` is not empty; `combined` is one element shorter if `combined` was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last element of `combined` if `combined` is not empty; `combined` is one element shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` also contains the new last element that was just popped from `combined`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list if `combined` was not empty; `combined` is one element shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0. If `combined` was not empty, `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list and `combined` is one element shorter; otherwise, no changes are made to `heap` and `combined`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
