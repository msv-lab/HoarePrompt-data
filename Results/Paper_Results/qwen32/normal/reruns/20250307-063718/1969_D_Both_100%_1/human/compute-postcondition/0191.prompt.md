Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` contains up to `k` elements from the original `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped if `combined` was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `k` is 0. If `combined` was empty before reaching `k` iterations, none of these changes occur for the remaining iterations.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added, and if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0; `combined` must contain at least one element after the execution of the code. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item`, specifically `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item` as per the given conditions. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`. `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. `combined` is not empty except for the last element which has been removed and assigned to `item`. `item` is the last element that was in `combined`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
