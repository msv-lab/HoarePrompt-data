The code snippet uses `heapq.heappushpop`, which pushes an item onto a heap and then pops the smallest item from the heap. This means that `item` will be added to `heap`, and the smallest item in `heap` will be removed and assigned to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, `heap` is an empty list. When `item` is pushed onto `heap`, `heap` will contain `item` as its only element. Then, `heapq.heappushpop` will remove this item from `heap` and assign it to `removed_item`. Therefore, `removed_item` will be equal to `item`, and `heap` will be empty again.

The values of `combined`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, and `current_profit` are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to `item`, and `current_profit` is unchanged.**
