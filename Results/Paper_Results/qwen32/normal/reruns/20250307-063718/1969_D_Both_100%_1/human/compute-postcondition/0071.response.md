The code snippet provided assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. This means that `bonuses` will now hold the list returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`heap`, `combined`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `test_cases`, `item`, `removed_item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the items pushed and popped from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop execution.**
