Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that `current_profit` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
