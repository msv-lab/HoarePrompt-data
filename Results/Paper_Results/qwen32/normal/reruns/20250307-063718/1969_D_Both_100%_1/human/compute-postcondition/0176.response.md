The `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` operation pushes `item` onto the heap and then pops the smallest element from the heap. In this context, `item` is added to `heap` and the smallest element in `heap` (which was `removed_item` before `item` was added) is removed and assigned to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed, and `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added. After the operation, `heap` will still contain up to `k` elements, but now it will include `item` and exclude the previous smallest element (`removed_item`). The `removed_item` will be updated to the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.

`current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it. Additionally, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` from it. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`) remain unchanged. Since `k` is 0, the heap operations do not change the number of elements in the heap beyond the constraints already described.

Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0.**
