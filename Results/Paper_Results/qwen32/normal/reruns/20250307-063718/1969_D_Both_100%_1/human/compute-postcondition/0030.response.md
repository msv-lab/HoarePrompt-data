The code snippet `item = combined.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `combined` and assigns it to the variable `item`. Given that `combined` is not empty, after this operation, `combined` will have one less element than before. The variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`.**
