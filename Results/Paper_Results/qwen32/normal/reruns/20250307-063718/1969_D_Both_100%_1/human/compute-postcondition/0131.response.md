Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `combined` is empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` for all items in `combined` and the truthiness of `removed_item` for all items in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the only change is the addition of a new variable `remaining_items` which is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
