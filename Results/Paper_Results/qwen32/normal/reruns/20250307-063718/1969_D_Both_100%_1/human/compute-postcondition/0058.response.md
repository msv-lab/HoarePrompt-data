Output State: **`heap` has the `item` that was pushed, `combined` has one more element (the `removed_item` that was popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` from it. Otherwise, `current_profit` is adjusted by adding `item[0]` to it. In both cases, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

In simple terms: The `heap` now contains the `item` that was pushed, and the `combined` list has the `removed_item` that was popped from the heap. Other variables remain unchanged.
