To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables.

Here is the breakdown of the relevant information provided:

1. **heap**: Contains up to `k` elements. Since `k` is 0, `heap` is an empty list.
2. **combined**: Is initially empty.
3. **removed_item**: The smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped. Since `heap` is empty, `removed_item` has no meaningful value in this context.
4. **item**: The last element that was in `combined` before it was popped. Since `combined` is empty, `item` also has no meaningful value in this context.
5. **current_profit**: The value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0. Since `combined` is empty, `current_profit` remains 0.
6. **max_profit**: Equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. Since `current_profit` is 0 and `max_profit` is not explicitly mentioned to have any other value, `max_profit` is also 0.
7. **n and k**: The values returned by `func_2()`. `k` is explicitly stated to be 0.
8. **prices**: The list returned by `func_2()`.
9. **neg_prices**: A list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
10. **bonuses**: The list returned by `func_2()`. It is updated to the list returned by `func_2()` again later.
11. **test_cases**: Greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
12. **remaining_items**: An empty list.

Given these details, the most critical piece of information for the `print(max_profit)` statement is that `max_profit` is determined to be 0 because `current_profit` is 0 and `max_profit` is initialized or remains 0 since there is no indication of it being updated to a different value.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **0**
