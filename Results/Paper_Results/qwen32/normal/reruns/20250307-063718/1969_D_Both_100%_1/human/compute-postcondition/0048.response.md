Output State: **`heap` has one more element (the `item` that was pushed), `combined` has one less element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation, `removed_item` is the item that was popped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the conditions provided, `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

In natural language: The `heap` now contains one additional element, which is the `item` that was pushed onto it. The `combined` list has one less element than before because an item was popped from it. The `remaining_items` list remains empty. The variables `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` retain their previous values. The `item` variable holds the last element that was in `combined` before the `pop()` operation. The `removed_item` variable now holds the item that was popped from the heap. The `current_profit` is adjusted based on the conditions provided: if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, it is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, it is increased by `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy. The `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.
