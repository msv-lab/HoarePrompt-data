The provided code snippet removes the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `heap` was initially an empty list. After the operation, it contains the last element that was in `combined`.
- `combined` originally had at least one tuple. After the operation, it has one less tuple, specifically the last tuple has been removed.
- The `removed_item` variable is not directly affected by this operation.
- The `item` variable is not directly affected by this operation.
- The `current_profit` and `max_profit` variables remain unchanged.
- The `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` variables remain unchanged.
- The `test_cases` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`; `combined` has one less element; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
