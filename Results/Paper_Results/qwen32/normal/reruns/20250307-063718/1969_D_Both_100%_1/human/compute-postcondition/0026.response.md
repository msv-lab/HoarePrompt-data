Postcondition: **`heap` is an empty list if `combined` was not empty; `combined` is `k` elements shorter if it was not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is less than `current_profit`; `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
