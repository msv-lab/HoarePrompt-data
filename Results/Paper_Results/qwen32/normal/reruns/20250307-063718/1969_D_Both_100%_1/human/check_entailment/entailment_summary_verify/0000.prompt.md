You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function calculates and prints the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selling items to Bob, considering the constraints and relationships provided. It processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of item prices, corresponding bonuses, and a limit on the number of items Alice can initially select for a special offer.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Heap Initialization and Usage**:
   - The heap is initialized with `k` items from the combined list, but the logic for updating the heap and calculating the profit is flawed.
   - The `heapq.heappushpop` function is used incorrectly. It should be used to maintain the heap of the `k` items with the smallest `a_i - b_i` values, but the code does not correctly handle the profit updates when items are pushed and popped from the heap.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The `func_3` function calculates the total profit by summing the `b_i` values of items in the heap and adding the `a_i + b_i` values of items in `primary_items`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal selection of items to maximize Alice's profit.
   - The profit calculation logic in the main loop (`func_4`) does not correctly handle the situation where Bob takes `k` items for free and Alice sells the remaining items to Bob.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is 0 or `k` is equal to `n` (i.e., Bob takes all items for free or Bob takes all items and pays for none).

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
- Alice should buy all items (since `k = 2` and Bob will take 2 items for free).
- Bob will take the two items with the smallest `a_i` values (i.e., items 1 and 2).
- Bob will pay for item 3, so Alice's profit is `6 - 3 = 3`.

However, the provided code does not handle this correctly and will likely output a different profit.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
