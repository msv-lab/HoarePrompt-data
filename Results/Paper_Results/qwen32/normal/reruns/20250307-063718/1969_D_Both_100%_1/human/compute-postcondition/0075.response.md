The code snippet sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple. This means that the tuples in `combined` will be ordered by the values in the `bonuses` list, which is the second element of each tuple in `combined`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonuses), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before the loop terminated, `removed_item` is the item that was most recently popped from the heap, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0.**

In simple terms, the `combined` list has been reordered so that the tuples are now sorted by the bonus values. All other variables remain unchanged.
