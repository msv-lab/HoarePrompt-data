The code snippet `bonuses = list(func_2())` updates the `bonuses` variable by assigning it the list returned by the function `func_2()`. This means that the previous value of `bonuses` is replaced by the new list returned by `func_2()`.

All other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and the bonus of an item, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
