Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less element if it was not empty; `removed_item` is unchanged; `item` is unchanged; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
