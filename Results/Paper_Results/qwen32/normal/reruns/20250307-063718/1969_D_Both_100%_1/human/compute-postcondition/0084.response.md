The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. This means that `combined` will have one less element, and `heap` will contain this newly added element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If `combined` was not empty, `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`, `combined` has one less element, and `removed_item`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
