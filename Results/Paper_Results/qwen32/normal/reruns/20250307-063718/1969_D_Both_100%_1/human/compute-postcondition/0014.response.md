The code snippet provided involves pushing the last element of the `combined` list into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`, and then removing that element from the `combined` list using `pop()`. This operation modifies the `heap` and `combined` list but does not affect the other variables.

Here's the detailed impact:

- The `heap` list, which was initially empty, now contains the last element of the `combined` list.
- The `combined` list is now one element shorter, as the last element has been removed and pushed into the `heap`.

The other variables (`remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last element of the `combined` list; `combined` is one element shorter; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
