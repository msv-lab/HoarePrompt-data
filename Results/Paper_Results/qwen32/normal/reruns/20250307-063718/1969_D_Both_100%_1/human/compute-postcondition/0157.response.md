To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, the condition `while combined:` must be satisfied. This means that the `combined` list must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `combined` to ensure it contains at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the condition**: The loop will execute if `combined` is not empty.
2. **Adjust the state**: To satisfy the condition, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element.

Given the initial state, `combined` might be empty, so we need to modify it to contain at least one element.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from the original `combined` if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has `k` fewer elements if it was not empty; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the last `item` was added and the smallest element was popped if `combined` was not empty; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`; `k` is 0; `combined` must contain at least one element.**

This ensures that the `while` loop can execute at least once.
