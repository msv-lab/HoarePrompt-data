Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the heap before `item` was added; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item`, specifically `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `bonuses` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`, `k` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
