The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` modifies the `heap` and `combined` variables. It removes the last element from the `combined` list using `pop()` and pushes this element into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush()`. The `heap` is a min-heap, meaning the smallest element is always at the root. The `combined` list loses its last element as a result of the `pop()` operation. 

Given the initial state, `heap` contains the last element of the `combined` list if `combined` is not empty. After the code execution, `heap` will contain the previous last element of `combined` and the new last element that was just popped from `combined`. The `combined` list will have one less element than it did before the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the previous last element of `combined` and the new last element that was just popped from `combined`; `combined` is one element shorter; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` where `k` is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
