The `while` loop in the provided code snippet continues as long as the `combined` list is not empty. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `combined` list must contain at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `combined` is a list with one less element than before. To make sure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` contains at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` must contain at least one element, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` with `k` being 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**
