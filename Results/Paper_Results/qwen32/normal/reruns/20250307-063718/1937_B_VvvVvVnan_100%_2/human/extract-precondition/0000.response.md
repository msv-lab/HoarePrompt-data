Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 x n grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
