Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1 but still less than `m` (so `m` must be at least `j + 3`), `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so the condition that `j` is still less than `m` must now hold for `j + 1`, meaning `m` must be at least `j + 3`. The conditions `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain unchanged as they depend on the new value of `j`.
