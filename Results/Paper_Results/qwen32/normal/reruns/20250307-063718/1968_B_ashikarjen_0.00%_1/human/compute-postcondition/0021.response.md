The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The condition `j` is less than `m` still holds (since we are only incrementing `j` by 1, and it was previously less than `m`). The condition `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` is still valid because the code snippet does not modify `b[j]` or `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1 but still less than `m`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1 but still less than `m`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
