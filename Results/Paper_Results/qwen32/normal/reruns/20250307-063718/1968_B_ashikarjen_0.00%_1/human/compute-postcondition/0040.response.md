To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions that will cause the loop to terminate. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`. 

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `j` is incremented to 1, and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
- After the second iteration, `j` is incremented to 2, and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
- After the third iteration, `j` is incremented to 3, and `b[3]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

The loop will terminate when either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Since we are not given any information that `b[j]` equals `a[i]` for any `j`, we assume the loop will terminate because `j` reaches `m`.

Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `m`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `m`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `m`, and the values of `i` and `n` will remain the same as they were before the loop started.
