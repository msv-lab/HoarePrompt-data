Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input, `j` is either `m` or the index where `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. If `j` was less than `m`, `k` is set to 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0 and `j` is not less than `m`.**
