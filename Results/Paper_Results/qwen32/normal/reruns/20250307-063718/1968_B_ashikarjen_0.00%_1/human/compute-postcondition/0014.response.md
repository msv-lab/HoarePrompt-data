The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input, `k` is 1, `j` is either `m` or the index where `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.
