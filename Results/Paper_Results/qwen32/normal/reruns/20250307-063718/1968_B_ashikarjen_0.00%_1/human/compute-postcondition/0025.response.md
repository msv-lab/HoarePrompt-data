The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented again, effectively making `j` two increments larger than its original value. The conditions `j + 1` is still less than `m` and `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain valid after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 2, `j + 1` is still less than `m`, `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.
