Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `j` is still equal to `m` with the condition that `j` is greater than or equal to `m`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
