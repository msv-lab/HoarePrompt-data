The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `j` is 2, after the operation `j += 1`, the value of `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 3, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input such that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 3**.
