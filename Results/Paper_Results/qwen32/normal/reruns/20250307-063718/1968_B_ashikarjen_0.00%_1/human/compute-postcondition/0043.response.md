The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Initially, `j` was `m`, so now `j` is `m + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`**
