The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `b[j] is not equal to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `b[j] is not equal to `a[i]`**.
