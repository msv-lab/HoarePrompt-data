The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The loop termination condition and the value of `j` being less than `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop terminates because `b[j]` equals `a[i]`, and the current value of `j` is less than `m`; `k` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **The loop terminates because `b[j]` equals `a[i]`, and the current value of `j` is less than `m`; `k` is incremented by 1.**
