To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `k` and `j` based on the given initial state. However, the problem statement does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`, nor does it specify any code that calculates `k` and `j`. Therefore, we can only describe `k` in terms of the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `k` is defined as the number of characters in `a` that were found in `b` in the same order.
- `j` is defined as the index in `b` where the search stopped. However, `j` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to determine its value for this particular output.

Since `k` is dependent on the specific values of `a` and `b`, we can't provide a numerical value for `k`. Instead, we describe `k` in terms of `a` and `b`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that were found in `b` in the same order)**
