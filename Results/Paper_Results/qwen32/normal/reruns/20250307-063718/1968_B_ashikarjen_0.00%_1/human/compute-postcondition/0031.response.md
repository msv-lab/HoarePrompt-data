Output State: **The loop terminates because `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Additionally, `j` is not less than `m` and we break out of the most internal loop.**
This output state indicates that the loop has terminated due to the condition where `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Furthermore, it is explicitly mentioned that `j` is not less than `m`, and the loop has been exited using the `break` statement.
