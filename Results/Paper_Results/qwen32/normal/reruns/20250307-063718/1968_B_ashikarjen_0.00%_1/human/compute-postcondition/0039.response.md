The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `j` is 2, after the increment, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[j] is not equal to `a[i]`**.
