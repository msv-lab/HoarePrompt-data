Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input, `j` is either `m` or the index where `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. If `j` was less than `m`, `k` is set to 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0 and `j` is not less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop terminates because either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. If `b[j]` equals `a[i]` and `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` is not less than `m` and we break out of the most internal loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is either `m` or `m + 1` depending on whether `j` was initially less than `m` or not. If `j` was less than `m`, then `k` is `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
