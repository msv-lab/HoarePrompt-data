To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `b[j] is not equal to a[i]`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **`j < m`**: Since `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, `j` is indeed less than `m`. No adjustment is needed for this condition.

2. **`b[j] != a[i]`**: The problem states that `b[j] is not equal to a[i]`, so this condition is also satisfied. No adjustment is needed for this condition either.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given state, the loop can certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `b[j] is not equal to `a[i]`**
