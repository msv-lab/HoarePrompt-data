Output State: **The loop terminates because either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop stops because either `j` has reached or exceeded the value of `m`, or the element at index `j` in array `b` matches the element at index `i` in array `a`.
