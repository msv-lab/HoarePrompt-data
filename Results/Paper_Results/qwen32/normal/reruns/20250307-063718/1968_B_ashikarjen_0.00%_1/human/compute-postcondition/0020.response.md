To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` does not appear in the loop condition, so it can be ignored for this task).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though this is after the loop starts, so it does not affect the initial execution).

The loop condition is:
```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
```

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the following conditions need to be met:
1. `j` must be less than `m`.
2. `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Let's break it down:
- `j` and `m` are the only variables directly related to the first part of the condition (`j < m`), so `j` must be a value less than `m`.
- `b[j]` and `a[i]` are the variables related to the second part of the condition (`b[j] != a[i]`), so `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Since `i` is incremented after the loop starts, the value of `i` right before the loop does not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition itself. However, `j` must be initialized to a value less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Let's choose a specific example to illustrate:
- Assume `m` is 5 (so `j` can be any value from 0 to 4).
- Assume `i` is 0 (since `i` is incremented after the loop starts, its initial value doesn't affect the first iteration).
- Assume `a[0]` is 10.
- Assume `b[0]` is 20 (so `b[j] != a[i]` is satisfied).

Thus, a valid state before the loop could be:
- `j` is 0 (or any value less than `m`).
- `m` is 5.
- `b[0]` is 20 (or any value not equal to `a[0]`).
- `a[0]` is 10.

State: **`j` is 0, `m` is 5, `b[0]` is 20, `a[0]` is 10**

However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop condition and not specific values, the most generalized state would be:
State: **`j` is less than `m`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
