The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. The termination conditions mentioned in the problem statement are related to the inner loop and do not affect the outer loop's iteration variable `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop terminates because either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Regardless of the termination reason for the inner loop, the outer loop's variable `i` would have been incremented by 1 if it had not yet reached `n`.

So, for the outer loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `i` and adjust it to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
