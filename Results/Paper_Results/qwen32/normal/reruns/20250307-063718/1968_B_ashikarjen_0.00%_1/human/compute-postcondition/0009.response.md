The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial value of `j` is 1, so after the operation, `j` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 2, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the binary string read from the input, `b` is the string read from the input such that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 2**.
