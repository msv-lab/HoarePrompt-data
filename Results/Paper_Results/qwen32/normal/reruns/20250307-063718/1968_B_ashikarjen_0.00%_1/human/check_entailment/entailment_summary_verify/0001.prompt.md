You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of characters in `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order. The function does not modify the input strings or the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. The task is to find the maximum possible number \( k \) such that the prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings \( a \) and \( b \), then the strings \( a \) and \( b \) themselves.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes \( k \) to 0, which will count the length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
   - It also initializes \( j \) to 0, which is used to track the position in string \( b \).

3. **Finding the Maximum Prefix:**
   - The program iterates over each character in string \( a \) using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the first occurrence of the current character of \( a \) in \( b \) starting from position \( j \).
   - If the character is found (i.e., \( j < m \)), it increments \( k \) and moves to the next character in \( a \) by incrementing both \( i \) (implicitly via the for loop) and \( j \).
   - If the character is not found (i.e., \( j \geq m \)), it breaks out of the loop, indicating that no further characters of \( a \) can be matched as a subsequence in \( b \).

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of \( k \), which represents the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program correctly identifies the longest prefix of \( a \) that can be matched as a subsequence in \( b \).
- The use of two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) ensures that each character of \( a \) is matched against the remaining characters of \( b \) in a linear fashion, making the solution efficient.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when \( a \) is longer than \( b \) or when \( b \) does not contain any character of \( a \).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.
