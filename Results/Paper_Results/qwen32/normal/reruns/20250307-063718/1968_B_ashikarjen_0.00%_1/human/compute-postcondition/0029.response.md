The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` now holds the value `j + 1`. The loop terminates because `b[j]` equals `a[i]`, and this condition is still valid since the termination condition is based on the values of `a[i]` and `b[j]` before the increment. The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` now holds the value `k + 1`. The values of `a[i]`, `b[j]`, `m`, and the condition for the loop termination remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop terminates because `b[j]` equals `a[i]`, and the current value of `j` is `j + 1` (which is less than `m`); `k` is `k + 1`.**
