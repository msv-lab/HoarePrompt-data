You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if we can equalize the water in all containers by only pouring water from a container to a container that comes after it in the sequence.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which ensures that there is a possible target amount of water (mean) that each container can hold to be equalized.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container.

#### Analysis:
- The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if they are to be equalized.
- It then iterates through the containers and keeps a running balance (`curr`) of how much water is needed or excess in the containers up to the current container.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) is negative, it means the current container does not have enough water to meet the required mean up to that point, and there is no way to pour water from a previous container to compensate since all previous containers have already been considered. Therefore, it returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and it returns "YES".

#### Validation:
- The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program:
  - For the case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is possible to equalize the water.
  - For the case `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is not possible to equalize the water.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be equalized under the given constraints.
