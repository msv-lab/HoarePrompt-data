### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring there is a target mean amount of water each container should have.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container.

#### Analysis:
- The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if they are to be equalized.
- It then iterates through the containers and maintains a running balance (`curr`) of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target mean up to the current container.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) is negative, it means that the cumulative water up to that point is less than the required amount, and since no water can be poured from future containers to previous ones, it returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and it returns "YES".

#### Validation:
- The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program:
  - For the case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is possible to equalize the water.
  - For the case `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is not possible to equalize the water.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program and the annotations. The annotations and the original assessment incorrectly state that `nums` is a list of lists, which is not accurate based on the input parsing. Let's correct this:

- In the main loop, `nums` is correctly parsed as a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case.
- The function `func_1` is called with this list of integers.

#### Correct Annotations:

- **State before function call**: `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for a single test case.
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - `n` is the number of containers.
  - `total` is the sum of the water in the containers.
  - `mean` is the target amount of water each container should have.
  - `curr` is the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target mean up to the current container.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
- The logic of maintaining a running balance (`curr`) is correct. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the cumulative water up to that point is less than the required amount, and no water can be poured from future containers to previous ones, so the function correctly returns "NO".
- If `curr` never goes negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and the function correctly returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be equalized under the given constraints.

Final: **True**
