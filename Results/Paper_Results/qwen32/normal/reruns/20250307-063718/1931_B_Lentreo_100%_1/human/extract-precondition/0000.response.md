Precondition: **nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case consisting of two parts: the first part is a list containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
