### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if we can equalize the water in all containers by only pouring water from a container to a container that comes after it in the sequence.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which ensures that there is a possible target amount of water (mean) that each container can hold to be equalized.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container.

#### Analysis:
- The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if they are to be equalized.
- It then iterates through the containers and keeps a running balance (`curr`) of how much water is needed or excess in the containers up to the current container.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) is negative, it means the current container does not have enough water to meet the required mean up to that point, and there is no way to pour water from a previous container to compensate since all previous containers have already been considered. Therefore, it returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and it returns "YES".

#### Validation:
- The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program:
  - For the case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is possible to equalize the water.
  - For the case `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is not possible to equalize the water.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be equalized under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
