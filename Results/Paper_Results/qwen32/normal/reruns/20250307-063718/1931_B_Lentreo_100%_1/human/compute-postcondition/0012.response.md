The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`nums`, `total`, `mean`, `curr`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 1, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0**
