The code snippet increments `curr` by the difference between the first inner list of `nums` and `mean`. The values of `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain unchanged, while `curr` is updated. `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0**.
