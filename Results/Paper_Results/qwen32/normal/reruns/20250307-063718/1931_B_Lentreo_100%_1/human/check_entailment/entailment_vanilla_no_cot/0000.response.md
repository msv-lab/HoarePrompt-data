Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of containers and the amount of water in each container. This is done correctly using `input()` and `map()` functions.

2. **Check Divisibility**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. This is done by `total % n != 0`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is not necessary and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

3. **Calculate Mean**: The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have, which is `total // n`.

4. **Check Balance**: The program iterates through the containers and keeps a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the containers using the allowed operations, and the program returns 'NO'. This is because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than it should have and there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance it out.

5. **Return Result**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the containers, and the program returns 'YES'.

The logic and implementation of the program are correct and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
