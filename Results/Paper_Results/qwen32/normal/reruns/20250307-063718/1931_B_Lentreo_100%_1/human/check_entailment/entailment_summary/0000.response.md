### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the observation that for the water to be evenly distributed among the containers, the cumulative sum of water levels (after adjusting each container's water level to the mean) should never go below zero. This is because if the cumulative sum goes below zero at any point, it implies that there is not enough water available in the previous containers to fulfill the requirement of the subsequent containers to reach the mean level.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Calculate the Mean:** The program first calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after redistribution (`mean = total // n`).
2. **Check Cumulative Sum:** It then iterates through the list of water amounts, adjusting each container's water level by subtracting the mean from it and maintaining a cumulative sum of these adjustments (`curr += nums[i] - mean`).
3. **Validation:** If at any point the cumulative sum (`curr`) becomes negative, the program returns 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to redistribute the water to meet the requirement. If the loop completes without the cumulative sum going negative, the program returns 'YES'.

The logic is correct because:
- If the cumulative sum of water levels (adjusted by the mean) never goes negative, it means that the water can be redistributed such that all containers eventually have the mean amount of water.
- If the cumulative sum goes negative, it indicates that there is a point where the water in the preceding containers is insufficient to meet the requirement of the subsequent containers, making it impossible to achieve equal distribution.
