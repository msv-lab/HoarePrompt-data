nums is a list of integers where each integer represents the amount of water in a container, and the length of nums (n) is such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of the integers in nums is divisible by n. The function is called once per test case, and there are t test cases where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each integer in nums satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^9.
