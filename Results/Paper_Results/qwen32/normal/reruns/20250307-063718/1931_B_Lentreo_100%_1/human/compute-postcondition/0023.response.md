Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. It accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case with a specified number of containers and their respective water amounts. If the water can be evenly distributed in all test cases, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
