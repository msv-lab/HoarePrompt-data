Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current total water and the desired mean water level ever goes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels.

Here's a counterexample where the program will output "NO" but the correct answer should be "YES":

Consider the test case:
```
1
4
1 2 4 3
```

Explanation of the test case:
- The total amount of water is 10, and since there are 4 containers, the target amount of water per container is 2.5. However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, we know that the target amount per container should be an integer. In this case, the target amount is 2.
- The program will iterate through the containers and calculate the cumulative difference:
  - After the first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (which is less than 0, so it will return "NO").

However, it is possible to equalize the water levels:
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the second container: [2, 3, 2, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the second container: [2, 4, 2, 2]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 3, 3, 2]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the second container to the third container: [2, 2, 4, 2]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 4]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the fourth container to the third container: [2, 2, 3, 3]
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the fourth container: [2, 2, 2, 2]

Thus, the correct answer is "YES", but the program will incorrectly return "NO" for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
