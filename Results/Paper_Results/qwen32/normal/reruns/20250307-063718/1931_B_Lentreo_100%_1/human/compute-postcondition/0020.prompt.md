Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case consisting of two parts: the first part is a list containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`. `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases. Additionally, `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`. `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    curr += nums[i] - mean
    if curr < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, `i` is 1, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean + nums[i] - mean`, `i` is 2, and if `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
