You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case consisting of two parts: the first part is a list containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case consisting of two parts: the first part is a list containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`. `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases. Additionally, `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `curr` is the sum of `(nums[i] - mean)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning anything.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a test case consisting of two parts: the first part is a list containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns 'NO' for the first four test cases and 'YES' for the fifth test case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
