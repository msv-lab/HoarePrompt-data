The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the total number of test cases.

The other variables (`nums`, `total`, `mean`, `curr`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop head criteria.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning anything.**
