Output State: **`curr` is the sum of `(nums[i] - mean)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning anything.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `curr` will hold the cumulative sum of the differences between each test case's water amount and the mean water amount across all test cases. The loop iterates through each test case, updating `curr` accordingly. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function immediately returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it finishes normally without returning anything.
