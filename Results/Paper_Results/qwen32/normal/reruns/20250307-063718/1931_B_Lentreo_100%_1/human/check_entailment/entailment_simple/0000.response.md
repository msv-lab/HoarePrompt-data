### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The operation allows pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The key insight is that for it to be possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount (which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers) should never be negative as we iterate through the containers from left to right. This is because we can only pour water from earlier containers to later ones, so if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we would need to pour water from a later container to an earlier one, which is not allowed.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:

1. It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
2. It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the current amount of water and the target amount (`curr`).
3. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the equal distribution using the allowed operation, and the function returns 'NO'.
4. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

The annotated state of the program before the function call is incorrect. The `nums` variable should be a list of integers representing the amounts of water in a single test case, not a list of lists. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to handle a single test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The annotated state of the program before the function call is incorrect, which could lead to confusion. However, the logic within `func_1` is correct. If we assume the correct input format (a single list of integers for each test case), the function would work as intended. Therefore, the core logic is correct, but the annotation is misleading. Given the task is to determine the correctness based on the provided annotation, the answer is False.
