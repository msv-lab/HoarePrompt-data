Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in `func_1` is flawed, and the description of the state before the function call is incorrect.

1. **Incorrect State Description Before Function Call:**
   - The state description before the function call is incorrect. `nums` is not a list of lists. Instead, `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for a single test case. The number of containers `n` and the list `nums` are read separately for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` assumes `nums` is a list of integers for a single test case.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean = total // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list `nums` and maintains a cumulative sum `curr` of the differences between each container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. This check is incorrect because the operation allows transferring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`. Therefore, the cumulative difference should never go negative if redistribution is possible.
   - The function returns 'YES' if the loop completes without `curr` going negative. This is not a correct condition for determining if redistribution is possible.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
   - The correct approach would be to ensure that the cumulative sum of differences never goes negative, but the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the cumulative difference should never go negative at any point during the iteration, which is not the correct condition.

Correctness: **False**
