The code snippet `curr += nums[i] - mean` modifies the value of `curr` by adding `nums[i] - mean` to its current value. Given the initial state, `curr` is initially `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`. After executing the code, `curr` will be updated to `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean + nums[i] - mean`.

The other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists with at least one inner list, `n` is the number of test cases in `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the amounts of water across all test cases, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean + nums[i] - mean`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning anything.**
