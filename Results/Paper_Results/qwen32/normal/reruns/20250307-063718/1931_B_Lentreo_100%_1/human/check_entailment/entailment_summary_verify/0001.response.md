Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from container i to container j where i < j.
- The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that a target mean exists.
- We can only pour water from an earlier container to a later container.

### Program Code Recap:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. It accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers representing the water amounts in the containers. If the water can be evenly distributed, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if they are to be equalized.
- It then iterates through the containers and keeps a running balance (`curr`) of how much water is needed or excess in the containers up to the current container.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) is negative, it means the current container does not have enough water to meet the required mean up to that point, and there is no way to pour water from a previous container to compensate since all previous containers have already been considered. Therefore, it returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and it returns "YES".

### Validation:
- The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program:
  - For the case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is possible to equalize the water.
  - For the case `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly identifies that it is not possible to equalize the water.

### Analysis:
Let's consider the logic of the program:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The program correctly checks if the total sum is divisible by `n` and calculates the mean.
2. **Running Balance Calculation**: The program maintains a running balance (`curr`) which tracks the cumulative difference between the actual water and the target mean up to the current container.
3. **Negative Balance Check**: If at any point the running balance (`curr`) is negative, it means that the current container and all previous containers do not have enough water to meet the target mean up to that point. Since we can only pour water from earlier to later containers, this situation implies that it is impossible to equalize the water.

The logic seems correct based on the problem constraints and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be equalized under the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
