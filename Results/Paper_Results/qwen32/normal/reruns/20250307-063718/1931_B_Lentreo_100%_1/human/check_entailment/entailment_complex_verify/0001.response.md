### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that there is a target mean amount of water each container can hold.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program calculates the mean amount of water (`mean`) that each container should have if they are to be equalized.
- It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of the difference between the current total water and the target total water up to the current container.
- If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it indicates that the current container does not have enough water to meet the required mean up to that point, and there is no way to pour water from a previous container to compensate since all previous containers have already been considered. Therefore, it returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it means that the water can be rearranged to meet the required mean for all containers, and it returns "YES".

#### Validation with Example Cases:
- **Case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`**:
  - Mean = (4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) / 5 = 3
  - Iteration:
    - `i=0`: `curr = 4 - 3 = 1`
    - `i=1`: `curr = 1 + (5 - 3) = 3`
    - `i=2`: `curr = 3 + (2 - 3) = 2`
    - `i=3`: `curr = 2 + (1 - 3) = 0`
    - `i=4`: `curr = 0 + (3 - 3) = 0`
  - Since `curr` never goes negative, the program returns "YES".
  
- **Case `[1, 2, 3]`**:
  - Mean = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2
  - Iteration:
    - `i=0`: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1`
  - Since `curr` goes negative, the program returns "NO".

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations indicate that `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for a single test case.
- The annotations also correctly describe the state of the program at various points, including the calculation of `mean` and the running balance `curr`.
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies when `curr` goes negative and returns "NO" accordingly.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be equalized under the given constraints. The annotations accurately describe the program's behavior and confirm the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
