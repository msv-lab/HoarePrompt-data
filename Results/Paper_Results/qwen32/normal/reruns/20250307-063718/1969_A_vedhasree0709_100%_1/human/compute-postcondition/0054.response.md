Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `p` is the second element of the list `l`, `q` is the first element of the list `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 or 1 based on its initial value if `q` equals 2.**
