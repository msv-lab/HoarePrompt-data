Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the same integer as in the initial state; `l` is the same list of integers as in the initial state; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking; `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to `q == i + 1` at any point.**
