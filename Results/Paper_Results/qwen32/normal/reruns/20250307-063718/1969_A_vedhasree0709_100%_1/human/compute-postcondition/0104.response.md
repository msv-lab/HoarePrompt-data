Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that the value at `p[i-1]` points back to `i`. If such an index exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.**
