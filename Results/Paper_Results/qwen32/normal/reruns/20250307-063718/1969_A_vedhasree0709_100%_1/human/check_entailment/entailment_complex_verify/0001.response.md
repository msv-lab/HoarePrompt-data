Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
Monocarp needs to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends attend. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations for `i` to attend. The goal is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through the list of best friends and checks for mutual best friend pairs. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.

### Key Points to Check
1. **Correctness of Pair Detection**: The program checks if `l[i]` (best friend of `i`) and `l[l[i] - 1]` (best friend of the best friend of `i`) are each other. This is correct for detecting mutual best friend pairs.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program needs to correctly handle cases where no mutual best friend pairs exist.
3. **Minimum Invitations**: The program assumes that if no mutual best friend pairs are found, 3 invitations are necessary. This assumption needs to be validated.

### Validation
1. **Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - The program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs. If `l[i] = j` and `l[j-1] = i+1`, then `i` and `j` are mutual best friends, and inviting both ensures their attendance.

2. **No Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - The program outputs `3` if no mutual best friend pairs are found. This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. There are no mutual best friend pairs, but inviting friends `1`, `2`, and `3` ensures that friends `1` and `2` attend because `1` and `2` have their best friends invited. However, it is possible to achieve the same with fewer invitations. For instance, inviting friends `1` and `3` ensures that friends `1` and `3` attend because `1` and `3` have their best friends invited.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
- There are no mutual best friend pairs.
- The program will output `3`.
- However, inviting friends `1` and `3` ensures that friends `1` and `3` attend, which means the correct answer should be `2`.

### Conclusion
The program incorrectly handles cases where no mutual best friend pairs are found by always outputting `3`. This is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
