Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is the first element of the list `l`, `q` is the first element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
