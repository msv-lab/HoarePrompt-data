The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is 1, the loop can execute one more time if `n` is at least 2 (because `i` would then be less than or equal to `n - 1`).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
