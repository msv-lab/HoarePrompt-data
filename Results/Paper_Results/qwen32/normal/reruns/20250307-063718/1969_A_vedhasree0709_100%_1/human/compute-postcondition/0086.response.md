The value of `j` is explicitly set to 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`, and `j` is 1.**
