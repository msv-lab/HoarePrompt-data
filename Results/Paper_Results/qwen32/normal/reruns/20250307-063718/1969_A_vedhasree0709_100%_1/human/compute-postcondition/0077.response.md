Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `p` is assigned the value of `l[0]`.
- `q` is assigned the value of `l[l[0] - 1]`.
- `q` is also said to equal `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, `q`).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
