To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the loop condition:

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while i <= n - 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the condition `i <= n - 1` is true. Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `l` is the new list of integers from the input (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0 (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the condition `0 <= n - 1` must hold true. This means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
