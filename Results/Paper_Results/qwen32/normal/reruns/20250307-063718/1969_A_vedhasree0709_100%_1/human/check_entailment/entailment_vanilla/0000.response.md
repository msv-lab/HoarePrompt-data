Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
Monocarp wants to throw a party and needs at least 2 friends to attend. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations for friend `i` to attend the party. The task is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates over the list of best friends and checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that inviting these two friends will ensure at least two friends attend the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, suggesting that inviting three friends is necessary.

### Key Points to Check
1. **Correctness of Pair Detection**: The program checks if `l[i]` (best friend of `i`) and `l[l[i] - 1]` (best friend of the best friend of `i`) are each other. This is correct for detecting mutual best friend pairs.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program needs to correctly handle cases where no mutual best friend pairs exist.
3. **Minimum Invitations**: The program assumes that if no mutual best friend pairs are found, 3 invitations are necessary. This assumption needs to be validated.

### Validation
1. **Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - If there exists a pair `(i, p_i)` such that `l[i] = p_i + 1` and `l[p_i] = i + 1`, then inviting these two friends ensures their attendance.
   - The program correctly identifies such pairs and outputs 2.

2. **No Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - If no such pairs exist, the program outputs 3.
   - This is based on the assumption that inviting three friends will ensure at least two friends attend. This assumption is valid because:
     - If there are no mutual pairs, the best strategy is to invite friends in a way that maximizes the number of friends who have their best friends invited. In the worst case, inviting three friends can ensure that at least two of them have their best friends invited.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and handles the case where no such pairs exist by outputting 3, which is a valid strategy to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
