The code snippet increments the variable `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
