Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `p` is the third element of the list `l`, `q` is the second element of the list `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
