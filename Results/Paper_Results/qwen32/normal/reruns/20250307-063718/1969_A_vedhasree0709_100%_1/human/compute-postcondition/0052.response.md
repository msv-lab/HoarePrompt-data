The code snippet sets `j` to 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `p` is the second element of the list `l`, `q` is the first element of the list `l`, `j` is 1**.
