Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `j` remains 0.**

Explanation: The value of `q` is reassigned to `l[p - 1]`, but since the condition for `j` to be set to 1 and the loop or if statement to be broken out of is not met (unless it was already met before this line), `j` remains 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
