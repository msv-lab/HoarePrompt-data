The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables in the given initial state. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
