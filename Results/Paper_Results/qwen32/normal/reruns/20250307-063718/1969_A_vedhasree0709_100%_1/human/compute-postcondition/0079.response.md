The `break` statement will terminate the loop or block it is inside, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, and `q` equals `i + 1`.**
