The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. Since `i` is 0, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (so that `n - 1` is at least 0, and thus `i <= n - 1` holds true).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
