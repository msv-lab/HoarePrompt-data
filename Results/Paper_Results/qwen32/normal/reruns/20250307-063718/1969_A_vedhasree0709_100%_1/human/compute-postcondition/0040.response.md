The variable `p` is assigned the value of the element at index `i` of the list `l`. Given that `i` is 0, `p` will be the first element of the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `l`.**
