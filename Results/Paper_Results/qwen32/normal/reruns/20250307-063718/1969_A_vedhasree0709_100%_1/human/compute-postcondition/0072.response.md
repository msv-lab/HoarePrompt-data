The code snippet `j = 0` sets the variable `j` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**.
