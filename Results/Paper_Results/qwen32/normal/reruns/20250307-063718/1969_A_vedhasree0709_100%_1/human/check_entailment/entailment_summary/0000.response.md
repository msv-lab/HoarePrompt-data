### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i's best friend is i (i.e., p[p_i - 1] = i + 1). If such a pair exists, the program outputs 2, implying that inviting these two friends will ensure they both come to the party. If no such pair is found, the program outputs 3, which is based on the assumption that at least 3 invitations are needed in such cases.

However, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it does not account for cases where more than one pair of friends can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend, and it incorrectly assumes that 3 invitations are always sufficient if no such pair exists. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
Here, no pair of friends directly point to each other, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 would result in friends 1 and 2 attending the party. The program would incorrectly output 3 instead of considering if fewer invitations could suffice.

The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations should involve checking all possible pairs and possibly more complex combinations to ensure the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all scenarios and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
