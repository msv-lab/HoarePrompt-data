To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. 

Here, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value is `t`, which is described as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`.

Given this information, the only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `t`. The value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The current state already satisfies this condition (`1 <= t <= 5000`), so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly interpreted as the number of iterations.

Since the loop head only involves `t` and it is already within the valid range, no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
