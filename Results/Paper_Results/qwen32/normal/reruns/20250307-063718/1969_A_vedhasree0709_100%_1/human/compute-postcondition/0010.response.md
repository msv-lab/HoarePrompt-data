The code snippet `j = 1` updates the value of the variable `j` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; and `q` equals `i + 1`.**
