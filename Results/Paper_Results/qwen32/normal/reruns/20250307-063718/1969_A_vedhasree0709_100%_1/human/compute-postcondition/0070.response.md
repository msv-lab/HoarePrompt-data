The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which the loop breaks, `j` is 0 as `q == i + 1` was never met during the loop.**
