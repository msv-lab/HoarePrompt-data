Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `p` is `l[3]`, `q` is `l[l[3] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `j`. `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is still at least 4, `l` remains the list of integers from the input, `i` remains 3, `p` remains `l[3]`, and `q` remains `l[l[3] - 1]`. The value of `j` is now 1.
