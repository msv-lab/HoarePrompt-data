To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop across all `t` test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: We start with `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each test case, the loop checks each element in the list `l` to see if there exists an index `i` such that `l[p[i-1] - 1] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we know that in each of those iterations, the loop completed all iterations without finding an index `i` such that `l[p[i-1] - 1] == i`, so `j` remained `0` and `i` reached `n`.

After all `t` iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:
- `t` will be `0` because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` and `l` will be the values from the last test case processed.
- `i` will be `n` if the last test case did not break the loop, otherwise it will be the value at which the loop broke.
- `j` will be `0` if the last test case did not break the loop, otherwise it will be `1`.

However, since the problem asks for the state after all executions, and we are not given any specific information about the last test case breaking the loop, we assume the loop completed all iterations in the last test case as well, which is consistent with the previous iterations.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` will be `0` because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` and `l` will be the values from the last test case processed.
- `i` will be `n` because the loop completed all iterations in the last test case.
- `j` will be `0` because the loop did not break in the last test case.

Output State: **t is 0; n and l are the values from the last test case; i is n; j is 0.**

In natural language: After all test cases have been processed, the variable `t` will be `0` indicating no more test cases remain. The variables `n` and `l` will hold the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop completed all iterations without breaking in the last test case, and `j` will be `0` indicating that the loop did not find any index `i` such that `l[p[i-1] - 1] == i` in the last test case.
