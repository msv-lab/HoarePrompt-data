Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which the loop breaks, `j` is 0 as `q == i + 1` was never met during the loop.**
