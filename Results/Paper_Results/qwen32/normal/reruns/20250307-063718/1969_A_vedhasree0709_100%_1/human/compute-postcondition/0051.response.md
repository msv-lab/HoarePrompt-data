The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or the state described in the initial conditions. The statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Let's break it down:
- The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- The variable `n` is at least 2.
- The variable `l` is a list of integers.
- The variable `i` is set to 1.
- The variable `p` is the second element of the list `l`.
- The variable `q` is the first element of the list `l`.
- The variable `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals 2.

However, none of these variables or their values are used in the `print(2)` statement. The statement is hardcoded to print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
