The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `p` is the first element of the list `l`, `q` is the first element of the list `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `p` is the first element of the list `l`, `q` is the first element of the list `l`, `j` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals 2**
