You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that the value at `p[i-1]` points back to `i`. If such an index exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
Monocarp wants to throw a party and needs at least 2 friends to attend. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations for friend `i` to attend the party. The task is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates over the list of best friends and checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that inviting these two friends will ensure at least two friends attend the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, suggesting that inviting three friends is necessary.

### Key Points to Check
1. **Correctness of Pair Detection**: The program checks if `l[i]` (best friend of `i`) and `l[l[i] - 1]` (best friend of the best friend of `i`) are each other. This is correct for detecting mutual best friend pairs.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program needs to correctly handle cases where no mutual best friend pairs exist.
3. **Minimum Invitations**: The program assumes that if no mutual best friend pairs are found, 3 invitations are necessary. This assumption needs to be validated.

### Validation
1. **Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - If there exists a pair `(i, p_i)` such that `l[i] = p_i + 1` and `l[p_i] = i + 1`, then inviting these two friends ensures their attendance.
   - The program correctly identifies such pairs and outputs 2.

2. **No Mutual Best Friend Pairs**:
   - If no such pairs exist, the program outputs 3.
   - This is based on the assumption that inviting three friends will ensure at least two friends attend. This assumption is valid because:
     - If there are no mutual pairs, the best strategy is to invite friends in a way that maximizes the number of friends who have their best friends invited. In the worst case, inviting three friends can ensure that at least two of them have their best friends invited.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and handles the case where no such pairs exist by outputting 3, which is a valid strategy to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

Correctness: **True**
