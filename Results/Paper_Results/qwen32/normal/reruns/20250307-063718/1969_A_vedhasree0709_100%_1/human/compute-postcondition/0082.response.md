The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n - 1` is at least 0. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to a value that is less than or equal to `n - 1` but greater than its current value (1) to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The smallest such value is 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
