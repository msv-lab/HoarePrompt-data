Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `j`. If `q` equals 3, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
