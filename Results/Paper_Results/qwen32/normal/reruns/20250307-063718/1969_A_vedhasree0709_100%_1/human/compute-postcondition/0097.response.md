Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 4, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `p` is `l[3]`, `q` is `l[l[3] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `j`.

The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The previous value of `i` is 3, so after the increment, `i` becomes 4. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 4, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 4, `p` is `l[3]`, `q` is `l[l[3] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `j`.**
