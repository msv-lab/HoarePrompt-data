The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `3`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will output the constant value `3`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `3`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the number `3`.

Output: **3**
