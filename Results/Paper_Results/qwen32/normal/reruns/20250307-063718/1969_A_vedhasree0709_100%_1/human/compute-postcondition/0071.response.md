The value of `i` is explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `j`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 as `q == i + 1` was never met during the loop.**
