Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `p` is the third element of the list `l`, `q` is the second element of the list `l`, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
