To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. In each iteration:
- `p` is assigned the value of `l[i]`.
- `q` is assigned the value of `l[p - 1]`.
- If `q` equals `i + 1`, the program prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop.
- If `q` does not equal `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by `1`.

Based on the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop has executed at least 3 times, which means `n` is at least 4.
- The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n`, unless the condition `q == i + 1` is met and the loop breaks.

The final state of the loop depends on whether the condition `q == i + 1` is met at any point during the iterations:
1. **If the condition `q == i + 1` is met at any point**:
   - The loop breaks immediately after printing `2` and setting `j` to `1`.
   - The final state will be: `i` will be the value at which the condition was met, `j` will be `1`, and the loop will not continue further.

2. **If the condition `q == i + 1` is never met**:
   - The loop will run until `i` equals `n`.
   - The final state will be: `i` will be `n`, `j` will remain `0` (since the condition was never met).

Given that we do not have specific values for `n` and the list `l`, we must consider both possibilities. However, since we are asked to determine the output state after all executions of the loop, we should consider the most general case where the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

Therefore, the final output state, assuming the loop completes all iterations without breaking, is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `i` is `n`, `j` is `0`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations without finding any `q` that equals `i + 1`, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will remain `0`. The other variables `t` and `l` remain unchanged.
