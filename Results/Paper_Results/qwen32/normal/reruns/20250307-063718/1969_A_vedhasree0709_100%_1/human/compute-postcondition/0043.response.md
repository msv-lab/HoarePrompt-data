Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the first element of the list `l`.
- `q` is the first element of the list `l`.
- `q` is equal to `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` directly prints the integer `2`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, or `q` are used in this print statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
