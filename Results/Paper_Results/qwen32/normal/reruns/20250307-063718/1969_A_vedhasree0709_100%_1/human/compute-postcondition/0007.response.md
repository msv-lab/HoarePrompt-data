The value of `q` is assigned the value of `l[p - 1]`. Given that `p` is initialized to `l[0]`, `q` will be the value at the index `l[0] - 1` of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`.**
