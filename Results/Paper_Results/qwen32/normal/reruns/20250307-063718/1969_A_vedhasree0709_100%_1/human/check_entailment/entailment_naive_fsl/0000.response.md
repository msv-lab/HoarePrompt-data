Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Specifically, the program assumes that if a pair of friends who are best friends with each other exist, then only 2 invitations are needed. However, this assumption is not always true.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation of the Expected Output:
In this case, Monocarp has 4 friends, and their best friends are as follows:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1

If Monocarp sends invitations to Friends 1, 2, and 3, then:
- Friend 1 and Friend 2 will come to the party because both received invitations.
- Friend 2 and Friend 3 will come to the party because both received invitations.
- Friend 3 and Friend 4 will come to the party because both received invitations.

However, if Monocarp sends invitations to only Friends 1 and 2, then:
- Friend 1 and Friend 2 will come to the party because both received invitations.
- Friend 2 and Friend 3 will come to the party because both received invitations.
- Friend 3 and Friend 4 will not come to the party because Friend 4 did not receive an invitation.

Thus, Monocarp needs to send at least 3 invitations to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The provided program will output `2` for this test case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
