Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
