The code snippet `s = i ^ check` attempts to assign the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check` to the variable `s`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means this code will raise a `NameError` because `i` is used without being initialized.

Since the code will not execute successfully due to the undefined variable `i`, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is greater than or equal to 1; `check` is 2147483647; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers with at least one element; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0**
