The only variable in the loop head is `times`, as `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will execute if `times` is at least 1. The variables `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `times` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `check` is 2147483647**
