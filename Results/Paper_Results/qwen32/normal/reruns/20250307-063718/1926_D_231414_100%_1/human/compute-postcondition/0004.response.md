The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The variables `t`, `times`, and `check` are not affected by this code snippet, and their values remain the same. The variable `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `check` is 2147483647; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
