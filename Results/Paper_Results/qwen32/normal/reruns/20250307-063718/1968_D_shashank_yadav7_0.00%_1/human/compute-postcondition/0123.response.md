The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially set to the value of `a[b]`. After executing the line `bp += a[b]`, `bp` will be the sum of its original value and `a[b]`. Therefore, the new value of `bp` will be `2 * a[b]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise `k` retains its original value decremented by 2; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sm` is `sp` if `k` was 0 and `sp` is greater than 0, otherwise `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `bm` is 0; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 0. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
