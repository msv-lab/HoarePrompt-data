The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that `a` will now hold the list of integers that were input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
