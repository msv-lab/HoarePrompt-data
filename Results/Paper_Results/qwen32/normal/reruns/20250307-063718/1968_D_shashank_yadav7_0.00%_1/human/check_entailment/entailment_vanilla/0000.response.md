Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and collect scores based on an array. They can either stay or move to the next position in the permutation each turn. The goal is to calculate the final scores after `k` turns and determine the winner.

### Key Points:
1. **Permutation and Array**: The permutation `p` and the array `a` are given.
2. **Starting Positions**: Both players start at given positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
3. **Turns**: The game lasts `k` turns.
4. **Score Calculation**: On each turn, the player's score increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`. They can choose to stay or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.
5. **Objective**: Determine who has the higher score after `k` turns.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
2. **Adjusting Indices**: The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing.
3. **Initial Scores**: The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values in `a` at their starting positions.
4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program iterates up to `k` times.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates their scores by adding the value at their new positions in `a`.
   - The logic for updating scores with `max` and additional multiplication by `k` seems incorrect. The scores should simply be accumulated by adding the values from `a` at the current positions.
5. **Comparison**: After `k` turns, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for updating scores with `max` and additional multiplication by `k` is incorrect. The scores should be accumulated by adding the values from `a` at the current positions.
- The program should break the loop after `k` turns, but the logic for updating scores inside the loop is flawed.

### Corrected Logic:
- Initialize scores to the values at the starting positions.
- For each turn, update the positions and add the corresponding values from `a` to the scores.
- After `k` turns, compare the scores and determine the winner.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the score updating logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
