The code snippet provided modifies the variable `bm` by adding the maximum value between the current `bm` and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Let's break down the calculation:
- The current value of `bm` remains unchanged unless the expression `a[b] * k + bp` is greater than the current `bm`.
- The new value of `bm` will be the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 2`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**.
