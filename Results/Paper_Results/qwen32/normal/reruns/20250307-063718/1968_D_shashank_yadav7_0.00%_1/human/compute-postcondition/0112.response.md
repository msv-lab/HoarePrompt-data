The code snippet `sm = a[s] * k` updates the value of `sm` to be the product of `a[s]` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer decremented by 1, `s` is an input integer decremented by 1, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
