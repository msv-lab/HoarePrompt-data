The code snippet `sm = a[s] * k` calculates the value of `sm` by multiplying the element at index `s` of the list `a` by `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `b` is decreased by 1.
- `s` is decreased by 1.
- `sp` is `a[s]`.
- `bp` is `a[b]`.
- `bm` is `bp * k`.

The variable `sm` is introduced and assigned the value `a[s] * k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is decreased by 1; `s` is decreased by 1; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**
