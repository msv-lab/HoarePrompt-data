The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `bm` is `2 * bm`
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`

After executing `k -= 1`, the value of `k` becomes `k - 2` (since `k` was initially `k - 1`).

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`**
