The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `2 * a[b]`. After the increment, `bp` becomes `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 1; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**.
