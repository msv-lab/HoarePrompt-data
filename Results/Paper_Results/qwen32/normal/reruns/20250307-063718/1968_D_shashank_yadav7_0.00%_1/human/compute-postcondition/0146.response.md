The `print('Bodya')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `a`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, or `bm`. The statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables affect the `print('Bodya')` statement directly.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print('Bodya')` statement is a direct print of the string `'Bodya'` and does not involve any variable substitution or evaluation.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
