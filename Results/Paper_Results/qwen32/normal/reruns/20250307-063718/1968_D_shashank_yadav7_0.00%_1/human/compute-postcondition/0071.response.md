The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 or remains `k - 1` and no break occurs, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**

In natural language: `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `k` either becomes 0 or remains `k - 1` without breaking out of the loop or if statement, `b` remains `p[b] - 1`, `s` remains `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, and `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`.
