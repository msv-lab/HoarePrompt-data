The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` is 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**
