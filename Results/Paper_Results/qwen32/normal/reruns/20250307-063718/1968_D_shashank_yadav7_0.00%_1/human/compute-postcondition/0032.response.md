The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is the loop's upper bound and does not change within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`**
