The code snippet modifies the value of `s`. Before the modification, `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`. After the execution of `s = p[s] - 1`, the new value of `s` will be `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**
