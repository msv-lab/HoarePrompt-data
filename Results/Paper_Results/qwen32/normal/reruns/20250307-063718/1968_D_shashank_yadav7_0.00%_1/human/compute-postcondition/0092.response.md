Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b] + a[b]`.**

In this output state, all variables except `bp` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `bp` has been updated to `bp + 2 * a[b] + a[b]`, effectively adding `a[b]` twice to its previous value.
