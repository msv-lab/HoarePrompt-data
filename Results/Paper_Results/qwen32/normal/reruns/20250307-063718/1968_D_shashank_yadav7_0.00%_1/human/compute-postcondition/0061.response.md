The code snippet `sm = a[s] * k` updates the value of `sm` to be the product of `a[s]` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1; `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
