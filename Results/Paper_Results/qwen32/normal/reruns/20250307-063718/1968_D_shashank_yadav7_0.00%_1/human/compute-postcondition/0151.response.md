The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are directly involved in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'` without referencing any of the variables `a`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, or `p`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of the variables, the output will be exactly the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
