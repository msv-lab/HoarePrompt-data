Postcondition: **`i` is `min(n, k) - 1`, `k` is `max(0, k - min(n, k))`, `b` is the value after `min(n, k)` iterations of `b = p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `min(n, k)` iterations of `s = p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the accumulated value after `min(n, k)` iterations, `sm` is the accumulated value after `min(n, k)` iterations, `sp` is the accumulated value of `a[s]` after `min(n, k)` iterations, `bp` is the accumulated value of `a[b]` after `min(n, k)` iterations, and `bm` is equal to `sm`**
