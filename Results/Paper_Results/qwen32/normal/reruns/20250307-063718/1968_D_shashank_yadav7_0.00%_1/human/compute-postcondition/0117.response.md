Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise `k` retains its original value decremented by 2; `b` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is an input integer decremented by 1; `sm` is 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `sm` retains its original value `a[s] * k`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is the value of `a[b]`; `bm` is 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `bm` retains its original value `a[b] * k`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 0. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
