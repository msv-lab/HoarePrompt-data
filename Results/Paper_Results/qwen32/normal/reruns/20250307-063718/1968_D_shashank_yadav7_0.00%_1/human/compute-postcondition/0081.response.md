The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Therefore, the value of `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is incremented by `a[s]` again, and `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.
