The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`. This string is not dependent on the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, or `bp`. The values of these variables are determined by the iterations and conditions specified, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement in any way.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `i` is calculated as `min(n, k) - 1`.
2. `k` is recalculated as `max(0, k - min(n, k))`.
3. `b` and `s` are iteratively updated `min(n, k)` times using the formula `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`.
4. `bm` and `sm` are accumulated values after `min(n, k)` iterations.
5. `sp` and `bp` are accumulated values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively after `min(n, k)` iterations.
6. `bm` is set to be equal to `sm`.

Despite these calculations and assignments, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Draw**
