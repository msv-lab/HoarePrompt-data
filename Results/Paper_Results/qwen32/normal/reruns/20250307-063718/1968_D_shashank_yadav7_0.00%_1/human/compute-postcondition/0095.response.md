The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of several variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`), their values, and the conditions under which they are calculated. However, none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('Bodya')
```
The output will simply be the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **Bodya**
