Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `b` and `s` are integers obtained from the input and have each been decreased by 2; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
