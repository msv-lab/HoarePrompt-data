Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0 (as per the if condition); `b` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is an input integer decremented by 1; `sm` is `a[s] * k` which simplifies to 0 since `k` is 0; `sp` is the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is the value of `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k` which simplifies to 0 since `k` is 0; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 0.**
