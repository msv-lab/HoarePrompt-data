The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 1; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**

In simpler terms, `sp` is now equal to its original value plus `a[s]` twice. All other variables retain their original values.
