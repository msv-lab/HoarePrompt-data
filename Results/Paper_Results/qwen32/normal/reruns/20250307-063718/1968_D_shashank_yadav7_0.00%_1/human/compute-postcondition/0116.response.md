Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0; `b` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is an input integer decremented by 1; `sm` is 0; `sp` is the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is the value of `a[b]`; `bm` is 0; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
