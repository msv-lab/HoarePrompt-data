The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `sp` will be the old value of `sp` plus `a[s]`.

Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `sp`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.**
