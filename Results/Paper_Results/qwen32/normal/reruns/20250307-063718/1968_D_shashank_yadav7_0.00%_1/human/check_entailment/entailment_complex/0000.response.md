### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to simulate the game between Bodya and Sasha for each test case. However, there are a few issues with the logic that the program uses to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` with `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which implies that it assumes both players will stay in their initial positions for all `k` turns and gain the value of `a[b]` or `a[s]` each turn. This is incorrect because the players can choose to move to `p[b]` or `p[s]` on each turn.
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to update `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score and the score obtained by moving to the next position. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for each player. The maximum score should be obtained by considering the best possible sequence of moves for each player, which is not what the current logic does.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but `k` is decremented inside the loop. This can lead to incorrect behavior if `k` is less than `n`. The loop should run `k` times, not `n` times.
   - The logic inside the loop also incorrectly updates the scores. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` does not make sense because it tries to add a maximum value to the current score, which is not the correct way to simulate the game. Instead, the scores should be updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position and then moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Initialization of Scores:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct. However, the scores `bm` and `sm` should be initialized to 0 and then updated by adding the values of `a` at the current positions in each turn.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
