The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Therefore, if `k` was initially 0, it will now be -1. If `k` was initially any other value, it will be that value minus 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**
