Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is the input integer; `k` is `max(0, input_k - n)`; `b` is the value after `n` updates according to `p`; `s` is the value after `n` updates according to `p`; `sm` is the accumulated maximum value as described; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the accumulated maximum value as described; `p` is a list of integers from the input. Additionally, `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bm` is either less than `sm` or equal to `sm`.**
