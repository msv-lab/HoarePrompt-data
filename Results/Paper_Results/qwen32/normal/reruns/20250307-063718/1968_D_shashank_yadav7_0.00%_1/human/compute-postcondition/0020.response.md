The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`.
- `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`.
- `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`.
- `bp` is `a[p[initial b] - 1]`.
- `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` is 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`.

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` changes to `sp + a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` is 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**.
