Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states and values, including `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.
