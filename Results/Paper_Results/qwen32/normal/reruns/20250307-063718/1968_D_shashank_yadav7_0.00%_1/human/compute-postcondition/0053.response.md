The code snippet provided assigns new values to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` based on the input. The initial values of these variables are overwritten by the values read from the input. The variables `i`, `t`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `b` is the third integer from the input; `s` is the fourth integer from the input; `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.**
