The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is `k_initial - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1] - 1`
- `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`
- `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

After executing the code snippet, `sp` becomes `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[p[initial s] - 1] + 3 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k_initial - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + 3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
