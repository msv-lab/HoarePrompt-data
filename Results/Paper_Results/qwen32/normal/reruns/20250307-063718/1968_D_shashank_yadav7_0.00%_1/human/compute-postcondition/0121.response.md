To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the given Python code snippet on the variables provided in the Initial State.

Given code snippet:
```
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

This line modifies the variable `sm` by adding the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp` to it.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the value of `k`:

1. **If `k` is 0:**
   - `sm` was initially set to 0.
   - `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `0 + sp` which is `sp`.
   - `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` becomes `max(0, sp)`, which is `sp` if `sp` is greater than 0, otherwise 0.
   - Since `sm` was 0, `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` results in `sm = sp` if `sp` is greater than 0, otherwise `sm` remains 0.

2. **If `k` is not 0:**
   - `sm` retains its original value.
   - `a[s] * k + sp` is computed.
   - `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is computed.
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Given these scenarios, the Output State can be described as follows:

- If `k` is 0:
  - `sm` becomes `sp` if `sp` is greater than 0; otherwise, `sm` remains 0.
- If `k` is not 0:
  - `sm` becomes the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise `k` retains its original value decremented by 2; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sm` is `sp` if `k` was 0 and `sp` is greater than 0, otherwise `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is the value of `a[b]`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `bm` is 0; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 0. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
