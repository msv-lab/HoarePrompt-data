To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This means we will add to `sm` the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. `sm` is initially calculated as `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`.
2. We are adding to `sm` the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

The new value of `sm` will be:
\[ \text{new\_sm} = \text{sm} + \max(\text{sm}, a[s] * k + sp) \]

Since we don't have specific values for `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, we can't simplify this further. However, we can express the new value of `sm` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k_initial - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

In natural language, the new value of `sm` is the original `sm` plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
