The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the variable `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Therefore, the new value of `bp` is the sum of its previous value and `a[b]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `bp`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`**.
