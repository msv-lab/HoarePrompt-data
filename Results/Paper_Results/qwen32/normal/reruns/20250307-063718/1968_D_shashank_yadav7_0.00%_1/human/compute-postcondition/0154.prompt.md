Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged and their initial conditions are still valid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0; i is the minimum of n and the number of times k was decremented before reaching 0; n is greater than 0; k is 0 if the loop ran until k reached 0, otherwise k is n - i; b is the final index after all iterations; s is the final index after all iterations; sp is the sum of the initial a[s] and all a[s] values encountered during the iterations; bp is the sum of the initial a[b] and all a[b] values encountered during the iterations; bm and sm are the cumulative maximum values calculated during the iterations; bm is greater than sm if the condition bm > sm is true, otherwise bm is less than or equal to sm.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`, `k` is `max(0, k - min(n, k))`, `b` is the value after `min(n, k)` iterations of `b = p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `min(n, k)` iterations of `s = p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the accumulated value after `min(n, k)` iterations, `sm` is the accumulated value after `min(n, k)` iterations, `sp` is the accumulated value of `a[s]` after `min(n, k)` iterations, `bp` is the accumulated value of `a[b]` after `min(n, k)` iterations, and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is the input integer; `k` is `max(0, input_k - n)`; `b` is the value after `n` updates according to `p`; `s` is the value after `n` updates according to `p`; `sm` is the accumulated maximum value as described; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the accumulated maximum value as described; `p` is a list of integers from the input. Additionally, `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bm` is either less than `sm` or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
