The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into four integer values, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial state of `t` and `i` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input.**
