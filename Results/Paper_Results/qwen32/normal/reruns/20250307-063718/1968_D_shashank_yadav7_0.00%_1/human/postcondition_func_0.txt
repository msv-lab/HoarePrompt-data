The function processes `t` test cases, each involving integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates scores for two entities, Bodya and Sasha, based on the values in `p` and `a`, and the integer `k`. It then prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.
