The given code snippet modifies the variable `sm` by adding the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` to it.

Let's break down the changes:
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This means `sm` will take the value of `sm` plus the larger value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `p`, `i`, `bm`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the operation, the output state can be described as follows:
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is `k - 1`.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp`.
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.
- `p` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 1; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.**
