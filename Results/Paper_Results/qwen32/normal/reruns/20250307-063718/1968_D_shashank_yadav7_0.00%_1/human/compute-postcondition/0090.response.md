Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm`. The new value of `sm` is the sum of its previous value and the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
