The given code snippet modifies the variable `sm` by adding to it the maximum value between the current `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. 

Let's break down the changes:
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This means that `sm` will either be doubled if `a[s] * k + sp` is greater than `sm`, or it will remain the same if `sm` is greater than `a[s] * k + sp`.

Other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 2`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables retain their initial values.
