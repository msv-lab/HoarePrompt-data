Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k_initial - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[b]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`**

Natural Language Description: The value of `bm` is updated to be the sum of its current value and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
