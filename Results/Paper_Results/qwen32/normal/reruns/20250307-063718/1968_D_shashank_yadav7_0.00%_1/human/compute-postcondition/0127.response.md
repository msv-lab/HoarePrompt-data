Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 1. If `k` was 0, `sm` is `sp` if `sp` is greater than 0, otherwise `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * k + sp`, and `bm` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * k + sp`, and `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.**
