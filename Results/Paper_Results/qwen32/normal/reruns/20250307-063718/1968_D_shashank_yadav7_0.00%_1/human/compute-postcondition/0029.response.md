Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`
- `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`
- `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`
- `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`

The code snippet is:
```
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

This line modifies the value of `sm` by adding the maximum of the current value of `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.

The new value of `sm` will be:
- `sm = sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

Since `sm` is initially `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`, the new value of `sm` will be:
- `sm = a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`**.
