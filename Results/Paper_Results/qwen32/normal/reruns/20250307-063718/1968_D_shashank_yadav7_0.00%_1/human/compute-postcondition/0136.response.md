Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 2`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
