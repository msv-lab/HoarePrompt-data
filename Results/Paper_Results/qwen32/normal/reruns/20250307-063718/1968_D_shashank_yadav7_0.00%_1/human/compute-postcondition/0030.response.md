The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `sp` is the previous value of `sp` plus `a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains `k - 1`.
- `b` remains `p[p[initial b] - 1] - 1`.
- `s` remains `p[p[initial s] - 1] - 1`.
- `sp` is now `a[p[initial s] - 1] + 2 * a[s]`.
- `bp` remains `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`.
- `bm` remains `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`.
- `sm` remains `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1) + max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`.
