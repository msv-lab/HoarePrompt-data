Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
