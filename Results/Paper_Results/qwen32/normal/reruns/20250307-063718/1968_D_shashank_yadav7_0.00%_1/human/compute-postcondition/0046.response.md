Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0; i is the minimum of n and the number of times k was decremented before reaching 0; n is greater than 0; k is 0 if the loop ran until k reached 0, otherwise k is n - i; b is the final index after all iterations; s is the final index after all iterations; sp is the sum of the initial a[s] and all a[s] values encountered during the iterations; bp is the sum of the initial a[b] and all a[b] values encountered during the iterations; bm is the cumulative maximum values calculated during the iterations; sm is the cumulative maximum values calculated during the iterations; bm is less than sm**
