### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Permutation and Array**: We have a permutation `p` and an array `a` of length `n`.
2. **Game Duration**: The game lasts for `k` turns.
3. **Starting Positions**: Bodya starts at `P_B` and Sasha starts at `P_S`.
4. **Scoring and Movement**:
   - Each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in `a`.
   - Then, the player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by their current position in `p`.
5. **Objective**: Determine the winner after `k` turns based on the scores.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to the value at their starting positions in `a`.
   - The program attempts to calculate the scores for `k` turns by iterating and updating positions based on `p`.

3. **Movement and Scoring Logic**:
   - The program iterates up to `k` times, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on `p` and adding the corresponding values from `a` to their scores.
   - However, there are issues in the logic:
     - The loop iterates `n` times instead of `k` times, which is incorrect.
     - The updates to `bm` and `sm` are incorrect. The program incorrectly uses `max` inappropriately and does not correctly account for the score accumulation over `k` turns.
     - The variables `sp` and `bp` are not updated correctly, leading to incorrect score calculations.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the winner based on the scores calculated, but due to the incorrect logic, the results may not be accurate.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times.
- The score updates should correctly accumulate the values from `a` over `k` turns without using `max` incorrectly.
- The positions should be updated correctly based on `p` for each turn.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic for score calculation and position updates, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
