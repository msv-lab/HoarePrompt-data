Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and if `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` remains `k - 1` and no break occurs. `b` is `p[b] - 1`. `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
