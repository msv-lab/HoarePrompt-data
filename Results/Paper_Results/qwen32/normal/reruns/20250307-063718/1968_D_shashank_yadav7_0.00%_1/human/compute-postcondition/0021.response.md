The code snippet provided is `bp += a[b]`, which means `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `bp` is `a[p[initial b] - 1]`
- `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`

After the execution of `bp += a[b]`, the new value of `bp` will be:

`bp = a[p[initial b] - 1] + a[p[initial b] - 1] = 2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` is 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**.
