Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged and their initial conditions are still valid.**

In simpler terms: `t` is now the integer value provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
