The code snippet provided is `bp += a[b]`. This means the value of `bp` is being incremented by the value of `a[b]`.

Given the Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `bm` is `2 * bm`
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`
- `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

After the code `bp += a[b]` is executed, `bp` is incremented by `a[b]` again. Therefore, the new value of `bp` will be `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, which can be simplified to `bp + 2 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`**.
