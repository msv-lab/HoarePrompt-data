To determine the new value of `sm` after the code snippet is executed, we need to evaluate the expression `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Given:
- `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k`
- `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`
- `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`
- `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`

Let's break this down step by step:

1. If `k` was initially 1, `k` is now 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 1`.
2. `sm` is initially `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k`.
3. `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k + a[p[initial s] - 1]` if `k` is not 0, otherwise it simplifies to `a[p[initial s] - 1] * 0 + a[p[initial s] - 1]` which is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`.
4. `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` will be `max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * k, a[p[initial s] - 1] * k + a[p[initial s] - 1])` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `max(0, a[p[initial s] - 1])` which is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`.

Since `sm` is initially `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k`, we need to consider two cases:
- If `k` is 0, `sm` is 0 and `max(0, a[p[initial s] - 1])` is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`. Therefore, `sm` becomes `a[p[initial s] - 1]`.
- If `k` is not 0, `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k` and `max(a[p[initial s] - 1] * k, a[p[initial s] - 1] * k + a[p[initial s] - 1])` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k + a[p[initial s] - 1]`. Therefore, `sm` becomes `a[p[initial s] - 1] * k + a[p[initial s] - 1]`.

Combining both cases, `sm` becomes `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`.

Other variables like `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if it was initially 1, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `b` is `p[initial b] - 1`; `s` is `p[initial s] - 1`; `sp` is `a[p[initial s] - 1]`; `bp` is `a[p[initial b] - 1]`; `bm` is `max(bm, bp)` if `k` is 0, otherwise `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[p[initial s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**.
