Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`. The value of `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.**

In natural language: The value of `sm` is updated to be `sm` plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables retain their previous values.
