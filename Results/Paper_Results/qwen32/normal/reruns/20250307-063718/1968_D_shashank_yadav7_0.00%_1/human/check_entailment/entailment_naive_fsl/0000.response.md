Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that can lead to incorrect results in some cases:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines do not correctly update the scores. The `max` function here does not make sense in this context. The scores should simply be incremented by the values at the current positions.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition and the decrement of `k` are not correctly handling the number of turns. The loop should run `k` times, and the decrement should be done correctly inside the loop.

3. **Index Update:**
   - The update of indices `b` and `s` is incorrect. The current position should be updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively, but this is already correctly done. However, the score calculation logic is flawed.

4. **Initialization of Scores:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set correctly, but the scores `bm` and `sm` are incorrectly initialized with `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` which is not the correct way to initialize the scores.

### Corrected Approach:

The corrected version of the program should look something like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of Correctness:

- **Initialization:** The scores `bp` and `sp` are initialized with the values at the starting positions `a[b]` and `a[s]`.
- **Loop:** The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, the scores are updated by adding the value at the current position, and then the positions are updated to the next positions in the permutation.
- **Comparison:** After the loop, the scores are compared, and the winner is determined accordingly.

Since the original program does not correctly handle the score updates and the loop conditions, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
