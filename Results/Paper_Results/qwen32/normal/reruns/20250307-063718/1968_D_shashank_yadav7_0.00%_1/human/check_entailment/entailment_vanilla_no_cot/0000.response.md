Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The logic for `bm` and `sm` (Bodya's and Sasha's total scores) is flawed. Specifically, the `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` lines are incorrect because they do not correctly accumulate the scores. The `max` function is not needed here, and the scores should simply be accumulated by adding the value of the current position's score `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

2. **Off-by-One Error:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but `k` turns should be considered. The loop should run `k` times, not `n` times.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Moves:**
   - The program is supposed to simulate the game for `k` turns, but it incorrectly handles the moves and score accumulation. The logic for moving to the next position (`b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`) is correct, but the score accumulation is incorrect.

4. **Improvement in Score Calculation:**
   - The scores should be calculated by adding the value of the current position's score to the total score for each turn. The `max` function does not fit the context of the problem, and the scores should be simply accumulated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # k-1 because we already counted the first turn
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The scores are correctly accumulated by adding the value of the current position's score for each turn.
- The loop runs `k - 1` times because the first turn's score is already counted before the loop.
- The logic for moving to the next position remains the same and is correct.
