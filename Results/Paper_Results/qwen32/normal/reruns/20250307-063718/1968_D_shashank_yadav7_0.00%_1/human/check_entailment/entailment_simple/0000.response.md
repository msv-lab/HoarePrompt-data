### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game by simulating the moves of Bodya and Sasha for `k` turns. However, there are several issues with the logic and the implementation:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Scores:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are correctly initialized to `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - However, the initial scores `bm` and `sm` are incorrectly initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This implies that the scores are being multiplied by the number of turns `k` from the start, which is not the correct approach. The scores should be accumulated over the turns, not pre-multiplied by `k`.

2. **Updating Scores:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, but it should only iterate `k` times because the game lasts exactly `k` turns.
   - Inside the loop, the scores `bm` and `sm` are updated incorrectly. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` does not make sense because it compares the current score `bm` with a future potential score `a[b] * k + bp`, which is not the correct way to accumulate scores. The same issue applies to `sm`.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would be to initialize `bm` and `sm` to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, then iterate `k` times, updating the scores by adding the value of `a` at the current position of Bodya and Sasha.
   - The positions of Bodya and Sasha should be updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively after each turn.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop should run exactly `k` times, not `n` times. The loop condition should be `for i in range(k):`.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # k - 1 because we already counted the initial positions
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# State: A series of print statements ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") for each of the `t` iterations.
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has significant logical errors in the way it calculates and updates scores. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
