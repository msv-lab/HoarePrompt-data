Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
