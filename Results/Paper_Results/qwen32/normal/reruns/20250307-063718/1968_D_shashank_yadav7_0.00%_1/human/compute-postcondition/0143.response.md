The code snippet provided is `bp += a[b]`, which means that the value of `bp` is updated by adding the value of `a[b]` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is `k - 2`.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]` plus the value of `a[s]`.
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`.
- `p` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

After executing the code `bp += a[b]`, the value of `bp` changes. The new value of `bp` will be `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 2`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is the value of `a[s]` plus the original value of `sp` plus the value of `a[s]` plus the value of `a[s]`; `bp` is `4 * a[b]`; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**.
