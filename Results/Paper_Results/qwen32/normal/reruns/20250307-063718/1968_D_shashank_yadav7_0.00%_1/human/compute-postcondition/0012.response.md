Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k`, `b`, `s` are integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is decreased by 1; `s` is decreased by 1; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`; `k` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previously described states and values.
