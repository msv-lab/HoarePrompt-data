Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
