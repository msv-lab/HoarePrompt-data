Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is decreased by 1, `s` is decreased by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`.**

In natural language: The value of `bp` is now assigned the value of `a[b]`. All other variables retain their previously described values and states.
