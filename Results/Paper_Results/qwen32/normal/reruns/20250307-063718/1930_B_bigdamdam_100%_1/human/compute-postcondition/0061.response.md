The code snippet provided is `ind -= 2`, which means the value of `ind` will be decreased by 2.

Initial State: 
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2`
- `ind` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `x + 3`

Since `ind` is initially `n - 2`, after `ind -= 2`, the new value of `ind` will be `(n - 2) - 2` or `n - 4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2`, `ind` is `n - 4`, `i` is `x + 3`.**
