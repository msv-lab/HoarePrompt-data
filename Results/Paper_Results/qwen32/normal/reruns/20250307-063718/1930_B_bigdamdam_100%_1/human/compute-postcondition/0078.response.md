To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` according to specific rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop constructs the permutation `p` for each test case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - `ind` is set to `n`.

2. **Filling Even Indices**:
   - The loop iterates over even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` and assigns values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 each time.
   - After this loop, `ind` is set to `1 + n % 2`.

3. **Filling Odd Indices**:
   - The loop iterates over odd indices `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1` and assigns values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2 each time.
   - After this loop, the list `p` is completely filled.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed.

The loop runs for `t` test cases, and for each test case, a new permutation `p` is constructed and printed.

### Output State after All Iterations

- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.
- **`p`**: For each test case, `p` is a permutation of length `n` constructed as follows:
  - Elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`.
  - Elements at odd indices `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1` are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)` if `n` is odd, or `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is even.
- **`ind`**: This variable is used during the construction of `p` and does not retain a specific value after the loop completes a test case. It is reset for each new test case.
- **`i`**: This loop variable is used in the inner loops to index into the list `p` and does not retain a specific value after the loop completes a test case. It is reset for each new iteration of the inner loops.

### Final Output State in the Required Format

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, a permutation `p` of length `n` is constructed and printed. The elements at even indices of `p` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, and the elements at odd indices are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)` if `n` is odd, or `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is even. The variables `ind` and `i` are loop variables and do not retain specific values after the loop completes each test case.**
