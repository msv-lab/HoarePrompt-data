The code snippet `ind -= 2` decrements the value of `ind` by 2. Given the initial state, `ind` is initially equal to `n`. After the decrement, `ind` will be `n - 2`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n`; `ind` is `n - 2`**.
