You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input arguments. Instead, it should read from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, a permutation `p` of length `n` is constructed and printed. The elements at even indices of `p` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, and the elements at odd indices are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)` if `n` is odd, or `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is even. The variables `ind` and `i` are loop variables and do not retain specific values after the loop completes each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a permutation `p` of length `n`. The permutation `p` is such that elements at even indices are filled in descending order starting from `n`, and elements at odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from `1 + n % 2`. The function then prints the constructed permutation for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a permutation by placing larger numbers at even indices and smaller numbers at odd indices, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem description:

#### Input:
```
2
4
3
```

#### Expected Output:
For \( n = 4 \), one valid permutation is \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \).
For \( n = 3 \), one valid permutation is \( [1, 2, 3] \).

#### Program Output:
The program generates:
```
4 1 2 3
1 2 3
```

Let's verify if this output meets the problem requirements.

### Verification:
1. **For \( n = 4 \):**
   - Permutation: \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \)
   - Check pairs:
     - \( 4 \) and \( 1 \) do not satisfy the condition (since \( 4 \) does not divide \( 1 \)).
     - \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) do not satisfy the condition (since \( 1 \) divides \( 2 \), but \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \)).
     - \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) do not satisfy the condition (since \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \)).
     - No other pairs need to be checked since the pattern ensures no two consecutive elements can satisfy the division condition with any other pair.

2. **For \( n = 3 \):**
   - Permutation: \( [1, 2, 3] \)
   - Check pairs:
     - \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) do not satisfy the condition (since \( 1 \) divides \( 2 \), but \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \)).
     - \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) do not satisfy the condition (since \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \)).
     - No other pairs need to be checked.

### General Case Analysis:
The program's approach ensures that no two consecutive elements can satisfy the division condition with any other pair by alternating between larger and smaller numbers. This pattern avoids the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Edge Cases:
- **Small \( n \):** The program handles \( n = 3 \) correctly.
- **Larger \( n \):** The pattern ensures that larger numbers are placed at even indices and smaller numbers at odd indices, maintaining the required property.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly generate permutations for the given problem description. No counterexamples were found where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly generates permutations for all tested cases and appears to handle the problem requirements as described.
