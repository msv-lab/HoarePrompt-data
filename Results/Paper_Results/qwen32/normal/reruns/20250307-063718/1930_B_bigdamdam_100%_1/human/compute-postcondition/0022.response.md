The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `ind` is `5 + n % 2` and `i` is `7 + n % 2`.

Therefore, the element at index `7 + n % 2` in the list `p` is updated to `5 + n % 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[5 + n % 2] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[7 + n % 2] = 5 + n % 2`, and `p[i] = 1 + n % 2` where `i` is an unspecified index, `ind` is `5 + n % 2`, `i` is `7 + n % 2`**.
