The code snippet `p[i] = ind` modifies the list `p` by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `ind`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` must be at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`
- `ind` is `n`

After executing the code:
- The value of `p[0]` (since `i` is 0) is set to `ind`, which is `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and the other elements of `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `n` and the rest are `0`, `ind` is `n`.**
