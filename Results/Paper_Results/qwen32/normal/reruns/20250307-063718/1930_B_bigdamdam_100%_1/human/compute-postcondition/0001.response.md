The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts the first part to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` is the first integer from the input line.**
