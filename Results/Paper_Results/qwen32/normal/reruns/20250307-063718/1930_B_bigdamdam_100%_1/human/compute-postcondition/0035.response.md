The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Given that the initial value of `ind` is `n-2`, after the code execution, `ind` becomes `n-4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `n`, the second element is 0, the third element is `n-2`, and the rest are 0, `ind` is `n-4`.**
