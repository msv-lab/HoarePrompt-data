The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`) remain unchanged. Since `n % 2` will either be `0` or `1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, `ind` will be `1` if `n` is even and `2` if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` is the first integer from the input line; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., and `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.**
