Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`; `ind` is `n - 4`; `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so if `ind` was initially `n - 2`, it is now `n - 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.
