Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function receives no direct input arguments. Instead, it should read from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is the first integer from the input line, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[1] = 1 + n % 2`, `p[3] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[5] = 5 + n % 2`, ..., `p[n-1] = n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `p[n-2] = n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even, and `ind` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` remains the same, `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, and elements at odd indices `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1` are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, and `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` remains the same; `p` is a list of `n` elements where even indices are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n - 2*floor(n/2) + 2`, and odd indices are `1, 3, 5, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) + 1` if `n` is even or `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) + 2` if `n` is odd; `ind` is `1 + 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is even, and `2 + 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is odd; `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
