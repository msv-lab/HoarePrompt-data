To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, we need to understand the structure of the list `p` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Explanation:
1. **t**: A positive integer ranging from 1 to 1000. However, `t` is not directly used in the construction of the list `p` or in the print statement.
2. **n**: The number of elements in the list `p`.
3. **p**: A list of `n` elements constructed as follows:
   - Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., `floor(n/2)*2`) are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`.
   - Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., `n-1`) are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
4. **ind**: This variable is calculated as `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`, but it is not used in the print statement.

### Construction of List `p`:
- **Even Indices**: These are filled in descending order starting from `n` and decrementing by 2 until we reach `n-2*floor(n/2)`.
- **Odd Indices**: These are filled in ascending order starting from `1 + n % 2` and incrementing by 2 until we reach `1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

### Example Construction:
Let's construct `p` for a few values of `n` to understand the pattern.

#### Case 1: n = 5
- Even indices: `5, 3, 1`
- Odd indices: `2, 4`
- List `p`: `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`

#### Case 2: n = 6
- Even indices: `6, 4, 2`
- Odd indices: `1, 3, 5`
- List `p`: `[6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`

### General Construction:
For a given `n`, the list `p` will be constructed as follows:
- **Even indices**: `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`
- **Odd indices**: `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`

### Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **p (where p is a list constructed such that elements at even indices are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2) and elements at odd indices are 1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2))**

This description captures the precise structure of the list `p` based on the given initial state.
