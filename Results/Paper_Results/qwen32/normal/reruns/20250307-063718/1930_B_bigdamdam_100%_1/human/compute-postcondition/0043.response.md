Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, the element at index `i` is `1 + n % 2`, and all other elements are `0`, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`**

In natural language: The value of `ind` has been incremented by 2, so if `ind` was initially `1 + n % 2`, it is now `3 + n % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
