Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` remains the same; `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)` and all other elements are `0`; `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.**

In natural language: The variable `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
