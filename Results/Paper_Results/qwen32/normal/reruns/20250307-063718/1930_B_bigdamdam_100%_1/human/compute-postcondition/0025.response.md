To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the structure and values of the list `p` based on the given initial state.

1. **List `p` Construction**:
   - The list `p` is defined with `n` elements.
   - The first element `p[0]` is always `n`.
   - The elements at even indices (2, 4, 6, ...) are defined as `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, ..., until the sequence reaches a non-positive value.
   - The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are defined as `1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ..., up to `n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even.

2. **Pattern Description**:
   - For even `n`, the pattern of `p` is:
     - `p[0] = n`
     - `p[1] = 1 + n % 2` (which is 1 if `n` is even)
     - `p[2] = n - 2`
     - `p[3] = 3 + n % 2` (which is 3 if `n` is even)
     - `p[4] = n - 4`
     - `p[5] = 5 + n % 2` (which is 5 if `n` is even)
     - This pattern continues until the end of the list.
   - For odd `n`, the pattern of `p` is:
     - `p[0] = n`
     - `p[1] = 1 + n % 2` (which is 2 if `n` is odd)
     - `p[2] = n - 2`
     - `p[3] = 3 + n % 2` (which is 4 if `n` is odd)
     - `p[4] = n - 4`
     - `p[5] = 5 + n % 2` (which is 6 if `n` is odd)
     - This pattern continues until the end of the list.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - If `n = 5` (odd), the list `p` will be:
     - `p[0] = 5`
     - `p[1] = 2`
     - `p[2] = 3`
     - `p[3] = 4`
     - `p[4] = 1`
   - If `n = 6` (even), the list `p` will be:
     - `p[0] = 6`
     - `p[1] = 1`
     - `p[2] = 4`
     - `p[3] = 3`
     - `p[4] = 2`
     - `p[5] = 5`

4. **General Output**:
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Given the general pattern and the construction rules, the printed output will be the elements of `p` as defined by the rules above.

Output: **n, 1 + n % 2, n - 2, 3 + n % 2, n - 4, 5 + n % 2, ..., (n - 1 + n % 2 or n - 2 + n % 2) (where n is the first integer from the input line and the pattern continues as described)**
