Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `n`, the second element is 0, the third element is `n-2`, the fourth element is `n-4`, and the rest are 0, `ind` is `n-6`.**

In natural language: The value of `ind` has been decreased by 2, so if it was initially `n-4`, it is now `n-6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
