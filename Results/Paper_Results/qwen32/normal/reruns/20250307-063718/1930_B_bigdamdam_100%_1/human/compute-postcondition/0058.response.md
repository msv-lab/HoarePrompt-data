The code snippet `ind -= 2` decrements the value of `ind` by 2. Given the initial state, `ind` is initially `n`. After decrementing by 2, `ind` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n`, `ind` is `n - 2`, `i` is `x + 1`.**
