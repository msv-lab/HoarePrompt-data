The code snippet `ind = n` updates the value of `ind` to be equal to the value of `n`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` is the first integer from the input line; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`; `ind` is `n`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
