To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The given for loop is:
```python
for i in range(0, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`
- `ind` is `n - 4`
- `i` is `n - 2`

The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n` (because `i` is incremented by 2). When `i` equals `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next valid value in the sequence, which is `n - 2 - 2 = n - 4`.

However, based on the loop's behavior, if `i` is `n - 2`, the next value should be `n`, and the loop should terminate. Therefore, there is no valid next state for `i` that would allow the loop to execute again under the given conditions.

Given the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), and considering the loop's termination condition, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the termination state) is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`; `ind` is `n - 4`; `i` is `n`**

But since the loop terminates when `i` is `n`, the loop does not execute again. The state provided reflects the termination state.
