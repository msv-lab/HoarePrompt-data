Functionality: **The function reads from standard input where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` for each test case. The function then processes each test case and returns the result for each permutation length `n`.**
