The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, and `ind` is `n - 4`. Therefore, `p[n]` will be assigned the value `n - 4`.

The list `p` initially has `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 2` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`. Since `i` is `n`, `p[n]` was initially `0` (as it was not specified to be `n - 2`), and it will now be `n - 4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ind`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 4` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`; `ind` is `n - 4`; `i` is `n`**.
