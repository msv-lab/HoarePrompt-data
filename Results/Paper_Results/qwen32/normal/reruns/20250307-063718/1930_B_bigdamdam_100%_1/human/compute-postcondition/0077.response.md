To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the list `p` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: A positive integer between 1 and 1000. It does not affect the list `p` directly.
2. **`n`**: An integer that determines the length of the list `p`.
3. **`p`**: A list of `n` elements constructed as follows:
   - Even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with values from `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n - 2*floor(n/2) + 2`.
   - Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with values from `1, 3, 5, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) + 1` if `n` is even, or `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) + 2` if `n` is odd.
4. **`ind`**: Calculated as `1 + 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is even, and `2 + 2*((n-1)//2)` if `n` is odd. This value is not directly relevant to the output of `print(*p)`.
5. **`i`**: Calculated as `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. This value is also not directly relevant to the output of `print(*p)`.

### Construction of List `p`:
- **Even indices**: These are filled in descending order starting from `n` and decrementing by 2.
- **Odd indices**: These are filled in ascending order starting from `1` (if `n` is even) or `2` (if `n` is odd) and incrementing by 2.

### Example Construction:
Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the construction of `p`:

1. **When `n` is even (e.g., `n = 6`)**:
   - Even indices: `6, 4, 2`
   - Odd indices: `1, 3, 5`
   - `p = [6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`

2. **When `n` is odd (e.g., `n = 5`)**:
   - Even indices: `5, 3, 1`
   - Odd indices: `2, 4`
   - `p = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`

### General Form:
- The list `p` alternates between the descending sequence of even-indexed values and the ascending sequence of odd-indexed values.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. The elements are constructed based on the described pattern.

### Final Output:
Output: **The elements of the list `p` are printed in the order specified, alternating between descending even-indexed values and ascending odd-indexed values.**
