The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is `n - 4`. After the operation `ind -= 2`, `ind` becomes `(n - 4) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 6`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 4`, `ind` is `n - 6`, `i` is `x + 5`**.
