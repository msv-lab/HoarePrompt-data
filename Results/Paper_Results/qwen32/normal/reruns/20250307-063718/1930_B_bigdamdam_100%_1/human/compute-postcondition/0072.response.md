The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. Given that `ind` is initially 3 if `n` is even, and 4 if `n` is odd, after incrementing by 2, `ind` becomes 5 if `n` is even, and 6 if `n` is odd. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 1; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., `n-2` or `n-3`, which are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n - 2*floor(n/2) + 2`, and at index `i` (`n` if `n` is even, `n-1` if `n` is odd), the value is `ind` (5 if `n` is even, 6 if `n` is odd); `ind` is 5 if `n` is even, 6 if `n` is odd; `i` is `n` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd**.
