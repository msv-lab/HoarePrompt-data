To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the pattern of changes in the list `p` and the variable `ind` after each iteration.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2, meaning it processes the indices 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`. For each iteration `i` in this range, it sets `p[i]` to the current value of `ind` and then increments `ind` by 2.

Let's break down the pattern:
- Initially, `p` has `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, and so on, with all other elements being 0.
- `ind` starts at `1 + n % 2`.

Each iteration of the loop assigns `ind` to the next odd-indexed element of `p` and increments `ind` by 2. The loop stops when it has processed all odd indices less than `n`.

### Final Output State Calculation:
- The final value of `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`.
- The number of iterations is the number of odd numbers from 1 to `n-1`, which is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd. This simplifies to `(n // 2)` for both cases.
- Therefore, the final value of `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n // 2) = 1 + n % 2 + n - n % 2 = n + 1`.

### Final List `p`:
- `p[0] = n`
- `p[2] = n-2`
- `p[4] = n-4`
- ...
- `p[i] = ind - 2 * ((i + 1) // 2)` for odd `i`
- `ind` starts at `1 + n % 2` and increments by 2 for each odd index `i`.

The final list `p` will have:
- `p[1] = 1 + n % 2`
- `p[3] = 3 + n % 2`
- `p[5] = 5 + n % 2`
- ...
- `p[n-1] = n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `p[n-2] = n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `p` will have the even indices set as initially defined and the odd indices set to `1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ..., up to `n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even. The final value of `ind` will be `n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is the first integer from the input line, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[1] = 1 + n % 2`, `p[3] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[5] = 5 + n % 2`, ..., `p[n-1] = n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `p[n-2] = n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even, and `ind` is `n + 1`.**
