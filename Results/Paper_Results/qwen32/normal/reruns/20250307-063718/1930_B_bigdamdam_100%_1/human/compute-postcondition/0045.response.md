The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the element at index `i` of the list `p` with the value of `ind`. Given the initial state, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`, and `i` is `i + 2`. Since the initial value of `i` is not given, we will keep it as `i + 2`. The list `p` is described with specific patterns for its elements, but only the element at index `i` is changed.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, the element at index `i` is `3 + n % 2`, the element at index `i + 2` is `1 + n % 2`, and all other elements are `0`, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`, `i` is `i + 2`**.
