The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Given that `ind` was initially `n - 4`, after the operation, `ind` becomes `n - 6`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` which is `n - 4` and `p[n - 2]` which is `n - 2`; `ind` is `n - 6`; `i` is `n`**
