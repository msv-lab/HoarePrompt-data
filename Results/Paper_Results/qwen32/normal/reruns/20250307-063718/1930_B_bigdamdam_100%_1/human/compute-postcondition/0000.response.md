In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer read from standard input. The loop variable is `i`, and the range is determined by the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is a positive integer. The loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be initialized by the `range` function.
- The value of `t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Since `t` is read from standard input, we need to ensure that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case.
