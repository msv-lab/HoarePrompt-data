The code snippet `p = [0] * n` initializes the list `p` with `n` zeros, overwriting the previous values in `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` remains the same
- `p` is initially a list of `n` elements with specific values at even and odd indices
- `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`
- `i` is `x + 1`

After executing `p = [0] * n`, `p` is now a list of `n` zeros. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` remains the same, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`, `i` is `x + 1`**
