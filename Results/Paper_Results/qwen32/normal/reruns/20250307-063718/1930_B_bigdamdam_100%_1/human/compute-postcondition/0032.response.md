Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `n` and the rest are `0`, `ind` is `n-2`.**

Natural Language: The variable `ind` has been decremented by 2, so its new value is `n-2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
