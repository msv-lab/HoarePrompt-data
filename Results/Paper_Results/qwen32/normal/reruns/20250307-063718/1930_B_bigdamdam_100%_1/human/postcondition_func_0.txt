The function reads from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a permutation `p` of length `n`. The permutation `p` is such that elements at even indices are filled in descending order starting from `n`, and elements at odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from `1 + n % 2`. The function then prints the constructed permutation for each test case.
