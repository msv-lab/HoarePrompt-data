The code snippet `p = [0] * n` creates a new list `p` with `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. This overwrites the previous list `p` with the new list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ind`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` is the first integer from the input line; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`; `ind` is `n + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
