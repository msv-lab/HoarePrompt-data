Precondition: **The function receives no direct input arguments. Instead, it should read from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
