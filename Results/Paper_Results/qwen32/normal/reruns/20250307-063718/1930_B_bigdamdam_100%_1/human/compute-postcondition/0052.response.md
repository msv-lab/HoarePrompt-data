The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the input. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` remains the same
- `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, and elements at odd indices `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1` are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`
- `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`

The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Since the loop will run for `int(input())` times, the state of `i` is the only thing that needs to be adjusted.

Let's assume that `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` remains the same, `p` is a list of `n` elements where elements at even indices `0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2)*2` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2)`, and elements at odd indices `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1` are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., 1 + n % 2 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n-1)//2`, `i` is `x + 1`**
