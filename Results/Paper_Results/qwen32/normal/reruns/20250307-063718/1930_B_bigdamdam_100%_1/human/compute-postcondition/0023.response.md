The code snippet increments the variable `ind` by 2. Given that `ind` is initially `5 + n % 2`, after the increment, `ind` becomes `7 + n % 2`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `ind` is updated to `7 + n % 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[5 + n % 2] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[7 + n % 2] = 5 + n % 2`, and `p[i] = 1 + n % 2` where `i` is an unspecified index, `ind` is `7 + n % 2`, `i` is `7 + n % 2`**.
