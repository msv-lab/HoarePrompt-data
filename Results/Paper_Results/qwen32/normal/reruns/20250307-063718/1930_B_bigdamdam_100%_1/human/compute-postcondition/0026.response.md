To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that appear in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer input. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` is the first integer from the input line
- `p` is a list of `n` elements with a specific pattern
- `ind` is `n + 1`

The variable `i` is not mentioned in the provided state, but based on typical loop behavior, `i` would have been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it was `i - 1` at the start of the previous iteration, and thus `i` should now be `i`.

However, since we need to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and `i` would have been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we adjust `i` to be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `ind`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is the first integer from the input line, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[1] = 1 + n % 2`, `p[3] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[5] = 5 + n % 2`, ..., `p[n-1] = n - 1 + n % 2` if `n` is odd, or `p[n-2] = n - 2 + n % 2` if `n` is even, `ind` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
