Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[5 + n % 2] = 3 + n % 2`, and `p[i] = 1 + n % 2` where `i` is an unspecified index, `ind` is `5 + n % 2`, `i` is `5 + n % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, so it changes from `3 + n % 2` to `5 + n % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
