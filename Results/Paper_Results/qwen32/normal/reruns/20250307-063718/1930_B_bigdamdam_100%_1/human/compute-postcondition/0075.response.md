Initial State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 1; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., `n-2` or `n-3`, which are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n - 2*floor(n/2) + 2`, and at index `i` (`n` if `n` is even, `n-1` if `n` is odd), the value is `ind` (5 if `n` is even, 6 if `n` is odd); `ind` is 5 if `n` is even, 6 if `n` is odd; `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even, or `n-3` if `n` is odd

Given the code snippet:
```
ind += 2
```

The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. Therefore, if `ind` was 5 (when `n` is even), it becomes 7. If `ind` was 6 (when `n` is odd), it becomes 8.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3); `n` must be greater than 1; `p` is a list of `n` zeros except at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., `n-2` or `n-3`, which are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n - 2*floor(n/2) + 2`, and at index `i` (`n` if `n` is even, `n-1` if `n` is odd), the value is `ind` (7 if `n` is even, 8 if `n` is odd); `ind` is 7 if `n` is even, 8 if `n` is odd; `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even, or `n-3` if `n` is odd**.
