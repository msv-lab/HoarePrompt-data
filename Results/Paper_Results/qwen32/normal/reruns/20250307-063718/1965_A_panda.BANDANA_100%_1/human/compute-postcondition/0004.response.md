The code snippet converts the map object `l` into a set to remove any duplicate values, sorts the resulting set, and assigns it to the variable `lis`. This process does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, and `i` remains uninitialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.**
