The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the result of `len(lis)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(lis)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute, as the loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 and continues as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test` are provided. However, only `j` and `len(lis)` can be adjusted:

- `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but the loop initializes `j` to 1, so we don't need to adjust `j` before the loop.
- `len(lis)` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure `len(lis)` is greater than 1, `lis` must contain at least two unique integers. Since `lis` is derived from `l` (a map object containing integers), we need to ensure that `l` contains at least two unique integers.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `test` is True**
