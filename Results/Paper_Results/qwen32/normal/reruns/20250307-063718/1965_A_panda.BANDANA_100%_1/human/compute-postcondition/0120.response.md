Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the program has read an integer `n` and a list of integers `l`. It then creates a sorted list of unique integers `lis` from `l`. Based on the conditions specified in the loop, the program prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. After all iterations, `i` equals `t - 1`, and no further changes are made to `t`, `n`, `l`, or `lis` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each case, it determined and printed the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the given conditions. After completing all iterations, the loop index `i` will be `t - 1`, and the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `lis` will reflect the state from the last test case processed.
