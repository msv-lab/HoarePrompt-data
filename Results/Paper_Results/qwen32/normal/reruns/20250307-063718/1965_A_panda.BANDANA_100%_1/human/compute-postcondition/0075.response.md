The given `print` statement is `print('Alice')`. This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` to the console. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `test`, and `j`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is printing a literal string, the output will be exactly `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
