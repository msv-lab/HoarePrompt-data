Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `j` equals the length of `lis`, and `test` is True. The length of `lis` is either odd or even.**

This postcondition captures the state of the program variables after the if-else block, considering both possible outcomes of the condition `len(lis) % 2 == 1`. The only difference between the if and else parts is whether the length of `lis` is odd or even, but all other variables remain unchanged.
