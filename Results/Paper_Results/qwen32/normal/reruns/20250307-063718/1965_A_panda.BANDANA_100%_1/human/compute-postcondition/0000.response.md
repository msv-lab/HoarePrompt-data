Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which specifies the number of test cases. The other conditions about the test cases (the number of piles `n` and the list of integers representing stones in each pile) remain unchanged as they have not been processed yet.
