Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `test` is True indicating no differences greater than 1 were found, and `j` is the index at which the loop stopped. The current value of `test` is True.**
