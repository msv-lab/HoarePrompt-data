Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, the program does not modify `test`. Otherwise, `test` is True indicating no differences greater than 1 were found in `lis`. The length of `lis` remains unchanged and is either odd or even. If the else part is executed, `j` equals the length of `lis`.**
