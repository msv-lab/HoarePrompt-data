The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `j` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement since the statement is printing a static string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
