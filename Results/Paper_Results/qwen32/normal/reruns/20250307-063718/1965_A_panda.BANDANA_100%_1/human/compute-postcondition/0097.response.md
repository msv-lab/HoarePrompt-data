The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `len(lis)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lis`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with more than one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here is the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `j` is 2**
