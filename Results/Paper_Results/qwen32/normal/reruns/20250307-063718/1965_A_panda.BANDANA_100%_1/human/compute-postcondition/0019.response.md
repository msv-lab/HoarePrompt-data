The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the implicit length of `lis`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lis`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was used to index into `lis`, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `lis`.

Given that `j` is not yet initialized before the loop starts, at the start of the first iteration, `j` should be set to 1, as the loop is defined to start from 1 (`range(1, len(lis))`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the first (or next) iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
