To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the possible scenarios based on the given loop and initial conditions.

The loop iterates over the sorted list of unique integers `lis` starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between the current element and the previous one is greater than 1. If this condition is met, it prints either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of the current index `j`, sets `test` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met, the loop continues.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop has executed at least 3 times, indicating that `lis` has at least 4 elements.
- No differences greater than 1 were found in the first 3 iterations, otherwise the loop would have broken earlier.

The loop will continue until it either finds a difference greater than 1 or iterates through all elements in `lis`.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `l` remains the map object containing the input integers.
- `lis` remains the sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `test` will be False if a difference greater than 1 is found during the loop; otherwise, it will remain True.
- `j` will be the index at which the loop stopped, either because it found a difference greater than 1 or because it finished iterating through `lis`.

If the loop completes all iterations without finding a difference greater than 1, `test` will be True, and `j` will be equal to `len(lis) - 1`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `test` is True if no differences greater than 1 were found, otherwise False, and `j` is the index at which the loop stopped.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. `lis` remains the same sorted list of unique integers. `test` will be True if no gaps greater than 1 were found between consecutive elements in `lis`; otherwise, it will be False. `j` will be the index where the loop stopped, either because a gap was found or because the loop completed all iterations.
