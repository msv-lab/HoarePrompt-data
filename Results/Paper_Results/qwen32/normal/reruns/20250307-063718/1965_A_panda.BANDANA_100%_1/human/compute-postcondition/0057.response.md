Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False, and `j` retains its parity (odd or even). If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, then `test` remains True.**
