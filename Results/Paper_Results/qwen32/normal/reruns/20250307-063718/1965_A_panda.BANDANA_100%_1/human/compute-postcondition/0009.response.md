To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `j` and the range function parameters.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the `range(1, len(lis))` must produce at least one value. This means that the length of `lis` must be greater than 1, because `range(1, len(lis))` will generate values starting from 1 up to, but not including, `len(lis)`. If `len(lis)` is 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given that the problem statement already specifies that the length of `lis` is greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the length of `lis`.

The variable `j` does not need to be initialized before the loop starts because it is assigned a value by the `range` function in each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments regarding the loop head variables `j` and the range function parameters.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True**
