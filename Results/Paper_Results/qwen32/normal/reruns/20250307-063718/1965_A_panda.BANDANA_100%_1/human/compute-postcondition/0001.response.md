The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized**
