Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `test` is True, and `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. If `j` is an odd integer, then `j` remains an odd integer. If `j` is an even integer, then `j` remains an even integer.**
