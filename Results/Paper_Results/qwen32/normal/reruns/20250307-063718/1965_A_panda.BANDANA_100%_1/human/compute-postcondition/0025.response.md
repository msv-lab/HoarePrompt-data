Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described without any changes to `test` or breaking out of any loop.**
