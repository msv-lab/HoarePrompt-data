The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by the length of `lis`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to the next value it would take in the iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. The loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False, and `j` retains its parity (odd or even). If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, then `test` remains True, `j` is 2**
