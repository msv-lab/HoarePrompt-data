Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `j` equals the length of `lis`, and `test` is True. The length of `lis` is either odd or even.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition since the `else` part is `None` and the `if` part does not alter any of the variables beyond confirming the conditions stated in the precondition.
