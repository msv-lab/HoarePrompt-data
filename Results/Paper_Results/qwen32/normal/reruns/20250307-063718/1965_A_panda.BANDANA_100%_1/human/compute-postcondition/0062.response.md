The code snippet sets the variable `test` to `False`. This change affects the value of `test` while leaving all other variables unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements. If `j` is odd, `j` retains its parity (odd or even). If `j` is even, `j` retains its parity (odd or even). `test` is False.**
