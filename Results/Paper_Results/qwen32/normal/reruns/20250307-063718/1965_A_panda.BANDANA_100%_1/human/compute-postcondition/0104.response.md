The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it iterates over, which is dependent on `len(lis)`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. Since the loop iterates over `range(1, len(lis))`, the next value for `j` should be the next integer in this range, which is 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `j` is 3**
