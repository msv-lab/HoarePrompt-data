Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements. If `j` is odd, `j` retains its parity (odd or even). If `j` is even, `j` retains its parity (odd or even). If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, then `test` remains True.**

The postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `lis` retain their initial states as described in the precondition. The variable `j` retains its parity (whether it is odd or even), and the variable `test` is set to False if the difference between consecutive elements in `lis` is greater than 1, otherwise, it remains True.
