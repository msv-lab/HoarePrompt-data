Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 2, and `test` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
