Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is not yet initialized.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- Either 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` contains only one element.

### Print Statement:
```
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement simply prints the string 'Alice'. There are no variables or conditions that influence the content of the string being printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and the state of `i` do not affect what this print statement will output.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
