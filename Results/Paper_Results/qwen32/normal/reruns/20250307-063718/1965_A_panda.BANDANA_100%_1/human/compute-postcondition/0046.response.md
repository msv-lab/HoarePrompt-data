The provided initial state describes several variables and objects, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables or objects. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `lis`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
