Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, and `j` is 3. The condition `j % 2 == 1` is always true since `j` is 3, so the if part is executed, but the postcondition remains the same as the precondition because no changes are specified in either the if or else part.**
