The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, or `test` because it directly outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`.
2. The string `'Alice'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, and `test` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
4. Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables, the output will always be the string `'Alice'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Alice**
