Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is `len(lis) - 1`, and `test` is True. The length of `lis` is either odd or even.**
