To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is not yet initialized.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it, and the length of `lis` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is initialized to 2.
   - There is a conditional statement checking if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. If true, `test` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions in the initial state.

**Explanation:**
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable or condition in the initial state. It will always output the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
