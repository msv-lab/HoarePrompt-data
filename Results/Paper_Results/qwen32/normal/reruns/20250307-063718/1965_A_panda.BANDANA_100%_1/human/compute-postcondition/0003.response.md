The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and maps these integers to `l`. The variable `l` is now a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `i` remains uninitialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.**
