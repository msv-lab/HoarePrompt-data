Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
