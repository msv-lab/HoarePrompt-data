The provided initial state describes several variables and objects, but it does not indicate that the value of any of these variables or objects is used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'Alice' to the console. None of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j` are referenced in this statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **Alice**
