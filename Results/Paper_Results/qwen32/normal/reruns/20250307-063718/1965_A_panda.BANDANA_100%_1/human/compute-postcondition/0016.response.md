Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False, and `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. Additionally, `j` is either an odd integer or an even integer.**

In simpler terms, the value of `test` has been changed to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
