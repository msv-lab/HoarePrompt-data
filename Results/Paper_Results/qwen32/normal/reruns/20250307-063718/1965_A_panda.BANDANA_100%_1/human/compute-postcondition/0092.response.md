The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values or conditions of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `test`, or `j`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, inclusive.
2. The variable `i` is set to 1.
3. The variable `n` is an input integer.
4. The variable `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
5. The variable `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
6. The variable `test` is set to True.
7. The condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` is true, and `j` is even.

Despite all these variables and conditions, the print statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the other variables or the conditions.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Alice**
