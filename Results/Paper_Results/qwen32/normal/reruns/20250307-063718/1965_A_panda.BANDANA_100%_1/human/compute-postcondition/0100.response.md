Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, and `j` is 2. The if-else block does not change any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j`.**

Since the if condition `j % 2 == 1` is false (as `j` is 2), the else part is executed, but both the if and else parts do not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same after the if-else block.
