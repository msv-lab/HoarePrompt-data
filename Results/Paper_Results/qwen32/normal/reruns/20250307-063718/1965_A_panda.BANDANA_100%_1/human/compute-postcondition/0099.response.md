The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`) are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
   - `j` is initialized to 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('Alice')` statement is executed.

3. **Output**:
   - The string `'Alice'` is printed to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state, the output is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
