The code snippet `lis = sorted(set(l))` updates the `lis` variable by converting the map object `l` into a set to remove duplicates, and then sorting the resulting set. This means `lis` will now contain unique integers from `l` in sorted order.

Given this, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `l` remains a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is now a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.

The conditions regarding `j` and `test` are dependent on the new state of `lis`, but they are not affected by the current line of code. Therefore, if `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` contains only one element, no additional changes are made to `j` and `test`. If `1` is in `lis` and `lis` contains more than one element, `j` is set to `len(lis) - 1` and `test` is set to True, but these conditions are not evaluated by the current line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.**
