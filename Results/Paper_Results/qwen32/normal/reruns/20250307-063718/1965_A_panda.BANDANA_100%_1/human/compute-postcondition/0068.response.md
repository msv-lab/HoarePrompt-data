Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, and `j` is 2. The if condition `j % 2 == 1` is not met since `j` is 2, so the else part is executed, which does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j`.**
