The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still not initialized. The output state includes the updated value of `n` as an integer from the input, while `t` retains its initial value within the range 1 to 10^4, and `i` remains uninitialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer**.
