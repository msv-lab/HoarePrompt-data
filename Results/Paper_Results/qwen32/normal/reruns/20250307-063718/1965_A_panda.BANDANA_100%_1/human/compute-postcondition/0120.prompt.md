Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` contains only one element, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `j` is set to `len(lis) - 1` and `test` is set to True. The length of `lis` is either odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, the program does not modify `test`. Otherwise, `test` is True indicating no differences greater than 1 were found in `lis`. The length of `lis` remains unchanged, whether it is odd or even, and `j` is the index at which the loop stopped if the else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, the program does not modify `test`. Otherwise, `test` is True indicating no differences greater than 1 were found in `lis`. The length of `lis` remains unchanged and is either odd or even. If the else part is executed, `j` equals the length of `lis`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
