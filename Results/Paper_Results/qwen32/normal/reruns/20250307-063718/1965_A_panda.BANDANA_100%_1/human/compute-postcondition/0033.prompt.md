Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. The number 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described without any changes to `test` or breaking out of any loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 in it and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described without any changes to `test` or breaking out of any loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
