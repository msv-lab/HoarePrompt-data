The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `len(lis)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The length of `lis` remains unchanged.

Given the conditions provided, we do not need to adjust `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `lis` because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 2**
