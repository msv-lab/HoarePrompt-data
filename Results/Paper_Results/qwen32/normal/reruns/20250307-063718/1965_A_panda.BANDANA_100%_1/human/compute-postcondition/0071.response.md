Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing at least two unique integers, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
