The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`) but none of them are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Let's break down the relevant information:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `i`: Initialized to 1.
- `n`: An input integer.
- `l`: A map object containing integers from new input.
- `lis`: A sorted list of unique integers from `l` with more than one element.
- `j`: Initialized to 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `j`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **Bob**
