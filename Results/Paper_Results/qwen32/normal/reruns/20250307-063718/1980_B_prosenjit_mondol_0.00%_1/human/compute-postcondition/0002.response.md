Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `f` has been decreased by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
