The value of `x` is assigned the value of the element at index `f` in the list `a`. Since `f` is defined as an integer read from the input minus 1, `x` will hold the value of `a[f]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is `a[f]`.**
