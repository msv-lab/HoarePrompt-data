Output State: **t iterations have been completed, and for each iteration, the program has read values for n, f, and k, processed a list a of n integers, and printed either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations specified by `t` have finished, the program will have gone through each test case, read the necessary inputs, sorted the list `a` in descending order, and compared the elements at positions `f` and `k` to determine and print the appropriate result ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE') for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will have been updated accordingly for each iteration, but the overall structure and constraints (1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, 1 <= a_i <= 100) will remain consistent with the initial conditions.
