The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` will be the integers read from the input, and `t` will retain its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
