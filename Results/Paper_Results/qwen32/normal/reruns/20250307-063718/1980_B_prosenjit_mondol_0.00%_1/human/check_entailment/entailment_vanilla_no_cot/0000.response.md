To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

The program logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of cubes to be removed `k`.
2. It adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-based indices.
3. It reads the list of cube values `a`.
4. It stores the value of the favorite cube `x`.
5. It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
6. It then checks the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list `a[k]` against the value of the favorite cube `x`:
   - If `a[k] > x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube will not be removed (since it's greater than the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list).
   - If `a[k] < x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed (since it's less than the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list).
   - If `a[k] == x`, it checks if `k` is the last index or if the value at `a[k-1]` is less than `x`:
     - If `k` is the last index or `a[k-1] < x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube is the last one or there's a cube with a smaller value after it, so it will be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube could be removed or not depending on the arrangement of cubes with the same value.

The logic appears correct as it covers all possible scenarios:
- If the favorite cube's value is greater than the `k`-th cube value, it will not be removed.
- If the favorite cube's value is less than the `k`-th cube value, it will be removed.
- If the favorite cube's value is equal to the `k`-th cube value, the program correctly determines if it will be removed based on the position and the values of surrounding cubes.

Thus, the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
