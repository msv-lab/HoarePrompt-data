### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each.

3. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - It stores the value of the favorite cube `x = a[f]`.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - If the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list `a[k]` is greater than `x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed.
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it further checks:
     - If `k` is the last index or the value at `k-1` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube could be either removed or left depending on the exact ordering of cubes with the same value.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `5 2 2`, `4 3 3 2 3`
   - `f` is adjusted to 1, `k` to 1.
   - Favorite cube value `x = 3`.
   - Sorted list: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
   - `a[1]` is 3, which is equal to `x`.
   - `k` is not the last index and `a[0]` is 4, which is greater than `x`.
   - Output: 'MAYBE' (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `5 5 3`, `4 2 1 3 5`
   - `f` is adjusted to 4, `k` to 2.
