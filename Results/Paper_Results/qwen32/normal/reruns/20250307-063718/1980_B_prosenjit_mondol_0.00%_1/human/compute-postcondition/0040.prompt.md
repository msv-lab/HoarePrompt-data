Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input and sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f - 1]`. If `a[k]` was greater than `a[f - 1]` before sorting, then `a[k]` is still greater than `a[f]` after sorting. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `a[f]`. `f` is decreased by 1; `k` is decreased by 1. The condition `a[k] > x` or `a[k] < x` does not affect the postcondition as both the if and else parts result in the same state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the condition `a[k] > x` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a[k] <= x` holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
