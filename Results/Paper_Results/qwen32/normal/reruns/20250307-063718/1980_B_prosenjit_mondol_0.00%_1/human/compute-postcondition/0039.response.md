Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the condition `a[k] > x` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a[k] <= x` holds true.**
