t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, an integer f such that 1 <= f <= n, an integer k such that 1 <= k <= n, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
