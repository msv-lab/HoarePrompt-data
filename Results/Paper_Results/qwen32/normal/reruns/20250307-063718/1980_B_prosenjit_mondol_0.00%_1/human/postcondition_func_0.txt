The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and prints whether the `k`-th largest element in the list is greater than, less than, or potentially equal to the element at index `f` (0-based), printing 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly.
