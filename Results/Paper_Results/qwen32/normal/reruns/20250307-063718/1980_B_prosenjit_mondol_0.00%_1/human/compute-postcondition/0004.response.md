The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer, storing these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged by this code.

Given the initial state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are derived from input but are not altered by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
