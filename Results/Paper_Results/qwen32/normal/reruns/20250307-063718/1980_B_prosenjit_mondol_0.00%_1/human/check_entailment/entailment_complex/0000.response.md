### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` cubes, each with a value `a_i`.
   - One of the cubes is Dmitry's favorite, identified by its index `f`.
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
   - The first `k` cubes are removed.
   - We need to determine if the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it could be either removed or left.

2. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`.
   - The favorite cube's value is stored (`x = a[f]`).
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then checks the value at position `k` in the sorted list:
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube cannot be in the first `k` positions, so it is never removed (`print('NO')`).
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely in the first `k` positions, so it is always removed (`print('YES')`).
     - If `a[k] == x`, the program checks if `k` is the last position (`k == n - 1`) or if the value at `a[k-1]` is less than `x`. If `k` is the last position or `a[k-1] < x`, the favorite cube is never removed (`print('YES')`); otherwise, it could be either removed or left (`print('MAYBE')`).

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly covers all scenarios:
     - If the `k`-th largest cube has a value greater than the favorite cube, the favorite cube will never be removed.
     - If the `k`-th largest cube has a value less than the favorite cube, the favorite cube will always be removed.
     - If the `k`-th largest cube has the same value as the favorite cube, the final decision depends on the position and the values around it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given conditions and examples.

**Correctness: True**
