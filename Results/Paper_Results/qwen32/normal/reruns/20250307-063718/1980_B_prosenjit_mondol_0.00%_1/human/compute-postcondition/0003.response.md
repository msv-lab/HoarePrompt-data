The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `f`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input minus 2.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from the input; `f` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from the input minus 2.**
