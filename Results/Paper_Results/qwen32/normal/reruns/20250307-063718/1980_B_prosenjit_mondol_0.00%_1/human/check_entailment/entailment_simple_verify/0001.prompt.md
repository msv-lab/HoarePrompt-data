You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cubes.
     - `f`: Index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1-indexed).
     - `k`: Number of cubes to be removed.
     - `a`: List of values on the cubes.

2. **Process:**
   - Convert `f` and `k` to 0-indexed.
   - Store the value of the favorite cube (`x = a[f]`).
   - Sort the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - Determine the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list.
   - Based on the position of the favorite cube and the number `k`:
     - If the favorite cube's value is less than the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list, it will not be removed (`NO`).
     - If the favorite cube's value is greater than the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list, it will be removed (`YES`).
     - If the favorite cube's value is equal to the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list:
       - If `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`), the favorite cube will not be removed (`YES`).
       - If the value at the `(k-1)`-th position is less than the favorite cube's value, it will be removed (`YES`).
       - Otherwise, it may be either removed or left (`MAYBE`).

### Program Analysis

The program correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`.
   - `f` and `k` are adjusted to be 0-indexed.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - The value of the favorite cube (`x`) is compared with the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list.
   - Based on the comparison, it prints `NO`, `YES`, or `MAYBE` as required.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be either removed or left based on the provided inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
