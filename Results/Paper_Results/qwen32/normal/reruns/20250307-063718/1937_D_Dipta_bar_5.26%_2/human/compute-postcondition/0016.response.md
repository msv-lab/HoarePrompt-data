The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, `i`, and the calculation for `x` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The new state of `A` will include the newly appended value `x` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.
