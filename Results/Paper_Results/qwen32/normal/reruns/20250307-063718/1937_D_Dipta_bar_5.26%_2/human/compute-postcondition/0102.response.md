Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is 0, the current value of `l` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
