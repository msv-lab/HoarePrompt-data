Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `B`, but it is given that `r` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
   - `l` is not less than `r`, but since `r` is 0, this condition is trivially satisfied.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`, which means it will print the value of `n - i` followed by a space.

3. **Variable Values:**
   - We know `r` is 0, but this doesn't directly affect `n` or `i`.
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `i` is the index of a '>' character in the string `s`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is the index of a '>' character and `n` is greater than 0, the value of `n - i` will be the difference between `n` and the index `i`.

Given the information, the output will be the value of `n - i` followed by a space. However, we don't have the exact values of `n` and `i`, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - i (where n is greater than 0 and i is the index of a '>' character in the string `s`)**
