To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

### Given Information:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is decremented by 1.
- `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`: This is the expression whose value will be printed.
- `end=' '`: This specifies that the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `a`**:
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `A[l - 1]` is an integer from the list `A`.
   - `i - idx_A[l - 1]` is the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last '>' character in `idx_A`.
   - `l` is a multiplier, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information but is assumed to be a known value.

2. **Value of `b`**:
   - `b` is updated as `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - `idx_B[r]` is the index of the last '<' character in `idx_B`.
   - `idx_B[r] - i` is the difference between the index of the last '<' character and the current index `i`.
   - `l` is a multiplier.

3. **Expression to be Printed**:
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values of `a` and `b`:
     - `a * 2` becomes `2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l)`.
     - `b * 2` becomes `2 * (b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l)`.
     - Adding `i + 1` to the above expression gives the final value to be printed.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps, the print statement will output the calculated value of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, i is the current index incremented by 1, and l is a multiplier)**
