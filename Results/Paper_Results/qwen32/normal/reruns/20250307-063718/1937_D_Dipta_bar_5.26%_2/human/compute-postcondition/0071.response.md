Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **String `s`**: Contains characters, including '>' and '<'.
2. **`idx_A`**: List of indices where '>' characters are found in the string `s`.
3. **`A`**: List of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters. The exact calculation isn't specified, but we know it's derived from `idx_A`.
4. **`idx_B`**: List of indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`.
5. **`B`**: List of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters. The exact calculation isn't specified, but we know it's derived from `idx_B`.
6. **`l`**: Initialized to 0.
7. **`r`**: Initialized to the length of `B`.
8. **`n`**: Greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
9. **Current character at index `i` in the string `s`**: '>'.
10. **`l` is less than `r`**: Ensures that there are elements in `B` to consider.
11. **`a`**: The first element of `A`, i.e., `A[0]`.
12. **`b`**: Calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:

- **`a * 2`**: Twice the first element of `A`.
- **`b * 2`**: Twice the value of `b`.
- **`i + 1`**: The index `i` plus 1.

### Calculation:

1. **`a`**: This is `A[0]`, the first element of the list `A`.
2. **`b`**: Calculated using the formula `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]`: The last index in the list `idx_B` (since `r` is the length of `B`).
   - `i`: The current index in the string `s` where the character is '>'.
   - `l`: Initialized to 0, so `l + 1` is 1.
   - Therefore, `b` simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] - i`.
3. **`a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`**: Combining the above, this becomes `2 * A[0] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - i) + i + 1`.

### Output:

The print statement will output the calculated value of the expression `2 * A[0] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - i) + i + 1`.

Output: **2 * A[0] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - i) + i + 1**
