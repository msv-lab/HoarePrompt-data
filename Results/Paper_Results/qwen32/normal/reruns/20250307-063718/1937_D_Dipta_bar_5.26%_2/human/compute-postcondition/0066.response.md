Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
