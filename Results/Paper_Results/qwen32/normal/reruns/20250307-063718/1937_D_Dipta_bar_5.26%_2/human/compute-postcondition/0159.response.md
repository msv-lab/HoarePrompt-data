Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is set to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decremented by 1. If `l <= r`, if `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
