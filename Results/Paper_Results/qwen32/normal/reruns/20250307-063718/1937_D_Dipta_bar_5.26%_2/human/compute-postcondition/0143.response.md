The code snippet `b = b - B[r - l]` modifies the value of `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is initially `B[r]`. After the execution of the code, `b` becomes `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**
