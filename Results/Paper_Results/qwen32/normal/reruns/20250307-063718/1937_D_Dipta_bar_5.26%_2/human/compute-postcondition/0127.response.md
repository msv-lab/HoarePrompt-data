To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

Initial State:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in a string `s`.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we understand that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the exact values of `n` and `i` are not specified directly. We only know that `i` has been incremented by 1 at some point before this print statement.

Given this information:
- `n - i` represents the difference between `n` and the current value of `i`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, if we assume `i` was `x` before the increment, now `i` is `x + 1`. Therefore, the value printed will be `n - (x + 1)`.

Without the specific values of `n` and `i`, we can't determine a numerical output, but we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output: **n - i (where n is a positive integer and i is an integer incremented by 1)**
