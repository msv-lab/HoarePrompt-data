To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first three iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s`: A string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n`: Length of the string `s`.
- `A`: An empty list.
- `idx_A`: An empty list.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` (from index `0` to `n-1`). For each character:
- If the character is `'>':
  - If `idx_A` is empty, `0` is appended to `A`.
  - Otherwise, a new element `x` is appended to `A`, calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
  - The current index `i` is appended to `idx_A`.
- If the character is `'<'`, no changes are made to `A` or `idx_A`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
Let's break down the final state after the loop completes all iterations.

1. **`s`**: Remains unchanged as the string of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **`n`**: Remains unchanged as the length of the string `s`.
3. **`A`**: This list will contain a series of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
4. **`idx_A`**: This list will contain the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.

The final output state can be described as:
- `A` will contain a list of integers where each integer is calculated based on the positions of '>' characters and the current state of `A` and `idx_A` at each step.
- `idx_A` will contain all the indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example string `s = "><>>"` to illustrate the final state:

- **Iteration 1 (i=0)**: `s[0] = '>'`, `idx_A` is empty, so `A = [0]` and `idx_A = [0]`.
- **Iteration 2 (i=1)**: `s[1] = '<'`, no changes, so `A = [0]` and `idx_A = [0]`.
- **Iteration 3 (i=2)**: `s[2] = '>'`, `idx_A` is not empty, calculate `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A) = 0 + (2 - 0) * 1 = 2`, so `A = [0, 2]` and `idx_A = [0, 2]`.
- **Iteration 4 (i=3)**: `s[3] = '>'`, `idx_A` is not empty, calculate `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A) = 2 + (3 - 2) * 2 = 4`, so `A = [0, 2, 4]` and `idx_A = [0, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the final output state for `s = "><>>"` is:
- `A = [0, 2, 4]`
- `idx_A = [0, 2, 3]`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, and `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.**

In natural language, the final output state means that `A` contains a series of integers derived from the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, and `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.
