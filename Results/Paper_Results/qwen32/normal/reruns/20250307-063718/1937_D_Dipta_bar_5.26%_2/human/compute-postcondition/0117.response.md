Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is either '>' or not '>'. If the character at index `i` is '>', then `l` is 1 and `r` remains the length of `B`. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, and `r` is 0, no further action is taken. If `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `((A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`; otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If the character at index `i` is not '>', then `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `l` is not 0, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `a` is the last element of `B` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0.**
