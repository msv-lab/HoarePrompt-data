The code snippet `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given that `x` is calculated as `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`, this value is added to `B`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list containing the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`, `idx_B` is a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `s[i]` is '<'.**
