### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell in the grid, given the initial state of the grid. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell it is currently in ('<' or '>'), and the character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves out of it. The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid either from the left or right border.

The provided program seems to follow a strategy to efficiently calculate the number of steps for each cell by precomputing certain values based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Precomputation for '>' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the grid to find the positions of '>' characters.
   - It calculates a list `A` where `A[i]` represents the accumulated effect of the '>' characters up to the `i`-th '>' character.
   - It also maintains a list `idx_A` to store the indices of '>' characters.

3. **Precomputation for '<' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the grid in reverse to find the positions of '<' characters.
   - It calculates a list `B` where `B[i]` represents the accumulated effect of the '<' characters up to the `i`-th '<' character from the end.
   - It also maintains a list `idx_B` to store the indices of '<' characters.

4. **Calculation for Each Cell**:
   - For each cell in the grid, it determines whether the pinball starts moving to the right ('>') or to the left ('<').
   - It uses the precomputed lists `A` and `B` to calculate the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic involves combining the accumulated effects of '>' and '<' characters and adjusting based on the current position and direction of the pinball.

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the number of steps for each cell in the grid.

The provided code seems to correctly implement the above logic. The precomputation steps allow the program to efficiently calculate the number of steps for each cell by leveraging the accumulated effects of '>' and '<' characters. The final calculations consider the direction of movement and the accumulated effects to determine the exact number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell, based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
