Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`A`**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. **`idx_A`**: A list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
3. **`B`**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
4. **`idx_B`**: A list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
5. **`l`**: Initially set to 0.
6. **`r`**: Initially set to the length of `B` minus 1.
7. **`n`**: Greater than 0.
8. **Character at position `i` in the string `s`**: Not '>'.
9. **`l > r`**: This condition is given, but since `r` is initially set to `len(B) - 1` and `l` is 0, this condition cannot hold unless `B` is an empty list. Given `r` is 0, it implies `B` is an empty list.
10. **Current value of `r`**: 0.

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

Let's analyze each part of the expression:
- **`n - i`**: This is a straightforward subtraction of `i` from `n`.
- **`(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`**: This part involves subtracting `idx_A[l - 1]` from `i` and then multiplying the result by 2.

However, there is a critical issue with the expression `idx_A[l - 1]`:
- Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` would be `-1`.
- Accessing `idx_A[-1]` means accessing the last element of the list `idx_A`.

### Given Constraints
- We know `l > r` and `r` is 0, which implies `l` must be greater than 0 for this condition to hold. However, `l` is initially 0, so this condition seems contradictory unless `idx_A` is empty.
- If `idx_A` is empty, `idx_A[-1]` would raise an `IndexError`.

Given the constraints and the contradictory nature of `l > r` with `l` being 0, let's assume the problem is implying that `idx_A` is empty or `l` is adjusted to a valid index before this print statement is reached. Since `l > r` and `r` is 0, the only way this makes sense is if `l` is adjusted to a valid index or `idx_A` is empty.

However, if we assume the problem is correctly set up and `l` is valid (which seems contradictory given `l` is 0), let’s proceed with the assumption that `l` is adjusted to a valid index or `idx_A` is non-empty.

### Assuming `l` is adjusted to a valid index:
Let’s assume `l` is adjusted to 1 (the smallest valid index after 0) and `idx_A` has at least one element.

### Simplified Calculation:
- Let's assume `idx_A[0]` is some valid index, say `x`.
- The expression becomes `n - i + (i - x) * 2`.

### Final Output:
Given the assumptions, the output will be:
- `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`

Since the exact values of `n`, `i`, and `idx_A[l - 1]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is greater than 0, i is a valid index in the string s, and idx_A[l - 1] is the element at index l-1 in the list idx_A)**

However, given the contradictory nature of `l > r` with `l` being 0, the most precise description is that the expression is not well-defined under the given initial conditions. Assuming `l` is adjusted, the output is as described above.
