The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be 1 and `n` should remain the same.

State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end. If `idx_B` was empty before this operation, `B` contains the integer 0; otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.**
