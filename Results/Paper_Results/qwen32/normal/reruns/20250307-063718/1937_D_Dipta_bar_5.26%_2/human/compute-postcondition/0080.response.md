The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting a calculated expression from its current value. The expression `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` is subtracted from `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is initially `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.
- The expression `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` is subtracted from `b`.

The new value of `b` becomes:
\[ b = (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) \]

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>'. Additionally, `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `(A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**.
