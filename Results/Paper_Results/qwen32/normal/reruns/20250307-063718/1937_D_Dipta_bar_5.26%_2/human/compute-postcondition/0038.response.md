Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list containing the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`. `idx_B` is a list that may or may not be empty. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `s[i]` is '<'.**
