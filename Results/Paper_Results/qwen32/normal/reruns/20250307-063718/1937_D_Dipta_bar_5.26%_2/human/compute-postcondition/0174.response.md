Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l - r > 0`, then `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, then `a` remains `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
