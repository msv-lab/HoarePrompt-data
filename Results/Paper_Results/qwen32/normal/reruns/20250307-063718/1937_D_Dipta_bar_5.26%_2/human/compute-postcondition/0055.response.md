The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Since `i` is `n - 3` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` has a specific value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` is a list with an additional element `n - 3` appended to it, `B` is updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `B` has an additional element `x` at the end, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`.**
