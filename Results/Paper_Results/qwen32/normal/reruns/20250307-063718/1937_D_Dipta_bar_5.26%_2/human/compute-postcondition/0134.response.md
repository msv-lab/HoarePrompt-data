To determine the exact output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the variables involved:

### Given Information:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is calculated using the formula: `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `B[r - 1]` is the last element of the list `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last element of the list `idx_B`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `r` is an index used to access elements in `B` and `idx_B`.

2. **Variable `b`**:
   - `b` is updated using the formula: `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - `b` is a previously calculated value.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is an element of the list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`.
   - `r` is an index used in the calculation.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is evaluated.
   - `a` and `b` are multiplied by 2.
   - `n - i` is added to the result.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. The exact numerical value cannot be determined without the specific values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, `l`, and `b`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1)**
