The variable `a` is assigned the value `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.
