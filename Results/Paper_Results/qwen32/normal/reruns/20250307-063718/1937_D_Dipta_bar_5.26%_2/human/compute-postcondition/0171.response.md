The given Python code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` now holds the value of the element at the index `l - 1` in the list `A`.

The values of the other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
