The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` in the string `s` is either '>' or not '>'.
- The variables `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the conditions involving `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `i`.
- The variables `a` and `b` are calculated based on the conditions involving `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, and `r`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same (since `n` is the upper limit of the loop and does not change during the loop iterations).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
