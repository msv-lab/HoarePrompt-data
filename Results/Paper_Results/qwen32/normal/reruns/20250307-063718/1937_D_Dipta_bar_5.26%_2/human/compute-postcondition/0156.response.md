Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **A**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. **idx_A**: A list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
3. **B**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
4. **idx_B**: A list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
5. **n**: An integer greater than 0.
6. **i**: An integer that has been incremented by 1.
7. **r**: An integer that has been decremented by 1.
8. **a**: The value of `B[r]`.
9. **b**: Updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `a`**: `a` is defined as `B[r]`. This means `a` is the element in list `B` at index `r`.
2. **Value of `b`**: `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Here, `b` is a cumulative sum that includes the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
3. **Value of `n`**: `n` is an integer greater than 0.
4. **Value of `i`**: `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is the current index or position after the increment.
5. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `a * 2`: Twice the value of `a`.
   - `b * 2`: Twice the value of `b`.
   - `(n - i)`: The difference between `n` and the current value of `i`.

### Output Calculation:
The print statement combines these values:
- `a * 2`: Twice the value of `B[r]`.
- `b * 2`: Twice the updated value of `b`.
- `(n - i)`: The difference between `n` and the current value of `i`.

### Final Output:
The final output is the sum of these three values, printed with a space at the end.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r], b is updated to its previous value plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), n is an integer greater than 0, and i is incremented by 1)**
