The code snippet `a = A[l]` assigns the value of the element at index `l` in list `A` to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `A[l]`.**
