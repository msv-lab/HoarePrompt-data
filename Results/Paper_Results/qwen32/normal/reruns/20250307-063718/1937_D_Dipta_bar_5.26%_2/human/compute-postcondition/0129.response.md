The code snippet `b = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A` to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, or `a`. The only change is that `b` now holds the value `A[l - 1]`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
