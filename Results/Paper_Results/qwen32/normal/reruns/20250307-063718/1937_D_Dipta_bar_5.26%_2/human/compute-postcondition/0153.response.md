The code modifies the value of `b` based on the current values of `b`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r`. Specifically, it subtracts the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the value of `l - r - 1` from the current value of `b`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.**
