Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting the expression `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
