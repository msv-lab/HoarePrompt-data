s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the state of the grid for a single test case. The length of s is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function will be called multiple times, once for each test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
