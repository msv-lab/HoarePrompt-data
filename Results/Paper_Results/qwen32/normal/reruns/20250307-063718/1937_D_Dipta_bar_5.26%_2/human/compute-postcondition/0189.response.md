To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the calculations involved in determining the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `l`.

### Breakdown of the Variables:
1. **`A` and `B` Lists**:
   - `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.

2. **`idx_A` and `idx_B` Lists**:
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.

3. **`n`**:
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.

4. **`i`**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`. Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we will denote it as `i_initial + 1`.

5. **`r`**:
   - `r` is `r - 1`. Since the initial value of `r` is not provided, we will denote it as `r_initial - 1`.

6. **`a`**:
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Here, `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we will denote it as `l`.

7. **`b`**:
   - `b` is calculated differently based on the condition `r - l >= 0`.
   - If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - If `r - l < 0`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Calculating the Output:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:
  - `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
  - `b` depends on the condition `r - l >= 0`:
    - If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
    - If `r - l < 0`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
  - `i` is `i_initial + 1`.

### Final Expression:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `i_initial`, `r_initial`, `l`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, the output expression can be described as follows:

Output: **(A[l - 1] + (i_initial + 1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + b * 2 + i_initial + 2 (where b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - (i_initial + 1)) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - (i_initial + 1)) * l if r - l >= 0, otherwise b is B[r] + (idx_B[r] - (i_initial + 1)) * l)**
