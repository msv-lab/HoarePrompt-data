You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a 1D grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell, and the character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves. The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem using a two-pass approach, one for cells with '>' and one for cells with '<'. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.

2. **Processing '>' Cells:**
   - It initializes two lists, `A` and `idx_A`.
   - It iterates through the grid from left to right.
   - For each cell with '>', it calculates the number of steps the pinball would take if it started from that cell and only considered '>' cells. The value is stored in `A`, and the index of the cell is stored in `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Cells:**
   - It initializes two lists, `B` and `idx_B`.
   - It iterates through the grid from right to left.
   - For each cell with '<', it calculates the number of steps the pinball would take if it started from that cell and only considered '<' cells. The value is stored in `B`, and the index of the cell is stored in `idx_B`.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - It uses the values from `A` and `B` to calculate the total number of steps for each starting position.
   - The logic for combining these results appears complex and involves several conditional checks and calculations.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided program attempts to efficiently calculate the number of steps using dynamic programming-like techniques. However, there are several issues that suggest the program may not be correct:

1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses complex calculations involving multiple lists and indices, which can be error-prone and difficult to verify.
   - The logic for combining the results from `A` and `B` seems overly complex and may not correctly account for all possible scenarios.

2. **Potential Off-by-One Errors:**
   - The program uses indices and lengths in various calculations, which can lead to off-by-one errors if not handled carefully.
   - The boundary conditions for the grid (i.e., when the pinball leaves the grid) are not clearly handled in the final calculations.

3. **Lack of Simplicity:**
   - A simpler and more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position, which would be easier to verify.
   - The provided program attempts to optimize the solution using pre-calculated values, but the optimization may introduce errors.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the logic and the potential for errors, it is difficult to verify the correctness of the provided program without a thorough and detailed analysis. However, based on the provided code and the complexity of the calculations, it is reasonable to conclude that the program may not be correct.

Correctness: **False**
