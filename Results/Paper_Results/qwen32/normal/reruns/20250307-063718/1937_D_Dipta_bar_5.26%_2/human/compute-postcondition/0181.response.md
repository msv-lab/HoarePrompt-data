To determine what will be printed by the `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Key Information:
1. **`A`**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. **`idx_A`**: A list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
3. **`B`**: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
4. **`idx_B`**: A list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
5. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
6. **`i`**: The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1` before the print statement.
7. **`r`**: The variable `r` is updated to `r - 1` before the print statement.

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(i + 1, end=' ')` will output the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this print statement, the value of `i + 1` will be the current value of `i` plus 2.

However, the exact value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, only that it is incremented by 1 before the print statement. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of the current value of `i`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is the value of the variable `i` before it is incremented by 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the current value of i before it is incremented by 1)**
