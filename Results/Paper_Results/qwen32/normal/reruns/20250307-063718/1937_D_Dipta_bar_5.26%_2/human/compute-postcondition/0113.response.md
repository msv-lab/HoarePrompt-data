Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`; `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters; `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the length of `B` minus 1; `n` is greater than 0; the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'; `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the last element of `B`; `b` is `(b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1))`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
