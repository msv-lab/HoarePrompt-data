The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
