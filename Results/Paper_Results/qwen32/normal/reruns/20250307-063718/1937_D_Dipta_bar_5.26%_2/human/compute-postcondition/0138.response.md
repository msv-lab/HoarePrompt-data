The code snippet provided decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Since the initial value of `r` is not specified, we can only state that it has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1.**
