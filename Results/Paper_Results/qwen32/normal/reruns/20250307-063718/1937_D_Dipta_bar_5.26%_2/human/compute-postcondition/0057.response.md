To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the string `s` and modifies the lists `B` and `idx_B` based on the presence of '<' characters. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior and the final state:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `B` starts as an empty list.
   - `idx_B` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
   - If `s[i] == '<'`, the following actions are performed:
     - `idx_B` appends `i`.
     - If `idx_B` was previously empty, `B` appends `0`.
     - If `idx_B` was not empty, `B` appends a new value calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `idx_B` will contain all indices of '<' characters encountered in the string `s` from right to left.
   - `B` will contain a series of values calculated based on the positions of these '<' characters.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this. Suppose `s = ">>><<>"` and `n = 6`.

- **Iteration 1 (j=0, i=5)**: `s[5]` is '>', so `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
- **Iteration 2 (j=1, i=4)**: `s[4]` is '<', so `idx_B` becomes `[4]` and `B` becomes `[0]`.
- **Iteration 3 (j=2, i=3)**: `s[3]` is '<', so `idx_B` becomes `[4, 3]` and `B` becomes `[0, 1]` (since `0 + (4 - 3) * 1 = 1`).
- **Iteration 4 (j=3, i=2)**: `s[2]` is '>', so `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
- **Iteration 5 (j=4, i=1)**: `s[1]` is '>', so `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
- **Iteration 6 (j=5, i=0)**: `s[0]` is '>', so `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state is:
- `idx_B` contains `[4, 3]`.
- `B` contains `[0, 1]`.

Given the general form of the loop and the behavior described, we can conclude the final output state for any string `s`:

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, and `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.**

In natural language, this means that `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from their initial states, which are based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`. The lists `B` and `idx_B` are populated based on the positions of '<' characters, with `B` containing calculated values that depend on the positions of '<' characters and the order in which they are encountered from right to left.
