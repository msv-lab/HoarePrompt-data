Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list with at least one element and the new element `x` has been appended to it, `idx_A` is not an empty list, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

**Explanation:** The list `A` now has an additional element `x` appended to it. The value of `x` is calculated based on the previous last element of `A` and the indices in `idx_A`. All other variables remain unchanged.
