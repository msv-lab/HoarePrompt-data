Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'.
- `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the last element of `B`.
- `b` is calculated as `(b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1))`.

### Analysis:
Given the conditions, `l` being greater than `r` and `r` being not equal to 0 suggests that there are no '<' characters in the string `s` (since `r` is the length of `B` minus 1 and `B` is a list of indices of '<' characters). However, the condition `l > r` and `r != 0` is contradictory unless `l` and `r` are not being updated as expected or there's an error in the precondition. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume the precondition is correct and proceed with the given values.

- `a` is the last element of `B`. Since `r` is not 0, `B` must have at least one element. Therefore, `a` is the last element of `B`.
- `b` is calculated as `(b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1))`. Here, `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not 0, which means `l` must be at least 1 for this to be valid. Therefore, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element in `idx_A` at index `l - 1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Determining the Output:
- `a` is the last element of `B`.
- `b` is calculated as `(b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1))`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the position in the string `s` which is not '>', so `i` is some integer.

Given the above, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` can be evaluated as follows:
- `a * 2` is twice the last element of `B`.
- `b * 2` is twice the value of `b`.
- `(n - i)` is the difference between `n` and `i`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is the last element of B, b is calculated as (b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)), n is greater than 0, and i is the position in the string s which is not '>')**
