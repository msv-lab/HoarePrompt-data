The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting a specific expression from it. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and conditions.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b = b - (idx\_B[r - l] - i) \times (r - l) \]

Given the initial state:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `r` is `r - 1`.
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the value of `b`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.**
