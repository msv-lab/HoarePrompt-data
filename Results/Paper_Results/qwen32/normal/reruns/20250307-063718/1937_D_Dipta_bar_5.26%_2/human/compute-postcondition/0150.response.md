The code snippet `a = B[r]` assigns the value of the element at index `r` in the list `B` to the variable `a`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r]`.**
