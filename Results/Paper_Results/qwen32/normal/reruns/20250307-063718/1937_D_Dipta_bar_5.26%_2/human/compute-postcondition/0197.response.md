Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `B[r]` if `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0. Otherwise, `a` is `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Here, the value of `b` has been updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
