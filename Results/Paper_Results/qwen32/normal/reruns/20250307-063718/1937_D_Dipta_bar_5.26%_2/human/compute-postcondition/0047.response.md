The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value `n - 2` is added to `idx_B`. 

The other variables (`A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `j`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` now includes an additional `0` at the end. Otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `x`, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`. `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end if `s[i]` is '<'. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is `n - 2`. `idx_B` now includes `n - 2` at the end.**
