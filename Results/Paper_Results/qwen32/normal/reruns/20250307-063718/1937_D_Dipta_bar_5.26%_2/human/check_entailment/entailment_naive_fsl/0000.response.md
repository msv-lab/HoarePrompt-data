Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify some problems:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly integrated**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, but it is not returning the results properly. Instead, it is printing the results directly inside the function.
   - The main loop in the program calls `func_1(s)` but does not capture or print the results correctly.

2. **Incorrect logic for computing the number of seconds**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` seems overly complicated and does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
   - The logic does not properly account for the inversion of characters after each move, which affects the subsequent movements of the pinball.

3. **Lack of proper handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the grid is very small or where the pinball can leave the grid in the first move.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the grid contains only one character.

4. **Potential off-by-one errors**:
   - The program uses indices in a way that might lead to off-by-one errors, especially when calculating the number of seconds and handling the boundaries of the grid.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided program does not produce the correct output for this test case. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed, and the program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.
