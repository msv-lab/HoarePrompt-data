The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are changed by this line of code. The initial state specifies that `A` is a list of integers, `l` is an index (though not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is implied to be a valid index for list `A`), and `b` is being assigned the value at the position `l - 1` in list `A`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
