Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` has been updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, where `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
