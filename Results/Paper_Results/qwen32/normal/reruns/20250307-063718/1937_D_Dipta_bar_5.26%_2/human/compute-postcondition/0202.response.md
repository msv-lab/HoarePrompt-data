To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's first understand the flow and the transformations happening in each iteration based on the provided code and the conditions.

### Loop Overview
- The loop runs `n` times.
- `i` is the loop variable, starting from 0 up to `n-1`.
- `l` is incremented when encountering a '>', and `r` is decremented when encountering a '<'.
- Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, different calculations are performed and printed.

### Initial State
- `A` and `B` are lists of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_A` and `idx_B` are lists of indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to the length of `B`.

### Conditions and Calculations
- If `s[i] == '>'`:
  - `l` is incremented.
  - Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, different calculations are performed for `a` and `b`, and a value is printed.
  
- If `s[i] != '>'` (i.e., `s[i] == '<'`):
  - `r` is decremented.
  - Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, different calculations are performed for `a` and `b`, and a value is printed.

### Final Output State
After the loop has finished executing all `n` iterations, the final state of the variables would be:
- `l` would be equal to the number of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `r` would be equal to the initial length of `B` minus the number of '<' characters encountered.
- The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged as they are only used for calculations and not modified.
- `idx_A` and `idx_B` remain unchanged as they are only used for indexing and not modified.
- The loop variable `i` would be `n`.

### Output State
The output state after the loop has executed all the iterations is:

Output State: **`l` is the number of '>' characters, `r` is the initial length of `B` minus the number of '<' characters, `A` and `B` remain unchanged, `idx_A` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Description
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `l` will reflect the total count of '>' characters encountered in the string `s`. The variable `r` will reflect the initial count of '<' characters minus the number of '<' characters encountered. The lists `A` and `B`, as well as `idx_A` and `idx_B`, will remain unchanged as they are only used for calculations. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that all characters in the string `s` have been processed.
