The code snippet updates the value of `b` based on the current index `i` and the value of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The new value of `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.
