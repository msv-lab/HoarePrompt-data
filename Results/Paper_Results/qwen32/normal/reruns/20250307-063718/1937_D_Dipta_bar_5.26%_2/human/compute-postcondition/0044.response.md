Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the output state based on the initial conditions.

Initial State:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end if `s[i]` is '<'.
- `B` contains the integer 0 if `idx_B` was empty before the operation, otherwise it contains its previous elements plus the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.

The code snippet:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Impact:
- `x` is assigned the value of `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.

Given that `i` is `n - 2`, we substitute `i` in the equation:
- `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end if `s[i]` is '<', `B` contains the integer 0 if `idx_B` was empty before the operation, otherwise it contains its previous elements plus the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`**

In simpler terms, the output state is that all variables remain as they were described in the initial state, except for the newly introduced variable `x`, which is calculated as specified.
