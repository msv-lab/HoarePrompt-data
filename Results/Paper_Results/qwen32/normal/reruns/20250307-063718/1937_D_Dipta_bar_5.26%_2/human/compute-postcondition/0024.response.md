Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`. If `idx_A` was originally empty, `A` has an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `A` has its last element updated to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `x` is set to the same value as the last element of `A`.**
