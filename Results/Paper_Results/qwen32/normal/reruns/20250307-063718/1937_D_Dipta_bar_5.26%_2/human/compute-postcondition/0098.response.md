The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from it. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given preconditions.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`; `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters; `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the length of `B` minus 1; `n` must be greater than 0; the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'; `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is not equal to 0; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`; `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**
