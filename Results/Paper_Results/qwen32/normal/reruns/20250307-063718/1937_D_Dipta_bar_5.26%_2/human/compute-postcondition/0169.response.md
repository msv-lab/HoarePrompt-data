To determine what will be printed by the `print(n - i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in a string `s`.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is being incremented by 1 at some point before this print statement.

However, the exact values of `n` and `i` are not provided. The only information we have is that `i` is incremented by 1 before this print statement.

Given this information, the output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `n - i`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact values of `n` and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - i (where n is a positive integer greater than 0 and i is an integer that has been incremented by 1 before this print statement)**
