To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is decremented by 1.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the value of `i + 1`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is incremented by 1, but we do not have an explicit value for `i` before the increment. However, we can describe the output in terms of the incremented value.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1, followed by a space.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of the variable i after it has been incremented by 1)**
