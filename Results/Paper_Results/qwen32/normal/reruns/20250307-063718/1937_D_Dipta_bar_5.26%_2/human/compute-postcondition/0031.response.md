The value of `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. Given that `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0, `i` becomes `n - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**.
