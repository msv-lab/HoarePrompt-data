Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end. If `idx_B` was empty before this operation, `B` contains the integer 0; otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end, and `B` is updated as follows: if `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` now includes an additional `0` at the end. Otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `x`, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i] == '<'`, then `idx_B` has an additional element `n - 3` appended to it, and `B` is updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`: if `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` has an additional element `0` appended to it; otherwise, `B` has an additional element `x` at the end, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i] != '<'`, there is no change to `idx_B` or `B`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
