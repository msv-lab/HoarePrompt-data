Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is `l + 1`. If `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remained unchanged. Now, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, if `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is `r - 1`. If `l <= r`, then if `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l > r`, then if `r` is 0, no additional changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r]` if `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0, or `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
