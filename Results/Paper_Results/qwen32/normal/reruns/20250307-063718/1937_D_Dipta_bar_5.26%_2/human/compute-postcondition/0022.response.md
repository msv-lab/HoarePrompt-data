The code snippet calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, and `i`. The value of `x` is determined by taking the last element of list `A`, adding to it the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is greater than 0
- `A` is a list
- `idx_A` is a list
- `i` is `i + 1`

The value of `x` will be:
\[ x = A[\text{len}(A) - 1] + (i - \text{idx\_A}[\text{len}(\text{idx\_A}) - 1]) \times \text{len}(\text{idx\_A}) \]

The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the newly calculated value of `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**
