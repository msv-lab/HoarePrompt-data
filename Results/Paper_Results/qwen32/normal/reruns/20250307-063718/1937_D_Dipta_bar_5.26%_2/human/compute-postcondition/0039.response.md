The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1` and `s[i]` is '<'. Therefore, after the execution of `idx_B.append(i)`, `idx_B` will contain the value `n - 1` as its last element.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `n`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `idx_B` was empty, it now contains the integer `n - 1`. Otherwise, `idx_B` now contains its previous elements plus the integer `n - 1` at the end. `B` is a list containing the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i` if `idx_B` was not empty before this operation, or `B` is a list containing the integer 0 if `idx_B` was empty before this operation. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `s[i]` is '<'.**
