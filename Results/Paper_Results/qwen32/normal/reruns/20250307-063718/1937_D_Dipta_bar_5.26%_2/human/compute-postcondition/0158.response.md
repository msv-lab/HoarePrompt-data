Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1. If `l <= r`, then if `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, the function does nothing additional. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
