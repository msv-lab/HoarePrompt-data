Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s`, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list. If the current character `s[i]` is '>', and `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` now contains the element 0. Otherwise, `A` has at least one element and a new element `x` has been appended to it, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. `idx_A` is not empty after the execution and now contains the new element `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', no changes are made to `A` or `idx_A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `A` has a new element appended (`0` if `idx_A` was empty, otherwise `x` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`), and `idx_A` has the new element `i` appended. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `idx_A` is a list with an additional element `i` appended to it, and `x` is set to the same value as the last element of `A`. Otherwise, `idx_A` remains unchanged and `x` is not modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
