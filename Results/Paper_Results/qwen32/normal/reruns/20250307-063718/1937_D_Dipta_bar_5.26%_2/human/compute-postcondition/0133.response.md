The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression used to update `b`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In natural language: The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
