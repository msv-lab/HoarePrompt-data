Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is either '>' or not '>'. If the character at index `i` is '>', then `l` is 1 and `r` remains the length of `B`. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, and `r` is 0, no further action is taken. If `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `((A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`; otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If the character at index `i` is not '>', then `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `l` is not 0, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `a` is the last element of `B` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is set to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decremented by 1. If `l <= r`, if `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is `l + 1`. If `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remained unchanged. Now, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, if `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is `r - 1`. If `l <= r`, then if `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l > r`, then if `r` is 0, no additional changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r]` if `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0, or `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
