The code snippet calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, and `i`. Specifically, `x` is assigned the value of the last element of `B` plus the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `A` is a list of integers (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s` (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2 (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `i` is `n - 3`.

The value of `x` is calculated as:
\[ x = B[\text{len}(B) - 1] + (\text{idx\_B}[\text{len}(B) - 1] - i) * \text{len}(\text{idx\_B}) \]

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

In natural language, after executing the code snippet, the output state is that `x` is calculated based on the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, the value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
