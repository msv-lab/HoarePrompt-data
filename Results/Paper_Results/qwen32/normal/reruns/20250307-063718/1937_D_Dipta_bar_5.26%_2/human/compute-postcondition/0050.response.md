The code snippet provided updates the value of `i` based on the current values of `n` and `j`. Specifically, `i` is recalculated as `n - 1 - j`.

Given the initial state:
- `A` is a list of integers.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

After executing the code snippet `i = n - 1 - j`, the new value of `i` will be `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`.**
