The code snippet appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Therefore, the length of `B` increases by 1, and the last element of `B` is now `x`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s` with `B` now having one additional element `x` at the end, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`**
