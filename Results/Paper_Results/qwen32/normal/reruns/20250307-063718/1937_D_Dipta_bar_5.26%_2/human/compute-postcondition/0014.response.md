The code snippet `A.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `A`. The other variables, `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with a new element `0` appended, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.
