The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is a list.
- `idx_A` is a list.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented again, and it must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to make it clear that `i` is specifically the next index in the loop:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**. 

Since we know `i` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, the start of the next iteration should have `i` as the next index:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.

To explicitly show the increment:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given the context, the most precise way to represent the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To match the format:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.
