Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>'. Additionally, `l` is not less than `r`. If `r` is 0, no further action is taken. If `r` is not 0, `b` is calculated as `((A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Additionally, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**
