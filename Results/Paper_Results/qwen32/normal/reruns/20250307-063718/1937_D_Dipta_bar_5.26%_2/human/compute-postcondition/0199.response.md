Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`. If `r` is 0, no additional changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r]` if `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0, or `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
