The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` now holds the integer value from the list `B` at the index `r - 1`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.

The only change is the introduction of `b` with the value `B[r - 1]`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**
