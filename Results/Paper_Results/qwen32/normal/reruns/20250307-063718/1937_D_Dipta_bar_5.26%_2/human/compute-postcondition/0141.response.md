The code modifies the value of `a` by adding to it the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**
