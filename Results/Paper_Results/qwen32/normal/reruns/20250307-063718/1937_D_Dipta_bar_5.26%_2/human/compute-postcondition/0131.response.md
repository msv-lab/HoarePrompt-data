The code snippet modifies the value of `b`. The initial state of `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. After executing the statement `b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, the new value of `b` is updated.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**.
