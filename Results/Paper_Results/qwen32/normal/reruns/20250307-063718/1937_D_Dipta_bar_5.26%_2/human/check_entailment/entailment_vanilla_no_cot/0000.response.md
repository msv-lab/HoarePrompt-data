Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` as an argument, but it doesn't return any value. The results are printed directly inside the function, which is not ideal for testing or reusability.

2. The approach used in the code seems overly complex and does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the rules provided. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the inversion of the characters in the string `s` after each move of the pinball, which is a crucial part of the problem.

3. The logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is incorrect. The code uses some complex formulas that do not match the problem's requirements.

4. The code does not handle the edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball starts from the leftmost or rightmost cell.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position, keeping track of the number of moves and inverting the characters in the string as specified. A simpler and more straightforward approach would be to use a simulation method, which would be easier to understand and debug.
