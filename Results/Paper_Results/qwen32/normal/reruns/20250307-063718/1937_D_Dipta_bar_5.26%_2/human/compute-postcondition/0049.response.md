The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end, and `B` is updated as follows: if `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` now includes an additional `0` at the end. Otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `x`, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is `n - 2`**
