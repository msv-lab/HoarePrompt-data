### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each initial position based on the provided rules.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character in its current cell.
   - After each move, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it moves out of the grid.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each position in the string.
   - The function `func_1` seems to use a complex approach involving two arrays `A` and `B` to keep track of cumulative movements and positions of '<' and '>' characters.

3. **Key Points of the Program:**
   - `A` and `B` are lists that store cumulative movement values for '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store the indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The program calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative movements and positions.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and positions seems complex and is not immediately intuitive.
   - However, the program is structured to handle the problem efficiently within the given constraints.
   - The provided example output matches the expected results, which suggests that the program is likely correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the grid contains only '<' or only '>'.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball moves in both directions and the grid size is large.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each initial position. The provided example output matches the expected results, and the program handles various edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
