Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - r - 2] - A[l - r - 2]`**

Natural Language: The value of `b` has been updated to the result of `b - A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
