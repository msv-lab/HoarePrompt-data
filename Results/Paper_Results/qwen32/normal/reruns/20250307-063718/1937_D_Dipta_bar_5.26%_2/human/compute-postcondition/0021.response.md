The code snippet `A.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `A`. The other variables `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with an additional element `0` at the end, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`.**
