To determine what will be printed by the statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **A** is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. **idx_A** is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
3. **B** is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
4. **idx_B** is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
5. **n** is greater than 0.
6. **i** is `i + 1`.
7. **a** is `A[l]`.
8. **x** is `r - (l + 2)`.
9. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remained unchanged.
10. Now, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:
- **a * 2**: This is twice the value of `a`, where `a` is `A[l]`.
- **b * 2**: This is twice the value of `b`, where `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- **i + 1**: This is the value of `i` incremented by 1.

### Combining the Values
The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` can be described as follows:
- `a * 2`: Twice the value of the element at index `l` in the list `A`.
- `b * 2`: Twice the value of the calculated `b` which is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- `i + 1`: The value of `i` incremented by 1.

### Final Output
The output will be the result of the above expression. Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) + i + 1**
