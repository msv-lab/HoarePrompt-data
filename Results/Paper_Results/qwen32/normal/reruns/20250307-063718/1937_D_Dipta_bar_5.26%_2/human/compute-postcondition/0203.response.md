Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the state of the grid for a single test case. The length of `s` is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns an integer representing the number of valid pairs of '<' and '>' in the string `s`.**
