Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` and `B` are updated based on the presence of '<' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `B` has an additional element `x` at the end, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`.**
