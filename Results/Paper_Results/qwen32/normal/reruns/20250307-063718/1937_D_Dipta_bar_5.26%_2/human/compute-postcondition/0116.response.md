Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `l` is not 0, and `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `a` is the last element of `B` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0.**
