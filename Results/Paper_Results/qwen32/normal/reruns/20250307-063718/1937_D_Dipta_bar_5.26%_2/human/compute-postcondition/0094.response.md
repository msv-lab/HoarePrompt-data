Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is not equal to 0; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `a` has been updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. All other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and the character at position `i` in the string `s`) remain unchanged.
