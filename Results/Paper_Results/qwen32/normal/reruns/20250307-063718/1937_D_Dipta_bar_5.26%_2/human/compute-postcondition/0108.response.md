Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'.
- `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the last element of `B`.

Code Snippet:
```python
b = A[l - 1]
```

From the code, `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. Given that `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, which means `b` is assigned the value of the last element of `A`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`; `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters; `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the length of `B` minus 1; `n` is greater than 0; the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'; `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the last element of `B`; `b` is the last element of `A`.**
