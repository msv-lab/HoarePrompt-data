Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`. If `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
