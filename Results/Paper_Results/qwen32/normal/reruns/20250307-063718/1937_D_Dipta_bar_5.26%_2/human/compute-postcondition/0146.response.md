Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
