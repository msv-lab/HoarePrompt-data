Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`.**

The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is decreased by 1.
