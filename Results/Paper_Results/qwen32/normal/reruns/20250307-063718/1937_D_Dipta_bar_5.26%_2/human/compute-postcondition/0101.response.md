Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
3. `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
4. `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
5. `l` is 0.
6. `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
7. `n` is greater than 0.
8. The character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'.
9. `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is not equal to 0.
10. `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
11. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine `a`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Given `l` is not 0, `A[l - 1]` is a value from the list `A` at index `l - 1`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the current position in the string `s` which is not a '>' character.

2. **Determine `b`:**
   - `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - `B[r]` is the value from the list `B` at index `r`.
   - `B[r - l]` is the value from the list `B` at index `r - l`.
   - `idx_B[r - l]` is the index of the `r-l`-th '<' character in the string `s`.
   - `idx_B[r]` is the index of the `r`-th '<' character in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the current position in the string `s` which is not a '>' character.
   - `l` and `r` are used to calculate the indices and values in the formula.

3. **Calculate the Output:**
   - The print statement calculates `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - This involves doubling the values of `a` and `b`, adding `i + 1`, and printing the result.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a value calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`, the current position `i`, and the indices `l` and `r`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is calculated as A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is calculated as B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, with i being the current position in the string `s` which is not a '>' character, and l and r are indices based on the lengths of lists A and B respectively)**
