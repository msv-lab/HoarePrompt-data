Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is not equal to 0, then `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
