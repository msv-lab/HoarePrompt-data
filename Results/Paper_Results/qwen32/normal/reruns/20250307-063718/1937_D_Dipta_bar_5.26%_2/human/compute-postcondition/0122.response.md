Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the result of subtracting `B[x]` from its previous value `B[r - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
