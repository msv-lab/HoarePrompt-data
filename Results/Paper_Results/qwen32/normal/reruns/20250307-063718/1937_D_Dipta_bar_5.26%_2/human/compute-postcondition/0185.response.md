The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `b` was initially `B[r]`.
- After the operation, `b` becomes `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

Other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, `a`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**
