The code snippet `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means `idx_A` will have an additional element, which is the current value of `i`. Other variables like `s`, `n`, `A`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list with an additional element `i` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` is set to the same value as the last element of `A`.**
