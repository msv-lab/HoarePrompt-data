To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` at the point where the print statement is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `A` and `B` are lists of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are lists of indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement.
   - `r` is decremented by 1 before the print statement.
   - `a` is calculated based on the condition `l - r - 1`:
     - If `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0, `a` is `B[r]`.
     - Otherwise, `a` is `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
   - `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`.

### Calculate the Output:

Given the complexity and the fact that specific values for `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, and `l` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

- `a` is either `B[r]` or `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` based on the condition `l - r - 1`.
- `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

The output of the print statement will be:
\[ \text{Output: } (a \times 2 + b \times 2 + (n - i)) \]

Where:
- `a` is calculated based on the condition `l - r - 1`.
- `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

Given the state, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` will be evaluated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n`.

### Final Output:

Output: **(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)) (where a is B[r] if l - r - 1 is not greater than 0, otherwise a is -(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1), b is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), i is incremented by 1, and n is a positive integer)**
