Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

In natural language, the output state means that the variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `a` retain their previous values. The new variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`.
