Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `B[r]`.**
