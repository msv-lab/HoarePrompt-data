The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `b` based on the expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. This assignment overrides any previous value `b` might have had, including the conditional assignment mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the updated output state considering the new assignment to `b`:

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remained unchanged. Now, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.**

In simpler terms, the new value of `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
