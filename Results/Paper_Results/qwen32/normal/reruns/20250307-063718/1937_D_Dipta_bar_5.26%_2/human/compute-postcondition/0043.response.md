The code snippet `B.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `B`. This operation does not affect any other variables or their values.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end. If `idx_B` was empty before this operation, `B` contains the integer 0; otherwise, `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `idx_B[len(idx_B) - 1] - i`. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged. Additionally, `B` now includes an additional `0` at the end.**
