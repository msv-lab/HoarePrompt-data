The code snippet `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Therefore, the value of `B` will now include the newly added element `x` at the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` contains the integer `n - 1` at the end if `s[i]` is '<', `B` contains its previous elements plus the value `x`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`**.
