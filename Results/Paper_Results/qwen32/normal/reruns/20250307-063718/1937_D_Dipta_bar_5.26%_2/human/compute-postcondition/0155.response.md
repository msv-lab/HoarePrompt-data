Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `b` has been updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial states.
