To determine what will be printed by the `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided conditions.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **String `s`**: The string `s` contains characters, and the positions of '>' and '<' characters are important.
2. **Lists `A` and `B`**: 
   - `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
3. **Lists `idx_A` and `idx_B`**: 
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s`.
4. **Variables `l` and `r`**: 
   - `l` is initialized to 0.
   - `r` is initialized to the length of `B` minus 1.
5. **Variable `i`**: The problem states that the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'.
6. **Condition**: `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`. This means it will print the value of `i + 1` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.
- The exact value of `i` is not given directly, but we know that `s[i]` is not '>'.
- Since `i` is not specified, we can't determine its exact value from the given information. However, the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the most precise description we can provide for the output is that it will print `i + 1`, where `i` is an index in the string `s` such that `s[i]` is not '>', and it is followed by a space.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is an index in the string s such that s[i] is not '>')**
