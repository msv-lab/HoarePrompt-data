Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list. If the current character `s[i]` is '>', and `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` now contains the element 0. Otherwise, `A` has at least one element and a new element `x` has been appended to it, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. `idx_A` is not empty after the execution and now contains the new element `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', no changes are made to `A` or `idx_A`.**
