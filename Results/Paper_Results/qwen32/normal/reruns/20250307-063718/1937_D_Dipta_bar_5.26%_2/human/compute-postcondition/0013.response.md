The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we can denote as `i_end`), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the previous state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is greater than 0
- `A` is a list
- `idx_A` is a list
- If the current character `s[i]` is '>', and `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` now contains the element 0. Otherwise, `A` has at least one element and a new element `x` has been appended to it, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- `idx_A` is not empty after the execution and now contains the new element `i`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, and `idx_A` do not need to be adjusted as per the loop head.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_end + 1`. However, if we assume `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then the new value of `i` would be `i_end + 1`.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**.
