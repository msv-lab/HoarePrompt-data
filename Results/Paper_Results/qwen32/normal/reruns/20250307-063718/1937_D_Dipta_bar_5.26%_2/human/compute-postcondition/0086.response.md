Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>'. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[0]` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, no further action is taken. If `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `((A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

Natural Language: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and calculations for `a` and `b` are still valid based on the new value of `l`.
