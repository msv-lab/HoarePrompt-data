Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its previous value `A[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial states.
