The code snippet `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the end of the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, `i`, and the expression for `x` remain unchanged except for the list `A` which now includes the newly appended value `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with the last element being `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

In simpler terms, the list `A` now has an additional element at the end, which is the value of `x` calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
