The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that `idx_A` now has one more element, which is the value of `i` after the increment operation. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with a new element appended (`0` if `idx_A` was empty, otherwise `x` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`), `idx_A` is a list with the new element `i` appended, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
