Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in a string `s`.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1.
- `r` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is an integer greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: This is an integer that has been incremented by 1. So, `i` is at least 1.
3. **`idx_A[l - 1]`**: This refers to the last element in the list `idx_A` (assuming `l` is the length of `idx_A`). `idx_A` contains the indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.

### Expression Breakdown:
- `n - i`: This part of the expression is simply the difference between `n` and `i`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This part calculates the difference between `i` and the last index of '>' characters in `s`, and then multiplies it by 2.

### Output Calculation:
The output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

### Final Output Description:
The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, where `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index of '>' characters in the string `s`.

Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is an integer greater than 0, i is an integer incremented by 1, and idx_A[l - 1] is the last index of '>' characters in the string s)**
