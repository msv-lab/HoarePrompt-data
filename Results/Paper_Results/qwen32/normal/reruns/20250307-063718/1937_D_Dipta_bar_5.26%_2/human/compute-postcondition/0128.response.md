The code snippet calculates the value of `a` using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. The variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i` are given in the initial state, but `r` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `r` is a valid index within the bounds of `B` and `idx_B`, we proceed with the calculation.

The value of `a` is now calculated and assigned, but the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**
