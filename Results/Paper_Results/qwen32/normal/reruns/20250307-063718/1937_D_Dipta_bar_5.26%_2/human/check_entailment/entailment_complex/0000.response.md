Reasoning:

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by precomputing certain values based on the positions of the '<' and '>' characters in the string. It then uses these precomputed values to determine the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` appears to be incorrect. The calculations and conditions inside the function do not correctly reflect the rules of the problem. Specifically, the way the values in `A` and `B` are computed and used to determine the output does not align with the movement rules of the pinball and the inversion of characters.

The correct approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of characters, and counting the number of steps until the pinball exits the grid. This simulation would need to be done for each test case and each starting position within that test case.

Given the complexity and the need for accurate simulation of the pinball's movement, the provided program's logic is insufficient and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
