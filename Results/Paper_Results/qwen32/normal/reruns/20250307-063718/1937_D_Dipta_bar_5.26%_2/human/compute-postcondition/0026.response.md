Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `idx_A` is a list with an additional element `i` appended to it, and `x` is set to the same value as the last element of `A`. Otherwise, `idx_A` remains unchanged and `x` is not modified.**
