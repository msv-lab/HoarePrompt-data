Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `A` has a new element appended (`0` if `idx_A` was empty, otherwise `x` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`), and `idx_A` has the new element `i` appended. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.**
