To determine the new value of `b`, we apply the given operation directly to the previous value of `b`. The equation provided is:

```
b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `b` is `A[l - r - 2] - A[l - r - 2]` which simplifies to `0` (since any value minus itself is 0).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
```
b = 0 - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
```

Therefore, the new value of `b` is:
```
b = -(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
```

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `-(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.
