The code snippet `x = r - (l + 2)` calculates the value of `x` based on the current values of `r` and `l`. Given the initial state, `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `B`. Therefore, the value of `x` will be `r - (0 + 2)`, which simplifies to `r - 2`.

The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged by this operation. The only variable that changes is `x`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`.**
