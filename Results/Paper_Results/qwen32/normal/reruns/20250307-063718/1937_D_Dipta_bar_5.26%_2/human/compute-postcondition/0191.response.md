To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and their roles**:
   - `A`: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in a string `s`.
   - `idx_A`: A list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `B`: A list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `idx_B`: A list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `i`: An integer that is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `r`: An integer that is decremented by 1 (`r = r - 1`).
   - `l`: Presumably an integer representing some index, possibly related to the length of `idx_A` or some other list.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `n - i`: This part of the expression subtracts the current value of `i` from `n`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This part calculates the difference between `i` and the `l-1`th index in `idx_A`, then multiplies the result by 2.

### Detailed Explanation:

- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so its value is one more than its previous value.
- `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' characters are found in the string `s`.
- `l` is an integer that is presumably used to index into `idx_A`. The expression `idx_A[l - 1]` retrieves the index of the `l-1`th '>' character in the string `s`.

### Output Calculation:

The output of the print statement is:
\[ n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 \]

- `n - i` directly depends on the values of `n` and `i`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` depends on the value of `i` and the index of the `l-1`th '>' character in the string `s`.

### Final Output Description:

The value printed will be the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Since the exact values of `n`, `i`, `l`, and `idx_A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, the print statement will output the result of this expression.

Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is an integer greater than 0, i is an integer incremented by 1, l is an integer used to index into idx_A, and idx_A[l - 1] is the index of the (l-1)th '>' character in the string s)**
