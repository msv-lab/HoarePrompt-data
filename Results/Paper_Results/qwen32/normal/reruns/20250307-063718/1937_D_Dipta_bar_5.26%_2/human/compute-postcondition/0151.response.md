Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

In this output state, the variable `b` has been assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`, where `l` must be a predefined variable indicating an index in the list `A`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
