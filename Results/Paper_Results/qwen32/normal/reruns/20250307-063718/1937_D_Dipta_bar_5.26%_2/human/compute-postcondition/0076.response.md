The code snippet calculates the value of `a` using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Given the initial state, we can determine the new value of `a` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- `a` is newly assigned the value `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `B[r - 1]` is the last element of list `B`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last element of list `idx_B`.
- `i` is the current index where the character in string `s` is '>'.
- `r` is the length of list `B`.

Other variables like `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>'. Additionally, `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**
