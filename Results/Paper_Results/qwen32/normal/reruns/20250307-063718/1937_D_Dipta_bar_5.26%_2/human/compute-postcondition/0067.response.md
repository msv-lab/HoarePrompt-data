The code snippet `b = b - B[x]` modifies the value of `b` by subtracting the value of `B[x]` from it. Here, `b` is initially `B[r - 1]` and `x` is `r - 2`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2]`.**

In simpler terms, `b` is now the result of subtracting the element at index `r - 2` of list `B` from the element at index `r - 1` of list `B`. All other variables retain their initial values.
