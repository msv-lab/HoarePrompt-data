Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list, `idx_A` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated based on the last element of `A`, the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the new value assigned to `x`.
