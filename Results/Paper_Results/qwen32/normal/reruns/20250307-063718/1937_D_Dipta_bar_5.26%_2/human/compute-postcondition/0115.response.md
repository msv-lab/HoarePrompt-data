Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is greater than `r`. If `r` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the last element of `B` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
