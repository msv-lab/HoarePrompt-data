To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string `s`.
   - `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l]`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is calculated as `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - `b` is now `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The `print` statement evaluates `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` and prints it.

3. **Step-by-Step Evaluation:**
   - `a` is the value of `A[l]`.
   - `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `i + 1`.
   - The expression to evaluate is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` where `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` and `i` is `i + 1`.

Given the variables and their dependencies, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is the value of A[l], b is (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and i is incremented by 1)**

This provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
