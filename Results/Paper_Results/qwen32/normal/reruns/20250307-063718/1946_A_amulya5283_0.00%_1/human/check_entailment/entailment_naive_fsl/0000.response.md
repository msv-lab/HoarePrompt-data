Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description because it only increases the smallest element in the right half of the sorted array until the smallest element in that half is greater than the current median. This approach does not necessarily minimize the number of operations required to increase the median.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 1
```

The current median is `2`. To increase the median, we need to make sure that the new median is greater than `2`. The new median should be the 3rd element in the sorted array. One way to achieve this with the minimum number of operations is to increase the two `1`s to `2`s, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The new median is `2`, which is not greater than the original median. However, if we increase one of the `1`s to `3`, we get `[3, 2, 2, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, and after sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` or `[1, 2, 2, 3, 2]` respectively, and the new median is `2`. To ensure the median is strictly greater, we need to increase one more `2` to `3`, resulting in the array `[3, 2, 3, 2, 1]` or `[1, 3, 2, 2, 3]` or any permutation that results in a sorted array like `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. The new median is `3`, which is greater than the original median. This requires a total of `2` operations.

However, the provided code will only increase the smallest element in the right half of the sorted array until it is greater than the current median. In this case, it will increase one of the `1`s to `2`, resulting in `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, and then it will increase the other `1` to `2`, resulting in `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The new median is `2`, which is not greater than the original median. To make the median greater, it will need to increase one more `2` to `3`, resulting in a total of `3` operations, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code does not always find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
