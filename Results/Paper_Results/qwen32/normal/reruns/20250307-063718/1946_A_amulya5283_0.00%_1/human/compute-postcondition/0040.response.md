The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median:`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to the `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed.
- `operations` is 2.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0]` (the smallest element in the heap) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with modifications, and `heap[0]` is the smallest element in this heap, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's assume `heap[0]` is currently greater than `current_median`. To make the loop execute one more time, we can adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed, where `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`**.
