The code snippet assigns the variable `heap` to be the slice of the list `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`
- `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`

The variable `heap` is now assigned the value of `arr[median_index:]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**
