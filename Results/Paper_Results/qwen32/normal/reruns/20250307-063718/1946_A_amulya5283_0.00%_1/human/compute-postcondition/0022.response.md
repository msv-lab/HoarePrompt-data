The code snippet provided appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given this, the `results` list, which was initially empty, will now contain the value of `operations`. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the loop terminates.**
