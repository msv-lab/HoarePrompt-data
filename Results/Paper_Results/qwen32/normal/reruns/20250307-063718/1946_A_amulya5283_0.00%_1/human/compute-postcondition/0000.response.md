Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables (`t` and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.
