#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for each test case; `i` is equal to `t` (indicating all iterations have completed); `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` are not defined outside the loop body as they are local variables.
    return results
    #The program returns the list 'results' which contains the value of 'operations' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the list is greater than the median of the list, and returns a list of these operation counts for all test cases.
