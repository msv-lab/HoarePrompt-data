The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `operations` is 1.
- `smallest` is such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

After executing `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`:
- The smallest element in `heap` is removed and assigned to `smallest`.

The value of `heap` will change as it loses its smallest element. The value of `smallest` will be updated to the smallest element that was previously in `heap`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`.**
