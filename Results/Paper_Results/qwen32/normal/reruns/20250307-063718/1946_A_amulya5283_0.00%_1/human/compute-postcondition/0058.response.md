To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
- `current_median` is the median of the array `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

2. **Adjusting `heap[0]`**:
   - `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

3. **Adjusting `current_median`**:
   - `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, the median of the array `arr`.
   - We can adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]` to ensure the condition holds.

### Conclusion:
- We need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
- Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap and `current_median` is the median of the array, we can adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`.

### State Adjustment:
- We can adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]` to ensure the loop condition holds.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**

This ensures that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
