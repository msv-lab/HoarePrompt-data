The code snippet `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place. This means that the elements in `heap` will be rearranged to satisfy the heap property, but the elements themselves remain the same.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.
- `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.

After executing `heapq.heapify(heap)`, the `heap` variable will be a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.**
