The code snippet calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. This value is then assigned to the variable `median_index`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
