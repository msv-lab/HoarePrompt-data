The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to `current_median`. Since `median_index` is defined as `n // 2`, `current_median` will be the value at the middle index of the sorted list `arr`. 

Given the initial state, `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`. Therefore, `current_median` will be the middle element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**
