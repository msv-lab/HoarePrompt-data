The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. This operation will maintain the heap property of the `heap` list.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, and now the smallest element in `heap` is the new `smallest`. After executing `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`, the heap will include the value `smallest + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged since the code snippet only affects the `heap`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `smallest + 1` added, and `smallest + 1` pushed into the heap; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**
