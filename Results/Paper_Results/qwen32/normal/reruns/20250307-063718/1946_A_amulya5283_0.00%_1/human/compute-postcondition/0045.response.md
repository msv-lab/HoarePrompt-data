Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the loop exits; `smallest` is not defined outside the loop body as it is a local variable.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values.
