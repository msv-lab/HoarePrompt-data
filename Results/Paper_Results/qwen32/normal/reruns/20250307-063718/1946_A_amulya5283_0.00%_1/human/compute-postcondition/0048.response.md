The code snippet sorts the list `arr`. Therefore, the list `arr` will be in non-decreasing order after the `sort()` method is called. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
