The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `heap`. This will affect the `heap` by removing the smallest element, and `smallest` will be assigned this value.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`. After `heapq.heappop(heap)`, `heap` will be restructured to maintain the heap property, and `smallest` will hold the smallest element that was at the root of the heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed; `operations` is 0; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of `heap`.**
