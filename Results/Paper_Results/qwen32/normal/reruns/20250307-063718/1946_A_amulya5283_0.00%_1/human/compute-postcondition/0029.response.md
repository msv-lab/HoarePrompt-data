The code snippet `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place. This means that `heap` will satisfy the heap property, where for every element at index `i`, the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the elements at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` (children in a binary tree representation).

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The only change is to the `heap` variable, which is now a heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.**
