The code snippet calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The value of `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `median_index` will be the integer division result of `n` by 2.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
