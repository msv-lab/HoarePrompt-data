The code snippet assigns `heap` to be the sublist of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end of `arr`. 

Given that `median_index` is `n // 2`, `heap` will contain the second half of the sorted list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**
