The code snippet assigns the `i`-th tuple from `test_cases` to `n` and `arr`. This means `n` will take the first element of the `i`-th tuple, and `arr` will take the second element (which is a list).

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` now points to the next tuple in the `test_cases` list compared to its previous state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.**
