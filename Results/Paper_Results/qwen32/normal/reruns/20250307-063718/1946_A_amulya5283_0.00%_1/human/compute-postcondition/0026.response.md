The code snippet calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The value of `n` is derived from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `median_index`, which is newly calculated.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
