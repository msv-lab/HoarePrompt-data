Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here are the issues:

1. **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with the second half of the sorted array (`arr[median_index:]`). This is incorrect because the median is the middle element(s) of the sorted array, and we need to consider elements around the median to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase it.

2. **Median Calculation**: The median is calculated as `arr[median_index]`, which is correct for odd-sized arrays. However, for even-sized arrays, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The problem statement defines the median as the element at index `ceil(n/2)` in the sorted array, which is correct for both odd and even-sized arrays.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program attempts to increase the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This approach is flawed because it does not take into account the effect of increasing one element on the overall sorted order of the array. The correct approach would involve considering the elements around the median and determining the minimum number of increments needed to ensure that the median increases.

4. **Handling Even-sized Arrays**: The program does not handle even-sized arrays correctly. For even-sized arrays, the median is the element at index `ceil(n/2)`, and we need to ensure that this element is greater than the current median.

To fix these issues, the program would need to:

- Sort the array and identify the median.
- Use a min-heap to efficiently find and increase the smallest elements around the median.
- Handle both odd and even-sized arrays correctly by ensuring that the median increases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        heap = arr[:median_index + 1]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version should handle both odd and even-sized arrays correctly and determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. However, it still needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure correctness.
