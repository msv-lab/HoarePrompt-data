The code snippet `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now contain one more element, which is the value of `operations` at the time of execution.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the newly appended value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed to ensure all elements in `heap` are greater than `current_median`.**
