The code snippet provided removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation affects the heap and the value of `smallest`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the push operation and `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**.

In natural language: The smallest element from the heap has been removed and assigned to the variable `smallest`. The heap now no longer contains this smallest element, and all other variables retain their previous values.
