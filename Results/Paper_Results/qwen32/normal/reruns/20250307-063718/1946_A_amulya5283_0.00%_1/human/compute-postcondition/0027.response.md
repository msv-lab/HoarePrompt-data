The code snippet assigns the value of the element at the `median_index` in the sorted list `arr` to the variable `current_median`. The value of `median_index` is `n // 2`, where `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`.

Since `arr` is already sorted, the element at `median_index` is the median of the list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of `current_median`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**
