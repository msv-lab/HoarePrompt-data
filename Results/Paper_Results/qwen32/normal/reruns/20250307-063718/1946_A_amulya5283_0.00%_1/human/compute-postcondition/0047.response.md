The code snippet assigns the `i`-th tuple from `test_cases` to `n` and `arr`. This means `n` will hold the first element of the `i`-th tuple, and `arr` will hold the second element (which is a list of integers).

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, and `results` remains a list containing the value of `operations`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`**.
