The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap, which is `heap[0]`. This operation modifies the `heap` by removing its smallest element and re-heapifying the remaining elements.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. After executing the code, `smallest` is assigned the value of `heap[0]` before it is removed from the heap. The `heap` will now contain all the previous elements of `heap` except the smallest one, and it will still maintain the heap property.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed; `operations` is 0; `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**
