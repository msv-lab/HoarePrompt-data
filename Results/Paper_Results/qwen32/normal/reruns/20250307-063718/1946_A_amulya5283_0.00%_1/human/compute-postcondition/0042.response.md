The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the `heap`. This means the `heap` will now contain an additional element, which is `smallest + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed, where `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`; `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.**
