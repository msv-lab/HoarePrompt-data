Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`; `operations` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `operations` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as no other changes have been made to them by the provided code snippet.
