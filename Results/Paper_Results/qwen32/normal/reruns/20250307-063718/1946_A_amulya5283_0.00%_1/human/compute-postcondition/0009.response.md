To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Key Variables**: The loop condition depends on `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop will execute if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`.
- `operations` is 0.

To satisfy the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `heap` (which is `heap[0]` after heapifying) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` is constructed from `arr[median_index:]`, and `arr` is sorted, `heap[0]` will be the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`. For the loop to execute, this smallest element must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

In the worst case, if `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, we need to adjust the list `arr` such that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Adjustment:
- Ensure that `arr[median_index:]` contains at least one element that is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `arr` is sorted, `current_median` is the middle element (or the lower of the two middle elements if `n` is even). Therefore, to ensure `heap[0] <= current_median`, we can adjust `arr` such that the element at `median_index` or any element after it is equal to `current_median`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`; `operations` is 0**

This ensures that `heap[0]` (the smallest element in `heap`) is equal to `current_median`, satisfying the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` and allowing the loop to execute.
