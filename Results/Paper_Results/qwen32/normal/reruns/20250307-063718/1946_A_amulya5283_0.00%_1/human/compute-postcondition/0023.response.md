The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current iteration number, and `t` is the total number of iterations to be performed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the loop terminates; `i` is the next iteration number, so `i` is incremented by 1.**
