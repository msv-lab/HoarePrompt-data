For the given task, the for loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `test_cases` and `results` are not directly part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states to make the loop execute. However, we need to ensure that `t` is set in a way that allows the loop to run.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. Since `t` is already described as a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, this condition is already satisfied. No adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute.
4. The states of `test_cases` and `results` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute, given the constraints provided.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a, `results` is an empty list**
