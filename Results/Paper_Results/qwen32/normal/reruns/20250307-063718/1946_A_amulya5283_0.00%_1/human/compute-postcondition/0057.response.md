Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**

Explanation: The value of `operations` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables retain their previous values as the code snippet only modifies `operations`.
