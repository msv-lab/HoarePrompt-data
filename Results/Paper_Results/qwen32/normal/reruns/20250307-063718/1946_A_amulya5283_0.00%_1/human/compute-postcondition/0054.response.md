The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]` and `current_median`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `heap[0] <= current_median` for the loop to execute. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.
2. `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.
3. `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` (i.e., `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the median element of `arr` (i.e., `current_median`).

Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, the smallest element in `heap` is `heap[0]`. For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. 

Given that `arr` is sorted, `current_median` is the middle element of `arr`. To ensure `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to make sure that at least one element in `arr[median_index:]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `arr` is sorted, `arr[median_index]` is the first element in `arr[median_index:]`, which is also `heap[0]` in the heap. To ensure the loop executes, `arr[median_index]` (or `heap[0]`) should be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed if `arr` is already sorted and `heap` is correctly heapified. However, to ensure the loop executes, we can state that `heap[0]` (which is `arr[median_index]`) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`; `operations` is 0**
