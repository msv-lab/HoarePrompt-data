To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0] <= current_median` remains true. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues if `heap[0] <= current_median`.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: 
   - Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`.
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

   To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

4. **Adjust `smallest` or `current_median`**: 
   - One way to ensure this condition is to adjust `smallest` so that `smallest + 1` is still less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Alternatively, we can adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

Given the information, let's adjust `smallest` such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`**

This ensures that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` remains true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
