The code snippet `n, arr = test_cases[i]` assigns the first element of the `i`-th tuple in the `test_cases` list to the variable `n` and the second element (which is a list) to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `results` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The variable `results` is an empty list.

After executing the code snippet, `n` will hold the integer from the `i`-th tuple, and `arr` will hold the list of integers from the same tuple. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we will consider it as a given index within the bounds of `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
