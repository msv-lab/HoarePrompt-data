Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the loop terminates.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the state is such that all elements in the `heap` are greater than the `current_median`. The `heap` no longer contains any elements that are less than or equal to the `current_median`, which means the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates. The `operations` variable holds the total count of how many times the loop body was executed, which is the total number of increments performed on the smallest elements of the heap to make them greater than the `current_median`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not modified within the loop.
