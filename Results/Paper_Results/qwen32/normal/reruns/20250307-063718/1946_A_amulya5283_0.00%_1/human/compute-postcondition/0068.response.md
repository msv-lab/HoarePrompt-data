Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for each test case; `i` is equal to `t` (indicating all iterations have completed); `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` are not defined outside the loop body as they are local variables.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the total number of operations required for each test case to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median. The loop index `i` will have reached the value of `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` will no longer be defined outside the loop since they are local to each iteration.
