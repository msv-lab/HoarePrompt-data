The code snippet provided initializes the variable `operations` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `operations` while keeping all other variables in their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`; `operations` is 0.**
