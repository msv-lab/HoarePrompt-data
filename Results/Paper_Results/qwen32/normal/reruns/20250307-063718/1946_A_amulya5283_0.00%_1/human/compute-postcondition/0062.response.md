To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `heap[0] <= current_median`. We need to ensure that after modifying the state, this condition remains true.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added.
- `operations` is 2.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.
- The `heap` now includes the value `smallest + 1`.

The loop condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that after the modifications, `heap[0]` is still less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`, the smallest element in the heap is currently `smallest + 1`. To ensure the loop condition holds, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

Therefore, `current_median` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`. The `heap` now includes the value `smallest + 1`.**
