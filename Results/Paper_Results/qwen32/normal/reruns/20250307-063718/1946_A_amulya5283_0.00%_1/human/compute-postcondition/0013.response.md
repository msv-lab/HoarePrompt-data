The loop condition in the provided `while` statement is `heap[0] <= current_median`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the smallest element in `heap` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `heap[0]` and `current_median` such that `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the element `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, which is the median of the current `arr`.

To satisfy the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap` and `heap` includes `smallest + 1`, we need to make sure that `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the element `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the push operation and `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
