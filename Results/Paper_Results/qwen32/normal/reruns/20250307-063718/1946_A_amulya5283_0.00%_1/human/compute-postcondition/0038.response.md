The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap, which means the heap now includes this new value while maintaining the heap property. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`.**
