You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the list is greater than the median of the list, and returns a list of these operation counts for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to separate the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
   - The arrays are stored as tuples of their length and the array itself in a list called `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the array is sorted.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2` (integer division).
   - The current median is the element at this index in the sorted array.

3. **Using a Min-Heap:**
   - A min-heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array.
   - This heap is used to efficiently get the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the current median.
   - The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly removes the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - The number of operations (increments) is counted and stored for each test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is printed.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Median Calculation:**
  - The median is correctly identified as the element at the `n // 2` index in the sorted array.
  
- **Min-Heap Usage:**
  - The min-heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that are less than or equal to the current median.
  - This ensures that the minimum number of increments is used to make the median larger.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles arrays of different lengths, including arrays of length 1.
  - It also correctly handles cases where all elements are the same or where the median is already the largest possible value.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It efficiently handles the input constraints and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
