To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. This means that the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) should be less than or equal to the `current_median`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is `smallest + 1`.
   - `current_median` is the median of the array `arr`.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

4. **Adjustments needed**:
   - Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.
   - Therefore, `smallest` must be adjusted such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

Given the current state, we need to adjust `smallest` to ensure the condition holds true. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `operations`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

**State**: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 1; `smallest` must be such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`**

This ensures that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
