The code sorts the list `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged. The list `arr` is now in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
