The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes a new value into the heap, which is the smallest element in the heap plus one. This operation modifies the `heap` variable by adding the new value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 0; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of `heap`.**

In natural language: The `heap` now includes an additional element, which is `smallest + 1`, where `smallest` was the smallest element in the heap before the push operation. All other variables retain their previous values.
