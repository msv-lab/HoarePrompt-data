The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place, which means the list `heap` will now satisfy the heap property. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, or `current_median`. The only change is in the structure of the `heap` list, which is now a heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`.**
