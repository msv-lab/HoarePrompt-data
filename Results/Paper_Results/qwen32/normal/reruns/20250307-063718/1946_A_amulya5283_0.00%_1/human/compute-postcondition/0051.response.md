The code snippet assigns the `heap` variable the value of the sublist of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, `heap` will contain the second half of the sorted list `arr`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `median_index` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the `heap` variable, which is a sublist of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**
