To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. This condition must be true for the loop to continue executing.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the smallest element in `heap` (`heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's analyze the current state and the necessary adjustments:

1. **heap[0]**: This is the smallest element in the heap after the push operation. According to the problem statement, `heap` includes `smallest + 1`, and this value must be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to continue.

2. **current_median**: This is the median of the array `arr` at index `median_index`.

Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `smallest + 1 <= current_median`. This implies that `smallest` must be less than `current_median`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`. Since `smallest` is the smallest element in the heap before the push operation, it must be adjusted to a value that satisfies this condition.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`. This means `smallest` should be less than `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the i-th tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr[median_index]` is equal to `current_median`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the push operation and `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**.
