To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the `current_median`. Each iteration pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap, while also incrementing the `operations` counter.

Here's the final output state described in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the loop exits; `smallest` is not defined outside the loop body as it is a local variable.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the `current_median`. At this point, the `heap` will contain only elements that are greater than the `current_median`, and `operations` will hold the total count of how many increments were performed to achieve this state.
