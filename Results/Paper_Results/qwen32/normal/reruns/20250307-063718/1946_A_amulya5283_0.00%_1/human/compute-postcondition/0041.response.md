The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap. This means the variable `smallest` will take the value of the smallest element that was previously in `heap`.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed, where `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`. After executing `heapq.heappop(heap)`, the `smallest` variable will hold the value of the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the `i`-th tuple of `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element of the previous `heap` is removed, where `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was previously in `heap`**.
