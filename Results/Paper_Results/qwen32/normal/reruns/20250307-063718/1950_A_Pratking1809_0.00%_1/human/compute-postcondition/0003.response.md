The code snippet takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` must be greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 0**.

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged.
