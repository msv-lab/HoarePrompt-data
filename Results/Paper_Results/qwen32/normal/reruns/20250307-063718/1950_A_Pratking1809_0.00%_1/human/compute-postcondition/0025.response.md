Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 2. No changes are made to the variables regardless of whether `a < b > c` is true or false.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, indicating that none of the variables are altered by the condition or the absence of an else block.
