Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input in the last iteration; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is equal to `q` - 1.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was initially.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are those from the last input provided to the loop.
- The value of `q` remains unchanged from its initial value, indicating the total number of iterations.
- The value of `mn` stays at 100.
- The loop counter `i` will be equal to `q - 1`, reflecting that the loop has completed all `q` iterations.
