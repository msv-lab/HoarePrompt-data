The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. 

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the input, they will be updated to the specific integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 2**
