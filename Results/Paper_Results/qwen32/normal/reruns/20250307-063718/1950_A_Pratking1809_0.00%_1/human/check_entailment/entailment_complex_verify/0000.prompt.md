You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input in the last iteration; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is equal to `q` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect due to improper handling of the "NONE" condition. Specifically, the `else` statement is incorrectly placed in such a way that it will print "NONE" whenever the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not true, which includes cases where the first condition (`a < b < c`) is also not true. This means that if `a < b < c` is true, the program will correctly print "STAIR", but if `a < b > c` is not true, it will print "NONE" even if `a < b < c` is also not true, leading to incorrect results for cases that should be "NONE" but are not checked properly.

To fix this, the `else` statement should be replaced with an `elif` statement to properly check for the "NONE" condition only when neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This ensures that "NONE" is only printed when neither the "STAIR" nor the "PEAK" conditions are met.
