Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 1. The condition `a < b > c` does not affect the values of the variables. If `a < b < c`, this condition holds true but does not change the values of the variables. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes that the if-else block does not alter the values of the variables regardless of the condition `a < b > c` or `a < b < c`.
