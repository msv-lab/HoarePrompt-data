Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, or `i`. `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 0.**
