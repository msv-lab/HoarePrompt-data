You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input in the last iteration; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is equal to `q` - 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
4. Next, it checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a logical error in the program. The `else` statement is incorrectly placed after the second `if` statement. This means that if the first `if` statement (checking for "STAIR") is true, the program will not check the second `if` statement (checking for "PEAK"). Instead, it will directly print "NONE". This will result in incorrect output for cases where the digits form a peak.

The correct structure should be to use `elif` for the second condition so that it is only checked if the first condition is false.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Since the given program does not have this correction, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
