Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied but no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
