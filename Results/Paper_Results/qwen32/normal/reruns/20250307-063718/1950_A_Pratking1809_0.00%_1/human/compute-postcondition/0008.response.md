The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

The string `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement. This means that the output of the `print` statement will be exactly the string `'PEAK'`, regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
