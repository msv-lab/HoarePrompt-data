The code snippet assigns the value `100` to the variable `mn`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100.**
