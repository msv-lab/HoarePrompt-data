Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `mn` is 100.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied but no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'NONE'` without any regard to the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, or `i`. The condition `a < b < c` does not affect the execution of the print statement because the print statement is not inside any conditional block that depends on this condition. Therefore, the output will always be `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or any other variables.

### Output:
Output: **NONE**
