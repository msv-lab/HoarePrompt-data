The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, and `i`) and their properties or constraints. However, the `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'PEAK'` directly. It does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, or `i`. The condition `a < b < c` is mentioned but does not affect the execution of the `print` statement, as it is not used within the statement.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
