Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    if a < b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, or `i`. `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 1. The condition `a < b > c` does not affect the values of the variables. If `a < b < c`, this condition holds true but does not change the values of the variables. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 2. No changes are made to the variables regardless of whether `a < b > c` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
