Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect due to improper handling of the "NONE" condition. Specifically, the `else` statement is incorrectly placed in such a way that it will print "NONE" whenever the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not true, which includes cases where the first condition (`a < b < c`) is also not true. This means that if `a < b < c` is true, the program will correctly print "STAIR", but if `a < b > c` is not true, it will print "NONE" even if `a < b < c` is also not true, leading to incorrect results for cases that should be "NONE" but are not checked properly.

To fix this, the `else` statement should be replaced with an `elif` statement to properly check for the "NONE" condition only when neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This ensures that "NONE" is only printed when neither the "STAIR" nor the "PEAK" conditions are met.
