The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('PEAK')`. This statement will print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, and `i`. The condition `if a < b < c` does not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is outside the scope of any conditional block. Therefore, the string 'PEAK' will always be printed.

Output: **PEAK**
