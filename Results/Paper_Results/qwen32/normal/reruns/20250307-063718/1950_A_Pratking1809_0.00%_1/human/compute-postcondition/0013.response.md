The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This operation overwrites the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the new input values. The other variables `t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while the values of `t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i` stay the same as they were initially.
