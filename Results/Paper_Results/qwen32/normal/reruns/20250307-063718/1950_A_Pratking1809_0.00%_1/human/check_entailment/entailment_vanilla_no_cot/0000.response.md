Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical error in the else clause. The current implementation prints "NONE" whenever the second condition (a < b > c) is not met, which includes the case when the first condition (a < b < c) is true. This results in "NONE" being printed instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair. 

To fix the issue, the else clause should only be executed when neither of the first two conditions is met. This can be achieved by using elif for the second condition. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.
