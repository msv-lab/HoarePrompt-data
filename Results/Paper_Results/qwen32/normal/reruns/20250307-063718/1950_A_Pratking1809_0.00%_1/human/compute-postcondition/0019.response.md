The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is greater than 0; `mn` is 100; `i` is 2**
