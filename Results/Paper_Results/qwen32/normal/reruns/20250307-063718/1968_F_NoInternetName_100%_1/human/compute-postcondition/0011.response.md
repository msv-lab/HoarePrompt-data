The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the iteration variable that takes on each value in the list `a` one by one. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty.
- `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
- `x` is `[0, i, 0]`.
- `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`.
- `i` is the next element in the list `a`.

Since `i` is the current element being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `a`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `inds`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.** 

However, to be more precise, we should denote that `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `i`. Assuming the current `i` has already been processed, the next `i` would be the subsequent element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `i`.**

Since we are not given the specific current `i` or the position of `i` in the list `a`, we can denote the next `i` simply as the next element in `a`:

State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
