The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships but does not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, or `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The `print('Yes')` statement is a simple output command that prints the string `'Yes'`.
2. The variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` are described in the initial state but do not influence the content of the `print` statement.
3. Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables, the output will always be the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
