Postcondition: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, `i` is `i_old + 1`. If `upper > lower`, the condition for the if block is met; otherwise, the else block is executed. In both cases, the variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` retain their defined states as per the precondition.**
