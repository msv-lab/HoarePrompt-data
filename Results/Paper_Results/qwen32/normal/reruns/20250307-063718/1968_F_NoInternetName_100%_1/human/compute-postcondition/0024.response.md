Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `x` Construction**:
   - `x` is constructed as `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`.
   - `x` starts with `0` and is followed by the cumulative XOR values from the list `a`.

2. **Dictionary `inds`**:
   - `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
   - This means `inds` will have keys as the unique cumulative XOR values and values as lists of indices where these values appear in `x`.

3. **Variables `a`, `n`, `q`**:
   - These remain unchanged and are not directly involved in the `print` statement.

4. **Variables `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - The exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided but are used in the subsequent logic.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` is given.
   - If this condition is true, it means the cumulative XOR values at indices `l - 1` and `r` in `x` are the same.

6. **Variables `lower` and `upper`**:
   - `lower` is determined from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is determined from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`.
   - Additionally, `upper` is greater than `lower`.

### Analysis of the `print` Statement:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `x`, `inds`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`. The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` and the subsequent logic about `lower` and `upper` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Conclusion:

The output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables or the results of any functions. It will always print `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
