Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that can convert strings to a specified data type, such as int or float.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the function 'cast' to each element of the list created by splitting the input string. Each element of the input string is converted to the data type specified by the 'cast' function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a conversion function `cast` as an argument, reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, applies the `cast` function to each substring, and returns a map object containing the converted values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and predicate is a function that takes a single element from arr and returns a boolean value. The function func_2 performs a binary search to find the largest index l such that predicate(arr[l]) is True.
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` is `l + 1`.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns `l`, which is the largest index such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` is `l + 1`. Additionally, `predicate(arr[l])` is `False`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `arr` and a `predicate` function as inputs. It searches for the largest index `l` in `arr` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If such an index exists, it returns `l`; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes a list as an argument.
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of `func_2(arr, predicate)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the result of applying the predicate function to the list `arr`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value.
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program returns the value of `result` plus 1, where `result` is the value returned by `func_2(arr, predicate)` and is not None.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value, `result` is the value returned by `func_2(arr, predicate)`, and `result` is None
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the value returned by `func_2(arr, predicate)` incremented by 1, if `func_2` does not return None. Otherwise, it returns None.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_5():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]

    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a], `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `i` is `q`. The variables `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)` from the last iteration, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, and `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true as determined by `func_3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on an array of integers. For each query, defined by a range [l, r], it determines if there exists a subarray within [l, r] such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. It outputs "Yes" if such a subarray exists, otherwise "No".
