The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program other than skipping the current loop iteration. Therefore, the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, `i` is `i_old + 2`**.
