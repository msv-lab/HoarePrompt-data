The code snippet provided is `n, q = func_1(int)`. This line suggests that the function `func_1` is called with `int` as an argument, and it returns two values which are then assigned to `n` and `q`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `q` returned by this function. 

Given the initial state and the nature of the function call, we can infer that `n` and `q` will be replaced by whatever values `func_1` returns. Since the function and its return values are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `q` will be updated to new values, but we cannot specify what those values are.

Other variables like `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
