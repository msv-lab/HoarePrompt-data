Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Values:** The program attempts to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values by checking the indices of XOR values in the `inds` dictionary. However, it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if such a split is possible.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:** The `func_2` and `func_3` functions are binary search implementations, but they are not correctly used in the context of finding the appropriate indices for the XOR values. The `func_4` function also does not correctly handle the case where the `func_2` function returns `None`.

3. **Logic for Checking Subarray:** The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is flawed. The program checks if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero and then attempts to find indices in the `inds` dictionary that match the XOR values, but it does not correctly determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where the subarray cannot be split into more than one part with equal XOR values.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to implement a more robust approach to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. This might involve using a different data structure or algorithm to efficiently check the conditions for each query.

Here is a possible correct approach:

1. **Precompute XOR Prefixes:** Compute the XOR of all prefixes of the array.
2. **Check Subarray XOR:** For each query, check the XOR of the subarray and determine if it is possible to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.

Here is a possible implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = func_1(int)
        a = list(func_1(int))
        x = [0]
        for i in a:
            x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = func_1(int)
            subarray_xor = x[r] ^ x[l - 1]
            if subarray_xor == 0:
                print('Yes')
                continue
            count = 0
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                if x[i] ^ x[l - 1] == subarray_xor:
                    count += 1
            if count > 1:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')

main()
```

This implementation correctly checks if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values by counting the number of times the required XOR value appears in the subarray. If it appears more than once, the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
