The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` modifies the list `inds` by appending the index of the last element of `x` to the sublist of `inds` indexed by the last element of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty.
- `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
- `x` is `[0, i, 0]`.
- `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1]`.
- `i` is the next element in the list `a`.

The code modifies `inds[x[-1]]` by appending `len(x) - 1`, which is `2` (since `x` has 3 elements and `len(x) - 1` is `2`).

Let's consider the two possible cases for `i`:
1. If `i` is `0`, then `inds[0]` is initially `[0, 1]`. After the code executes, `inds[0]` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.
2. If `i` is not `0`, then `inds[i]` is initially `[1]`. After the code executes, `inds[i]` becomes `[1, 2]`.

Since `x[-1]` is `0` in both cases (the last element of `x` is always `0`), the sublist `inds[0]` is the one that gets modified.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
