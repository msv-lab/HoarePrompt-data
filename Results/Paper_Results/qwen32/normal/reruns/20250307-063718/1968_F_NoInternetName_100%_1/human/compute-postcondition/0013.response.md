The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Given the initial state, `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`, so `x[-1]` is `i`. Therefore, the element `len(x) - 1` which is `3` (since `len(x) = 4`), is appended to `inds[i]`.

If `i` is `0`, `inds[0]` is initially `[0, 1, 2]`, and after appending `3`, it becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

If `i` is not `0`, `inds[i]` is initially `[1, 2]`, and after appending `3`, it becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.

The values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
