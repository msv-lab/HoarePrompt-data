The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it will take in the loop. Given that `i` is currently `i_old + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 again.

Here are the steps:

1. **Current state of `i`:** `i` is `i_old + 1` after the previous iteration.
2. **Next state of `i`:** Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `(i_old + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `i_old + 2`.

The other variables (`x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, `i` is `i_old + 2`**
