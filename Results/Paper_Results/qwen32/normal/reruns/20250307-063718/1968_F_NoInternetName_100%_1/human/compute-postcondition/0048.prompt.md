Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a], `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`. `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists. `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, `i` is `i_old + 1`. If `upper > lower`, the condition for the if block is met; otherwise, the else block is executed. In both cases, the variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` retain their defined states as per the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true as determined by `func_3`, `i` is `i_old + 2`. Regardless of whether `upper > lower` or not, the variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` maintain their respective states as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
