The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` with a list as the default factory. This means that `inds` is now a dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty list if the key does not exist. The values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
