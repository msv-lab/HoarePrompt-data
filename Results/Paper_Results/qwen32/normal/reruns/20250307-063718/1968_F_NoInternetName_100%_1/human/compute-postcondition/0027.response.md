Postcondition: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`. `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists. `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**
