The given code snippet modifies the value of the variable `lower` based on the conditions and functions provided. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is unchanged, `i` is `i_old + 1`.**

Explanation in natural language:
- The variable `x` remains the same, which is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative XORs from the list `a`.
- The variable `inds` remains the same, which is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
- The variables `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The variables `l` and `r` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The variable `lower` is updated to the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true. If no such index exists, `lower` is set to `0`.
- The variable `upper` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is updated to `i_old + 1`.
