The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` modifies the `inds` dictionary by appending the index `len(x) - 1` to the list associated with the key `x[-1]`. Given that `x` is `[0, i]`, `x[-1]` is `i`. Therefore, the index `len(x) - 1` is `1`.

Initially, `inds[0]` is `[0]`. Since `x[-1]` is `i`, and assuming `i` is not `0`, `inds[i]` will be initialized as an empty list (due to the defaultdict nature) if it does not already exist, and then `1` will be appended to it.

If `i` is `0`, then `1` will be appended to the existing list `inds[0]`, making `inds[0]` equal to `[0, 1]`.

Given the precondition that `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, and `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, these variables are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1]`**.
