The code snippet provided appends a new element to the list `x`. The new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the current value of `i`. Since `x` was initially `[0, i]`, the last element of `x` before the operation is `i`. Therefore, the new element appended to `x` is `i ^ i`, which is `0` because any number XORed with itself results in `0`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:
- `a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty.
- `n` and `q` remain the integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` remain integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
- `x` is now `[0, i, 0]` because the last element `i` is XORed with itself, resulting in `0`.
- `inds[0]` remains `[0, 1]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` remains `[1]`.
- `i` remains the next element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
