### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to see if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. For each query, we need to determine whether the subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r` is interesting.

#### Code Overview:
The code is structured to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array and a number of queries. For each query, it checks if the subarray is interesting.

1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads input values and converts them to a specified type (typically integers in this context). This function is used to read the number of test cases, the array elements, and the query ranges.
2. **Function `func_2`**: A binary search function that finds the largest index `l` in an array `arr` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. This function is used to find indices within a list that satisfy a certain condition.
3. **Function `func_3`**: Calls `func_2` with the same arguments. This function is redundant and can be removed without affecting the functionality.
4. **Function `func_4`**: Similar to `func_2`, but the result is incremented by 1 if it is not `None`. This function is used to adjust the index returned by `func_2` to be 1-based.
5. **Function `func_5`**: Handles each test case. It computes the cumulative XOR of the array and uses a dictionary to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero, which would imply that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

#### Analysis of `func_5`:
- **Cumulative XOR Calculation**: The array `x` is constructed where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the input array `a`. This allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l-1], ..., a[r-1]` as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.
- **Dictionary `inds`**: This dictionary stores lists of indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding indices where the cumulative XOR is the same, which is necessary for determining if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
- **Query Processing**: For each query `[l, r]`, the code checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`, which means the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If not, it uses the dictionary to find indices where the cumulative XOR values match and checks if there is a valid subarray within the range `[l, r]`.

### Correctness:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR by leveraging cumulative XOR and binary search. The use of the dictionary `inds` to store indices of cumulative XOR values ensures efficient query processing.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
