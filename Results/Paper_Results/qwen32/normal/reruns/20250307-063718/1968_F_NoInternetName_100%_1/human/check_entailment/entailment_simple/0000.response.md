### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the provided problem description.

1. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative XOR of the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`. This is done by iterating over the array `a` and computing the XOR of the elements up to the current index. This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the formula `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to map each unique cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where that value appears in the `x` list. This mapping is used to efficiently determine if there are indices between `l` and `r` that have the same cumulative XOR value.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program first checks if the cumulative XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is zero (`x[l-1] == x[r]`). If it is, then the subarray can be trivially divided into two or more parts with the same XOR value (each part being a single element if necessary), and the program outputs "Yes".
   - If the cumulative XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search (via `func_2` and `func_3`) to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary to determine if there is a valid split. Specifically, it finds the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a valid split, and the program outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting by leveraging cumulative XOR values and binary search for efficient query handling. It correctly handles the edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
