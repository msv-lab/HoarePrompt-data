The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The precondition provides a detailed description of the state of the program, including the variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper`. However, the `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Here is the breakdown of the given information:
- `x` is a list constructed by concatenating `[0]` with a sequence of cumulative XORs from `a`.
- `inds` is a dictionary that maps each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
- `a`, `n`, and `q` are mentioned but remain unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
- The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is checked, and if true, it implies that `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` are equal.
- `lower` is determined based on the indices in `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true.
- `upper` is determined based on the indices in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, and it is also stated that `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

Despite these details, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
