To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. Here is the provided code snippet:

```
upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
```

Let's break down the code and see how it affects the variables:

1. `inds[x[l - 1]]` retrieves the list of indices in `x` where the value `x[l - 1]` appears.
2. `func_3` is called with two arguments: the list of indices `inds[x[l - 1]]` and a lambda function `lambda arg: arg <= r`. The lambda function checks if an index `arg` is less than or equal to `r`.
3. `func_3` returns an index from the list of indices where the condition `arg <= r` holds true. This index is then used to access the value in `inds[x[l - 1]]`, which is assigned to `upper`.

Given the initial state and the description of the variables, the value of `upper` will be the index from the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`.

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`. `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists. `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`.**
