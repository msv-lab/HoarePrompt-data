Postcondition: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.**
