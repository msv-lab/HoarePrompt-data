The code snippet `a = list(func_1(int))` updates the list `a` to the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The initial state specifies that `a` was a list of `n` integers, but this is overwritten by the new values returned by `func_1(int)`. The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.

Given that the function `func_1(int)` returns a list and two integers, we can deduce that `a` is now the list returned by `func_1(int)`, and `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by the same function. The constraints on `l` and `r` remain the same, i.e., `1 <= l < r <= n`, but now `n` is updated to the value returned by `func_1(int)`.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.**
