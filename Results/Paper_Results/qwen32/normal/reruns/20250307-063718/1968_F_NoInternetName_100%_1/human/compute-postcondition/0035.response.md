The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state and the variables described in the precondition do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, or `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state affect the output of this `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
