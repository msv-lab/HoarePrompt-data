The code snippet `inds[0].append(0)` modifies the `inds` defaultdict by appending the integer `0` to the list associated with the key `0`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**

In simple terms, the list associated with the key `0` in the `inds` defaultdict now contains the single element `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
