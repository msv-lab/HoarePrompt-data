The code snippet provided is:

```python
l, r = func_1(int)
```

This line of code updates the values of `l` and `r` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. The specific values of `l` and `r` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the integer argument passed to it. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only state that `l` and `r` will be the values returned by `func_1`.

The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, `i` is `i_old + 2`**.
