The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The precondition describes a series of variables and their relationships, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i`, as it only outputs the literal string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
