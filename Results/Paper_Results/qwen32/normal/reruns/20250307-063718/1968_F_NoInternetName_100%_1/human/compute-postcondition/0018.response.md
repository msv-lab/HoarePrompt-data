To determine what will be printed when the `print('Yes')` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis

1. **List `x`**:
   - `x` is constructed as `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`.
   - The cumulative XOR sequence is derived from the list `a`, but the exact values of `a` are not specified.
   - `x` starts with `0` and is followed by the cumulative XOR values from `a`.

2. **Dictionary `inds`**:
   - `inds` maps each unique cumulative XOR value in `x` to the list of indices where that value appears.
   - This dictionary is built based on the cumulative XOR values in `x`.

3. **Variables `a`, `n`, and `q`**:
   - These variables remain unchanged throughout the process, but their specific values are not provided.

4. **Variables `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
   - The exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, but it is mentioned that the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.

### Code Snippet

The code snippet is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Explanation

The `print('Yes')` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. The condition or calculation leading to this print statement is not provided in the code snippet, but based on the given information, the output is straightforward.

### Final Output

Output: **Yes**
