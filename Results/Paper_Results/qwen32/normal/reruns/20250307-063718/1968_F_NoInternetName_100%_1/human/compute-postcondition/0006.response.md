The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` modifies the list `x` by appending a new element which is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given the initial state, `x` is `[0]`, so `x[-1]` is `0`. The new element appended to `x` will be `0 ^ i`, which simplifies to `i`.

Since `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, we can't determine its specific value. However, we can describe the resulting state in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `inds[0]` is `[0]`**

In natural language: The list `x` now contains two elements `[0, i]`, where `i` is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` (which was `0`) and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
