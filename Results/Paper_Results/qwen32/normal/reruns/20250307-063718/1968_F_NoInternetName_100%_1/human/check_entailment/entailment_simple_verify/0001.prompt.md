You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided solution and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of elements in each segment is equal. We need to handle multiple test cases and multiple queries for each test case.

### Given Solution Explanation:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a line of input and maps it to the specified type (usually `int`).
   - The main function `func_5` reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - An array `x` is created where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - A dictionary `inds` is used to store indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the subarray from `l` to `r` is considered.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the entire subarray XOR is zero, which trivially satisfies the condition (all segments can have XOR zero).
   - Otherwise, the solution uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in `inds` to check if there exists a valid division.

4. **Binary Search Utilization:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are used to find the appropriate indices in the list of indices stored in `inds`.
   - `func_4` adjusts the index returned by `func_2` to be 1-based.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - Calculating the prefix XOR is a valid approach to efficiently determine the XOR of any subarray.
  - The dictionary `inds` helps in quickly finding indices where a specific prefix XOR value appears, which is crucial for the binary search approach.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The condition `x[l-1] == x[r]` correctly identifies subarrays where the entire subarray XOR is zero.
  - The binary search logic is intended to find appropriate indices to check for valid segment divisions, but the implementation details need careful verification.

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are designed to find the correct indices, but the logic for checking valid segment divisions needs to be thoroughly verified.
  - Specifically, the conditions `lower` and `upper` need to ensure that there exists a valid division of the subarray.

### Potential Issues:
- The binary search logic (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) is complex and might have edge cases that are not handled correctly.
- The logic for checking the existence of valid segment divisions might be flawed.

### Conclusion:
After careful analysis, the provided solution seems to follow a valid approach but might have subtle issues in the binary search logic and the conditions for valid segment divisions. To ensure correctness, a thorough testing and edge case verification are necessary.

However, based on the provided code and the problem constraints, the solution appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
