To determine the new state after the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to break down the operations and how they affect the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
```

### Analysis:
1. **`inds[x[r]]`**: This retrieves the list of indices in `x` where the cumulative XOR value `x[r]` appears.
2. **`func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)`**: This function call is expected to find the index in the list `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true. If no such index is found, `or 0` ensures that `0` is used instead.
3. **`inds[x[r]][...]`**: Using the index obtained from the previous step, this fetches the specific index from the list `inds[x[r]]`.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`lower`**: This variable is assigned the value of the index from `inds[x[r]]` that meets the condition `arg < l`. If no such index exists, `0` is used.

### Output State:
Since the specific values of `x[r]`, `inds[x[r]]`, `l`, and the behavior of `func_4` are not provided, we can only describe the updated state in terms of the operations performed.

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`. `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists.**

In simpler terms, the variable `lower` has been updated to hold an index from the list `inds[x[r]]` based on the condition `arg < l`, or `0` if no such index is found. All other variables remain unchanged.
