The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

Let's analyze the given state and the loop:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken the value of the last element of the list `a` that was processed.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to process.

Since `a` is not empty and `i` has taken the value of the last element processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next element in the list `a`. However, since we don't know the specific values in the list `a`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in `a`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element.

State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
