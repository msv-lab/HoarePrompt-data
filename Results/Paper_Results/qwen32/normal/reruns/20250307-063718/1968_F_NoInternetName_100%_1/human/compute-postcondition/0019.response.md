Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a]`, `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified and no return statements are encountered, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
