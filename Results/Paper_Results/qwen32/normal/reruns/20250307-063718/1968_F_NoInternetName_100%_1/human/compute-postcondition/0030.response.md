To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

The initial state describes several variables and their relationships:
- `x` is a list that starts with `0` and is followed by a sequence of cumulative XORs from `a`.
- `inds` is a dictionary that maps each unique cumulative XOR value in `x` to the list of indices where that value appears.
- `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` implies that the cumulative XOR values at indices `l - 1` and `r` are the same.
- `lower` is the index from `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds true, or `0` if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds true, as determined by `func_3`.
- If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`; otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
- `i` is `i_old + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state. Therefore, the output does not depend on the values of `x`, `inds`, `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, or `i`.

Output: **Yes**
