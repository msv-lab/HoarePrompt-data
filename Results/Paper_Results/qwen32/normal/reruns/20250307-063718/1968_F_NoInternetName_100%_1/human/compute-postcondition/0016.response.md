To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
l, r = func_1(int)
```

This line of code suggests that a function `func_1` is called with an integer argument, and it returns two values which are then assigned to `l` and `r`. However, the specific implementation and return values of `func_1` are not provided in the initial state or the code snippet.

Given the initial state, the variables `a`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `q` remain unchanged except for `l` and `r` which are reassigned. The variables `x` and `inds` are also unchanged in terms of their definitions, but their values might be indirectly affected if `func_1` uses them in some way.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the specific new values of `l` and `r`. However, we can state that `l` and `r` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`x` is `[0] + [cumulative_xor for cumulative_xor in the sequence of cumulative XORs from a], `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `a`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, `l` and `r` are now the values returned by `func_1(int)`**.
