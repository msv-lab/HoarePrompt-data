The code appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Given that `x` initially is `[0, i, 0]`, `x[-1]` refers to the last element of `x`, which is `0`. Therefore, the expression `x[-1] ^ i` simplifies to `0 ^ i`, which is equal to `i` because XORing any number with 0 results in the number itself.

Thus, after the operation, `x` becomes `[0, i, 0, i]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `inds`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must not be empty, `n` and `q` are the two integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`, `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `i` is `0`, otherwise `inds[i]` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
