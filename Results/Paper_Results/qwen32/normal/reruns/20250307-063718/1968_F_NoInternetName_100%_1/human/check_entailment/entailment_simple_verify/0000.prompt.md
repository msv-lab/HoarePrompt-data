You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program is intended to determine whether a subarray can be divided into multiple parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. However, there is a critical issue in the logic of the program that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

The main issue lies in the way the program checks for the existence of valid segments within the subarray. Specifically, the program relies on the `inds` dictionary to find indices where the cumulative XOR values match, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cumulative XOR values repeat in a way that does not allow for a valid partition.

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5 1
1 2 3 2 1
1 5
```

The correct answer for this query should be "YES" because the subarray [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] can be divided into [1, 2, 3] and [2, 1] with XOR values 0 and 0 respectively.

However, the provided program will incorrectly output "NO" for this case because it does not correctly identify the valid partition. The cumulative XOR values for the array are [0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0], and the program does not correctly handle the repeated 0 values to identify the valid partition.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:

- The cumulative XOR values for the array are [0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0].
- The program checks if `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, which is true in this case (0 == 0).
- However, it then attempts to find valid indices using the `inds` dictionary, which contains indices for each cumulative XOR value.
- The program uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find the range of indices where the cumulative XOR values match, but these functions do not correctly handle the repeated 0 values to identify the valid partition.

To fix this issue, the program needs a more robust method to identify valid partitions based on the cumulative XOR values. The current logic does not correctly handle all cases where the cumulative XOR values repeat in a way that allows for a valid partition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correctness is False.
