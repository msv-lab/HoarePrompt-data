Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least 1 element, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` and the value is 1, `num` is the first element of `a`.**

The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
