The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is an empty string, after executing this line, `s` will contain the character `chr(j)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. The value of `i` is described as `i + 1` such that `i < t`, but since `i` is not directly modified in the provided code, it remains as `i + 1` with the same condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer such that `k` >= 0, `s` is `chr(j)`, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`.**
