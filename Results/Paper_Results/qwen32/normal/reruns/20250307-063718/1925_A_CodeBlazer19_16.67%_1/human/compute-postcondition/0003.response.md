The code snippet provided initializes an empty string variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` along with the new state of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is an empty string.**
