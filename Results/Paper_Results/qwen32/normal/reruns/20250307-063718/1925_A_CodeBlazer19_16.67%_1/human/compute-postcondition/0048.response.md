Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet, repeated a number of times based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `k` is 1, it prints `n` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, it prints the string of the first `k` letters, repeated either once or twice depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1.**
