You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: The output state is a concatenation of the printed strings for each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, if `k` is 1, `n` repetitions of the character 'a' are printed. Otherwise, `(2 - (n == 1))` repetitions of the string `s` (which consists of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet) are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet, repeated a number of times based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `k` is 1, it prints `n` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, it prints the string of the first `k` letters, repeated either once or twice depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program simply constructs a string using the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeats it, which is insufficient to ensure all subsequences of length `n` are present.

Let's analyze the program with the given examples:

1. For the input `1 2`:
   - The program outputs `ab`, which is correct because the only subsequences of length 1 are `a` and `b`, both of which are present.

2. For the input `2 1`:
   - The program outputs `aa`, which is correct because the only subsequence of length 2 is `aa`, which is present.

3. For the input `2 2`:
   - The program outputs `baab`, which is incorrect. The required string should contain all subsequences of length 2: `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`. The string `baab` does not contain `bb` as a subsequence.

4. For the input `2 3`:
   - The program outputs `abcbac`, which is incorrect. The required string should contain all subsequences of length 2: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`. The string `abcbac` does not contain `aa`, `bb`, or `cc` as subsequences.

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in multiple cases, making it incorrect.
