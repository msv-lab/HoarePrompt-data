Postcondition: **`k` is equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`, and `i` is equal to `t`. Given that `k` is 1, `s` consists of `t` repetitions of the character 'a'.**
