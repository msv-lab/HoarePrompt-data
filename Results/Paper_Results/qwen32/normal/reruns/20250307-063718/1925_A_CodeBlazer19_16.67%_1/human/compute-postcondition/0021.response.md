The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was used to determine `s` as `chr(j)`, and `i` was incremented such that `i < t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `k + 97`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer such that `k` >= 0, `s` is `chr(j + 1)`, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`, `j` is `j + 1` such that `j` < `k + 97`**
