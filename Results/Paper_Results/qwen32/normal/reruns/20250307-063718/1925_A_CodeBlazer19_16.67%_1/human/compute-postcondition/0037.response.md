Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `chr(j)`, `j` is `j + 1`, `s` is updated to include an additional character `chr(j)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 676 inclusive, `n` and `k` retain their input values with `k` still being greater than 0, `i` remains equal to `t - 1`, `s` now includes an additional character which is `chr(j)`, and `j` is incremented by 1.
