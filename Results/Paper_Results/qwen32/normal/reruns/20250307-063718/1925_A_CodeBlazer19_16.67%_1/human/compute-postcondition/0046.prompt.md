Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, and s is a string containing the first k letters of the English alphabet. If k equals 1, then s contains only the first letter of the English alphabet. Otherwise, k is not equal to 1 and s contains the first k letters of the English alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is equal to `t`. If `k` is equal to 1, then `s` consists of `t` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, and `s` is a string that includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` equals 1, `s` specifically includes the first lowercase letter of the alphabet. Otherwise, `s` includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
