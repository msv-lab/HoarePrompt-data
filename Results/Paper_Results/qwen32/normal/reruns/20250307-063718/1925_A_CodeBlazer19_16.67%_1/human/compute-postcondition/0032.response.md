The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state does not include the values of `n` and `k`, as they are being read from the input.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `i` is equal to `t - 1`. If `k` is equal to 1, then `s` consists of `t` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`**

In simpler terms, the variables `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, while `t`, `i`, and `s` remain as described in the initial state, dependent on the values of `t` and `k`.
