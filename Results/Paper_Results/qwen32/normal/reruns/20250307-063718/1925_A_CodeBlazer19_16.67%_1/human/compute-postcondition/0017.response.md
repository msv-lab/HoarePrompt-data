The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input, replacing their previous values. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the English alphabet, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`.** 

In simpler terms, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while the values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
