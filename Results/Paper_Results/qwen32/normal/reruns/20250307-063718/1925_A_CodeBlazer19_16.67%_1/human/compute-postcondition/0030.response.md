Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is equal to `t`. If `k` is equal to 1, then `s` consists of `t` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`.**
