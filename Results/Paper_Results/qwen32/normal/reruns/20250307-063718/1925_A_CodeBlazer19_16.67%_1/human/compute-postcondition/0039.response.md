The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. This means `s` will now include the previous characters it had, plus the new character `chr(j)`.

Given the initial state where `s` already includes the character `chr(j)`, after executing `s += chr(j)`, `s` will now include the character `chr(j)` twice.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `chr(j)` twice, `j` is `j + 1`**.
