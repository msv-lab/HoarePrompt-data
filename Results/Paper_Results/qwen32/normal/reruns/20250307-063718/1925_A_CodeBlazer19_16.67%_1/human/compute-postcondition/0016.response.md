The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some integer such that 1 <= `i` <= 676, and `t` is also an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the English alphabet, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`**
