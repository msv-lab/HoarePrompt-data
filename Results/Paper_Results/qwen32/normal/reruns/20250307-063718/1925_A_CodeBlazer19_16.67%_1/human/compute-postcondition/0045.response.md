Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, and `s` is a string that includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` equals 1, `s` specifically includes the first lowercase letter of the alphabet. Otherwise, `s` includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.**
