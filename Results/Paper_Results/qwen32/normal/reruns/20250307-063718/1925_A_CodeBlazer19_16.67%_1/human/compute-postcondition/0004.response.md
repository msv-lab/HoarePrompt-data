The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`. The loop will execute if the range `range(97, k + 97)` is non-empty. This means that `k + 97` must be greater than `97`, which simplifies to `k > 0`.

Given that `k` is the second integer from the input, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `s` is an empty string**
