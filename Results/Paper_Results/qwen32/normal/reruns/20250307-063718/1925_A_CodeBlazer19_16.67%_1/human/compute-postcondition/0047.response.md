Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 676`. The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of `n` and `k`, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
