To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676.
2. **Variable `n`:** The first integer from the input.
3. **Variable `k`:** The second integer from the input, and it is explicitly stated to be 1.
4. **Variable `i`:** Defined as `t - 1`. This value is not directly used in the print statement.
5. **Variable `s`:** A string that includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. Since `k` is 1, `s` will be the first lowercase letter of the alphabet, which is 'a'.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n * s)
```

Here, `n * s` means the string `s` is repeated `n` times. Since `s` is 'a', the output will be the string 'a' repeated `n` times.

**Output Explanation:**
The print statement will output the string 'a' repeated `n` times, where `n` is the first integer from the input.

Output: **'a' repeated n times (where n is the first integer from the input)**
