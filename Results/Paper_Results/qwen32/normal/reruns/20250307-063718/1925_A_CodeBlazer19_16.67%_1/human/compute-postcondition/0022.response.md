The code snippet `s += chr(j)` concatenates the current value of `s` with the character representation of the integer `j`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is initially `chr(j + 1)`. After executing the code snippet, `s` becomes `chr(j + 1) + chr(j)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not directly modified by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values or their values as per the conditions provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer such that `k` >= 0, `s` is `chr(j + 1) + chr(j)`, `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`, `j` is `j + 1` such that `j` < `k + 97`.**
