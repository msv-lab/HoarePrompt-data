Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and `k` is not equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`, and `i` is equal to `t`.**
