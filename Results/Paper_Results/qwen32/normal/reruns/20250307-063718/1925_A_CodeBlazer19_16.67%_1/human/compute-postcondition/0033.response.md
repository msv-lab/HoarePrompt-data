The given code snippet initializes an empty string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is an empty string.**
