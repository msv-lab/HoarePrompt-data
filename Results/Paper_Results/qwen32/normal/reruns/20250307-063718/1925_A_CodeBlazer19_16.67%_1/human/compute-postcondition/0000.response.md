Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676.**
`t` is assigned the value of the input integer, while `n` and `k` retain their initial conditions as `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, and `k` is also an integer between 1 and 26. The number of test cases `t` is still constrained to be between 1 and 676.
