The code snippet `s = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `s`, overwriting its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is an empty string, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `t`.**
