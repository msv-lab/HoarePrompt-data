Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate the required string for each test case. Here's why:

1. **String Construction**: The program constructs a string `s` by appending characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet. For example, if `k=2`, `s` becomes `"ab"`. However, this string does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` letters are present as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Handling `k == 1`**: The program correctly handles the case when `k == 1` by repeating the single character `n` times. This is because there is only one possible subsequence of length `n` when `k == 1`.

3. **Handling `k > 1`**: The program incorrectly handles the case when `k > 1`. It simply repeats the constructed string `s` a few times based on the value of `n`. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

To correctly solve the problem, a De Bruijn sequence can be used. A De Bruijn sequence for a given alphabet size `k` and length `n` is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the problem requires a linear sequence, so the De Bruijn sequence can be linearized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def de_bruijn(k, n):
    a = [0] * k * n
    sequence = []

    def db(t, p):
        if t > n:
            if n % p == 0:
                for j in range(1, p + 1):
                    sequence.append(a[j])
        else:
            a[t] = a[t - p]
            db(t + 1, p)
            for j in range(a[t - p] + 1, k):
                a[t] = j
                db(t + 1, t)

    db(1, 1)
    return ''.join(chr(x + 96) for x in sequence)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(de_bruijn(k, n))

func()
```

This program uses a recursive function to generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given `k` and `n`, ensuring that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the resulting string.
