To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop iterates over a range starting from 97 up to `k + 97`. The variable `j` takes on each value in this range, and for each value of `j`, the character represented by `chr(j)` is appended to the string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- The loop starts with `j = 97` and continues until `j = k + 96`.
- For each iteration, `chr(j)` is appended to the string `s`.

Thus, after the loop completes, `s` will contain a sequence of characters starting from `chr(97)` up to `chr(k + 96)`. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a', so the string `s` will consist of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the final output state after all iterations is:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the English alphabet.

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, and s is a string containing the first k letters of the English alphabet.**

In simpler terms, the string `s` will be a sequence of the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.
