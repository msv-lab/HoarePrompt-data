The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by `chr(j)` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is defined as `k + 97`, the character appended to `s` will be the one corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 97`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the character represented by `chr(j)` followed by the character represented by `chr(k + 97)`**.

In simpler terms, the string `s` now includes an additional character at the end, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 97`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
