The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. 

Since the initial state already specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within specific ranges, the new values of `n` and `k` will be the integer values provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
