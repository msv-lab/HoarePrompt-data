Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is equal to 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `s` is a string of length `t * k` consisting of `t` repetitions of the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`.
   - `i` is equal to `t`.

2. **Given that `k` is 1:**
   - The sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)` translates to the sequence from `chr(97)` to `chr(1 + 96)` which is `chr(97)` to `chr(97)`. This means the sequence is just the character 'a'.
   - Since `s` consists of `t` repetitions of this sequence, and the sequence is just 'a', `s` will be a string of `t` 'a's. For example, if `t` is 5, `s` will be "aaaaa".

3. **The code snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n * s)
   ```
   - `n * s` means the string `s` is repeated `n` times.
   - Since `s` is a string of `t` repetitions of 'a', `n * s` will be a string of `n * t` repetitions of 'a'.

Therefore, the output will be a string of `n * t` repetitions of the character 'a'.

Output: **a repeated n * t times**
