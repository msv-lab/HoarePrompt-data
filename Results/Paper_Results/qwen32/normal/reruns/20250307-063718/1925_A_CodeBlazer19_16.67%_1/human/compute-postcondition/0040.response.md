To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and its behavior.

The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96` (since `range(97, k + 97)` generates numbers from 97 up to, but not including, `k + 97`).

In each iteration, the loop appends the character `chr(j)` to the string `s`. The variable `j` starts at 97 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k + 96`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- When `j = 97`, `chr(j)` is `'a'`.
- When `j = 98`, `chr(j)` is `'b'`.
- When `j = 99`, `chr(j)` is `'c'`.
- ...
- When `j = k + 96`, `chr(j)` is `chr(k + 96)`.

The loop runs `k` times, and thus `s` will be a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains the same integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `i` remains equal to `t - 1`.
- `s` will be a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.**
