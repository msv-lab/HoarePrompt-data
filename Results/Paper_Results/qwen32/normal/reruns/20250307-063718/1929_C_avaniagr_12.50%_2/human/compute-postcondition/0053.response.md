Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user input. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, the condition `a < x + 3` holds. If `x != k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k` is 2, otherwise `z` is calculated iteratively as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a >= z`. Otherwise, `a < z`.**
