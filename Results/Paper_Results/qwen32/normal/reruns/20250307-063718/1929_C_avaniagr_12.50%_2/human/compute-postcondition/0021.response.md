Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where `x` is greater than or equal to `k` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`.
- `z` is 1.
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` is being incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` before this line is not known).

The provided code snippet is:
```python
z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

This line modifies the value of `z`:
- `z // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `z` by `k - 1`.
- Since `z` is initially 1, `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 if `k - 1` is greater than 1 (which it will be, since `k` is at least 2 based on the constraints).
- Adding 1 to the result of the integer division and then adding that to `z` means `z` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, `z` will become `2` after this line is executed.

The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `i` which was already stated to be incremented by 1 before this line, and we don't have the exact value of `i` before that increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where `x` is greater than or equal to `k` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`; `z` is 2; `i` is `i + 1`**.
