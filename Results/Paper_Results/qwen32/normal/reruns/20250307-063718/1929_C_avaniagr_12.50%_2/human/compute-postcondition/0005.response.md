The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`) and their relationships, but these do not influence the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.
3. The variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used within the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
