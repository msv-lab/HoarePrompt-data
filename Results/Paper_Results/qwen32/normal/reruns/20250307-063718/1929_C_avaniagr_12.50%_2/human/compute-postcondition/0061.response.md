The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` mentioned in the initial state. These variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement explicitly prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
