Postcondition: **`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are input integers. If `x < k - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x >= k - 1`, then if `x == k - 1`, `a` is compared to `z` (where `z` is calculated as `(x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1))`), and `a` is either less than `z` or greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
