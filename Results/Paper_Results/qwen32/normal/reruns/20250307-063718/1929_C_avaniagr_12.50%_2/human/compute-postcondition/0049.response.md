Let's analyze the given precondition and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is defined as `t - 1`. This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1 from its previous value.
2. `k` is an integer.
3. `x` is an integer.
4. `a` is an integer.
5. `z` is calculated based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is 2, then `z = 2^(x+1) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `z` is calculated iteratively using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration.
6. `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
