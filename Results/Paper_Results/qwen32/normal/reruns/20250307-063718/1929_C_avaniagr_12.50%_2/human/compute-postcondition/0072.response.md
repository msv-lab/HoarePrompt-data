To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is `t` (its exact value is not provided, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `z` is calculated as \((x + 1) + \sum(\text{floor}(j / (k - 1)))\) for \(j\) in the range from 0 to \(x\).
- `i` is set to \(x + 1\).
- It is given that \(a\) is greater than or equal to \(z\).

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('YES')
```

**Analysis:**
The print statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, and `i`.

**Output:**
Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output is not influenced by any of the variables or their values.

Output: **YES**
