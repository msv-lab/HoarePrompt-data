The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state describes several variables: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement is hardcoded to print `'YES'`, the output will not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`.

Output: **YES**
