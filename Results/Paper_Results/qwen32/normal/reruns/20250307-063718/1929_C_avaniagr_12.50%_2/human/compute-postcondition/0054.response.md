Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user input. If `x < k - 1`, the condition holds true regardless of the value of `a`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds; otherwise, `a < x + 3`. If `x > k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `z` is calculated as `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k` is 2, otherwise `z` is calculated iteratively as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a >= z`; otherwise, `a < z`.**
