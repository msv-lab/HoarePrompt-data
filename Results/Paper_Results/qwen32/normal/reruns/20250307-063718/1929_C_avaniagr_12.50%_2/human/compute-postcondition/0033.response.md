The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` based on the input provided by the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as `t - 1`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now integers derived from the user input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user input.**
