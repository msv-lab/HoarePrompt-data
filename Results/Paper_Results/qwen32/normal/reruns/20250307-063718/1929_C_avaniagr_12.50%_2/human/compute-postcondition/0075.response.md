Postcondition: **t is t, k is an input integer, x is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is an input integer, z is (x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1)), i is x + 1. If a is greater than or equal to z, then a is greater than or equal to z. Otherwise, a is less than z.**
