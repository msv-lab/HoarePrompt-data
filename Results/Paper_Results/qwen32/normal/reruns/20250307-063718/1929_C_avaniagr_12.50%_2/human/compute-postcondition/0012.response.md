The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer provided by user input between 1 and 1000.
2. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are also integers provided by user input.
3. The current value of `x` is set to `k - 1`.
4. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
