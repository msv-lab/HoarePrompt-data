Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the three integers provided by the user input. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
