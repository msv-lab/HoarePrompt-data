Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the three integers provided by the user input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` remains unchanged if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than or equal to `k + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k` and not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `(x + 1) * 2 - 1` if `k > 2`, else `z` is `2^(x + 1) - 1`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user input. If `x < k - 1`, the condition holds true regardless of the value of `a`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds; otherwise, `a < x + 3`. If `x > k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `z` is calculated as `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k` is 2, otherwise `z` is calculated iteratively as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a >= z`; otherwise, `a < z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are input integers. If `x < k - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x >= k - 1`, then if `x == k - 1`, `a` is compared to `z` (where `z` is calculated as `(x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1))`), and `a` is either less than `z` or greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
