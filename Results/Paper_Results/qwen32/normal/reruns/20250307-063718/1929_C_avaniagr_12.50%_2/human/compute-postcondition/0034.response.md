The initial state describes that `t` is `t - 1`, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by user input. However, these variables (`k`, `x`, `a`) and the modified `t` are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`.

Output: **YES**
