The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state of these variables is not specified other than that they are integers provided by user input. The other variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values provided by the user input.
