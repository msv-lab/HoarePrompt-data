Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the three integers provided by the user input. The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 2`, which means `a` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.**
