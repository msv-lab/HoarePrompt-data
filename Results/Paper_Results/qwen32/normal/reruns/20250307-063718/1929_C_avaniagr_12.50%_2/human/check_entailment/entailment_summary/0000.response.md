### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` given the rules of the casino. The solution involves analyzing the conditions under which Sasha can achieve this goal.

The provided program uses the following logic:
1. If `x < k - 1`, then Sasha can achieve his goal if `a ≥ x + 1`.
2. If `x == k - 1`, then Sasha can achieve his goal if `a ≥ x + 3`.
3. If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates a threshold `z` which is the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can achieve any number of coins. This threshold is calculated based on the sum of a series where each term is the previous term divided by `(k - 1)` plus 1, repeated `x + 1` times. If `a` is greater than or equal to this threshold `z`, Sasha can achieve his goal.

The logic in the program is based on the following reasoning:
- If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he needs enough money to bet `x` times consecutively, starting with 1 coin and doubling (or multiplying by `k`) each time he wins. The sum of the first `x` terms of this series gives the minimum amount of money Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
- The additional conditions (`x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`) are special cases where the threshold is adjusted based on the relationship between `k` and `x`.

The execution summary indicates that the function reads the input correctly, processes each test case based on the described logic, and outputs the correct result for each case.
