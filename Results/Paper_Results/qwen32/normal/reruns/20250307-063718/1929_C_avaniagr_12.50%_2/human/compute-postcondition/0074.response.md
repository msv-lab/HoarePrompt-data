Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t` (This variable is mentioned but not used in the code snippet, so it can be ignored for the purpose of this task).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `z` is calculated as `(x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1))`.
- `i` is set to `x + 1`.
- `a` is less than `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The value of this string is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
