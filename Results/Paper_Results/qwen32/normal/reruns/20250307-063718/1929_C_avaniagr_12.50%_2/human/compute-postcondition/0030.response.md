Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the three integers provided by the user input. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `k + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k` and not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `(x + 1) * 2 - 1` if `k > 2`, else `z` is `2^(x + 1) - 1`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**
