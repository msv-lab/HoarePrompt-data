The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, `x` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `t + 1`. The value of `x` remains the same.

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1**
