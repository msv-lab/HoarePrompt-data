The code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not specified before the code snippet, so they are assigned new values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which is between 1 and 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the three integers provided by the user input.**
