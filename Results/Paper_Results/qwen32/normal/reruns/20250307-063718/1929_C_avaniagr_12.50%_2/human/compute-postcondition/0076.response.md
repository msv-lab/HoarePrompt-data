Postcondition: **`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are unchanged if `x` is not equal to `k - 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are unchanged, and if `a` is less than `z` (where `z` is `(x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1))`), then `a` is less than `z`. Otherwise, `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.**

To simplify:
Postcondition: **`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged if `x` is not equal to `k - 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is compared to `z` (where `z` is calculated as `(x + 1) + sum(floor(j / (k - 1)) for j in range(x + 1))`), and `a` is either less than `z` or greater than or equal to `z`.**
