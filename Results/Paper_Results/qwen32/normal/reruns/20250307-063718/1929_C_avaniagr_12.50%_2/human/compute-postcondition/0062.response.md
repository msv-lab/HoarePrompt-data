Postcondition: **`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are unchanged. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables either.**

Since both the if and else parts leave the variables unchanged, the overall postcondition reflects that the state of the variables remains the same regardless of the condition.
