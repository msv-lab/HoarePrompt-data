The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
2. The variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the code snippet.
3. Since there are no operations or conditions involving these variables in the provided code, their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
