The `print('NO')` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` because the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NO'` and does not depend on any of these variables.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 1`, but this operation does not affect the print statement since `t` is not used in the print statement.
2. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by user input, but they are not used in the print statement either.
3. The print statement is `print('NO')`, which directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
