The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers provided by user input, and `t` is described as `t - 1`. However, the value of `t` after this operation is not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
