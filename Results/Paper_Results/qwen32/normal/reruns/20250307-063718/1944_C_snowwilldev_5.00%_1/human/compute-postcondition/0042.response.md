Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and since `i` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
