The code initializes a new variable `cnt` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning that any new key will have a default integer value of 0. The variables `tc` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tc` is `N-1` where `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
