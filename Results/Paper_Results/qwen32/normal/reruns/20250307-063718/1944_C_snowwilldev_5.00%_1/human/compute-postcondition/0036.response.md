The provided code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` object named `cnt` with a default integer value of 0. This action does not affect the values of `N`, `tc`, or `a`.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `tc` is `X + 1` where `X` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration, and `X + 1` is less than the integer input `N`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
