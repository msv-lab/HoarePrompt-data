The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that `cnt` is now a dictionary that will automatically return `0` for any key that does not exist in the dictionary. The values of `t`, `N`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
