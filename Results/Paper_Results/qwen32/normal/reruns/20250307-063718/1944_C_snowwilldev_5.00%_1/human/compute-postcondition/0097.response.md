Postcondition: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `t` is originally less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then `t` remains unchanged and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `t`.**
