The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. The precondition that `N` must be greater than 0 and `tc` is `N-1` remains unchanged. The list `a` and its elements also remain unchanged. The only change is in the `cnt` defaultdict, where the count of the specific element `a[i]` is updated.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `tc` is `N-1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
