Postcondition: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement.**
