The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` of the list `a` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given the initial state where `N` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0, we can infer that `a` is a list with at least one element. The dictionary `cnt` must have a key corresponding to `a[0]` because the code does not handle the case where `a[0]` is not already a key in `cnt`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, while `N` remains greater than 0 and `i` remains 0.
