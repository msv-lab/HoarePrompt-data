`N` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `tc` remains `N-1` because `tc` is not modified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `tc` is `N-1` where `N` is an input integer.
Output State: **`tc` is `N-1` where `N` is an input integer.**
