Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively. Instead, it incorrectly attempts to find the first index `i` where `cnt[i]` is either 0 or there are at least two elements with a count of 1, which does not align with the optimal strategies described in the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to add elements to `c` that do not yet exist in `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to block Alice from adding elements that would increase the MEX.

The optimal strategy involves keeping track of the counts of each number and ensuring that the smallest possible number that hasn't been added yet is added to `c` by Alice, while Bob tries to prevent this by removing elements that Alice would prefer.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Counting the occurrences of each number.
2. Simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice always trying to add the smallest number that hasn't been added yet to `c`.
3. Calculating the MEX of the final `c` array.

Here is a sketch of the correct solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif cnt[i] > 1:
                cnt[i] -= 1  # Bob removes one of the duplicates
        
        # After Bob's optimal moves, Alice will add the smallest number not in c
        # Since Bob only removes duplicates, the mex is the smallest number not in c
        print(mex)

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

This approach ensures that we correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players and compute the final MEX of the array `c`.
