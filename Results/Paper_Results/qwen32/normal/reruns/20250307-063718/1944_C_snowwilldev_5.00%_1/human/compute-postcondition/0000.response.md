In the provided task, the for loop is iterating over a range determined by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `tc` will take on values from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. 

To ensure the loop executes, the variable `t` must be at least 1. The other variables `n`, `a`, and the integers within `a` are not part of the loop head and hence cannot be adjusted according to the task constraints. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, this condition is already satisfied by the problem statement.
3. **Adjust the state if necessary**: Given that `t` is already in the required range, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute, and no changes are required.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
