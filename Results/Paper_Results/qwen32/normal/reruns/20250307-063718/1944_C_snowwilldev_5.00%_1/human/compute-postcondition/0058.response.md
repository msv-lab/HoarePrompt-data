Postcondition: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part.**
