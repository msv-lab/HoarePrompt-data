The `break` statement will exit the current loop, but it will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `cnt`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
