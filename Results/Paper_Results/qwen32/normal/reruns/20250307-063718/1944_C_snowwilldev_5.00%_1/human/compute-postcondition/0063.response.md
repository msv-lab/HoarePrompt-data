Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `N`, `i`, `cnt[i]`, and `t` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
