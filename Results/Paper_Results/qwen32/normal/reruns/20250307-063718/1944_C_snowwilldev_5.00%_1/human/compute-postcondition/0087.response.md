Given the initial state where `N` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, the code snippet provided is `t += 1`. This line of code increments the variable `t` by 1.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about the initial value of `t`, we can only state that `t` is incremented by 1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is increased by 1.**
