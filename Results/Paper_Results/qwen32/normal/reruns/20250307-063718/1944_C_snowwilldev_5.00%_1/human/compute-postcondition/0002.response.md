Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In this output state, `t` and `N` retain their initial values, while `a` is now a list of integers that were read from the input and converted to integers using the `map` function.
