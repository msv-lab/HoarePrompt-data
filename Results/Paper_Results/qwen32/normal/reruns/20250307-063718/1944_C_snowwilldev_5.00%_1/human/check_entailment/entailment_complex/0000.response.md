### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The key part of the program is to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that either does not appear in the array `a` or appears exactly once. This integer `i` will be the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, given optimal play by both players.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Count Occurrences**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.

2. **Determine MEX**: It then iterates through the possible values from `0` to `N-1` and checks:
   - If the count of the current value `i` is exactly `1`, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` (indicating that there are at least two distinct values that appear exactly once), or if the count of `i` is `0` (indicating that `i` does not appear in the array), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Optimal Play**: The strategy is based on the understanding that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. By choosing the smallest `i` that either does not appear or appears exactly once, the program effectively simulates the optimal play where Alice and Bob make choices that lead to the smallest possible MEX.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `4, 0 0 1 1`
  - The counts are: `{0: 2, 1: 2}`.
  - The smallest `i` that does not appear or appears exactly once is `2`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4, 0 1 2 3`
  - The counts are: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`.
  - The smallest `i` that appears exactly once is `0` (but since all numbers from `0` to `3` appear exactly once, the loop will continue until `i=4` which does not appear, but the first break condition is met at `i=1`).
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2, 1 1`
  - The counts are: `{1: 2}`.
  - The smallest `i` that does not appear is `0`.
  - Output: `0`

The program correctly handles these test cases and the logic is sound based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it accurately determines the MEX of the array `c` after optimal play by Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
