Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all the iterations, the variable `cnt` will have a count of how many times each integer in the list `a` appears. The loop will have iterated `N` times, with `i` taking on each value from 0 to `N-1`, and for each index `i`, the count of the integer `a[i]` in the defaultdict `cnt` will have been incremented by 1. The values of `N` and `a` remain as per the initial conditions, and `tc` will be `X + 1` where `X` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration, provided `X + 1` is less than `N`.
