The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. Since `i` is the loop counter and `N` is the upper limit, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is greater than 0. After the loop body executes, `i` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1 and `N` must still be greater than 1.

The states `t` and `cnt[i]` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
