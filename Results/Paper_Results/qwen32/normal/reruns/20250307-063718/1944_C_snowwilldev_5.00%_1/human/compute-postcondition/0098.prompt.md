Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` must be greater than 0; `tc` is `N-1`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in the list `a`; `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `t` was originally less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `t` is originally less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then `t` remains unchanged and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
