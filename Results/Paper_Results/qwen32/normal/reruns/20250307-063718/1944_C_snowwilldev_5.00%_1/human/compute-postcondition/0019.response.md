Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory; `i` is 0. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
