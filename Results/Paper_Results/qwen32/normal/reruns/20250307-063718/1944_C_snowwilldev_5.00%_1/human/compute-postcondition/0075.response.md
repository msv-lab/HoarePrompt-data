The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the defaultdict `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- `tc` is `N-1`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[N-1]]` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is 0.

The code will increment the count of `a[0]` in the defaultdict `cnt` by 1.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0; `tc` is `N-1`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cnt[a[N-1]]` is incremented by 1, and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0.**
