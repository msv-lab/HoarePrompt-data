The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Prior to this operation, `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, meaning that if a key does not exist, it will be initialized to 0. After the operation, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` will be increased by 1. The values of `t`, `N`, and the other elements of `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
