Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.**
   - This indicates that `t` is set to 1 if the count of `i` in the `cnt` dictionary is 1. Otherwise, it remains 0.

2. **`N` is greater than 0.**
   - `N` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

3. **`a` is a list of integers.**
   - `a` is a list containing integers, but the specific integers are not provided.

4. **`cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where the default value for any key is 0 (since `int` as the default factory means the default value is `int()`, which is `0`).

5. **`i` is 0.**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.

6. **The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0.**
   - This condition implies that either `t` has been set to a value greater than or equal to 2 (which contradicts the previous rule unless `cnt[i]` was previously set to 1 and then incremented), or `cnt[i]` is 0.

### Analysis:

Given the conditions:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with `int` as the default factory, so `cnt[0]` is 0 if it has not been modified.
- The condition states that `t` is either greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. Since `t` is defined based on `cnt[i]` being 1, and `cnt[i]` is 0 by default, it aligns with the condition that `cnt[i]` is 0.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 0, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

### Output:

Output: **0**
