Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State**:
  - `N` is greater than 1.
  - `i` is initialized to 1.
  - The behavior of `t` depends on the value of `cnt[i]`. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, `t` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print(i)
  ```

- **Analysis**:
  - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
  - The variable `t` is not printed, so its value (whether incremented or not) does not affect the output.
  - The print statement directly outputs the value of `i`.

Given this information, we can determine that the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
