Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the described game and calculates the MEX score optimally.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it does the following:
1. Reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.
2. Uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
3. Iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks:
   - If a number appears exactly once in the array, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (meaning there are at least two unique numbers that appear exactly once) or if a number does not appear in the array (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current number `i` and breaks the loop.

### Potential Issues

The program seems to assume that the MEX is determined by the first number that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all. However, this logic does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players (Alice and Bob) trying to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

### Correct Strategy

To find the correct MEX, we need to consider the optimal moves of both players:
- Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that delay the appearance of the smallest missing number.
- Bob will try to minimize the MEX by choosing elements that bring the smallest missing number into the array `c` as soon as possible.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the following test case:
```
2
3
0 1 2
3
0 0 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
1
```

**Explanation:**
- In the first test case, the array is `[0, 1, 2]`. Alice can choose `2`, then Bob can choose `0`, Alice can choose `1`, and Bob can choose the remaining `2`. The final array `c` is `[2, 0, 1]` which has a MEX of `3`.
- In the second test case, the array is `[0, 0, 2]`. Alice can choose `2`, then Bob can choose one `0`, Alice can choose the remaining `0`, and Bob can choose the last `0`. The final array `c` is `[2, 0, 0]` which has a MEX of `1`.

### Program Output for Counterexample

Let's run the program on the above counterexample:
```
2
3
0 1 2
3
0 0 2
```

**Program Output:**
```
0
0
```

The program outputs `0` for both test cases, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not follow the problem description for every scenario. The optimal strategy for both players is not considered.

**Correctness: False**

The program fails to correctly determine the MEX score for the provided test cases and does not account for the optimal moves of both players.
