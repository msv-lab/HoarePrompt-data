To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given code and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop processes multiple test cases, each with its own list `a` and integer `N`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` and then iterates through the range `N` to find the first index `i` where either:
1. `cnt[i]` is 0 (meaning `i` does not appear in the list `a`), or
2. `t` reaches 2 (meaning there are at least two unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly once).

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the provided output states:

1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: The loop breaks when either `t` is `2` or `cnt[i]` is `0`. The value of `i` will be the index at which the loop breaks.
2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: No value of `i` is printed, and the loop completes all `N` iterations.
3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will terminate when either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. The value of `i` at the point of termination will be printed.

Given these points, if the loop executes multiple times (more than 3), the behavior will continue in the same manner: for each test case, it will either print the first `i` where `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` reaches 2, or it will complete all `N` iterations without printing anything.

Since the problem asks for the output state after **all** the iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state will be determined by the state after processing all test cases. The state of the variables `N`, `tc`, `a`, and `cnt` will reset for each test case, but the overall output will be the series of printed values of `i` for each test case where the loop breaks.

The key variables that will change are:
- `tc`: The test case counter, which will be equal to the total number of test cases processed.
- `t`: The count of unique integers that appear exactly once, which will reset to 0 for each test case.
- `cnt`: The count dictionary, which will reset to an empty dictionary for each test case.
- `i`: The index at which the loop breaks, which will be printed for each test case where the loop breaks.

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of test cases or the specific lists `a` for each test case, we can't determine the exact printed values of `i`. However, we can describe the final output state in terms of the printed values.

### Final Output State:
The final output state is the series of printed values of `i` for each test case where the loop breaks. If the loop completes all `N` iterations without breaking, no value of `i` will be printed for that test case.

Given the format requirement:

Output State: **The final output state is a series of printed values of `i` for each test case where the loop breaks. If the loop completes all `N` iterations without breaking, no value of `i` will be printed for that test case.**
