Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0; `tc` is `N-1`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The value of `tc` remains `N-1` and `a` remains unchanged.
