To determine the output of the given `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is set to 3 if `cnt[i]` was 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`.

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 2, we need to determine the value of `t` based on `cnt[i]`.

- If `cnt[2]` is 1, then `t` is set to 3.
- If `cnt[2]` is not 1, then `t` remains 0.

Since the exact value of `cnt[2]` is not provided, we cannot definitively determine whether `t` is 3 or 0. However, we know the value of `i` is 2.

The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`, which is 2, regardless of the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
