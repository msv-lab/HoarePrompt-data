The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state of `tc` is `N-1`, where `N` is an input integer. This value of `tc` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`tc` is `N-1` where `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
