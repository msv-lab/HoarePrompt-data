Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` for which either there is exactly one occurrence of `i` in the list or there is no occurrence of `i` in the list. If no such `i` is found by the end of the list, nothing is printed for that test case.**
