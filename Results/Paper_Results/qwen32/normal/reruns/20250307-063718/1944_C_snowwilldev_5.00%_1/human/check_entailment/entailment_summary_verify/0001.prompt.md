You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` for which either there is exactly one occurrence of `i` in the list or there is no occurrence of `i` in the list. If no such `i` is found by the end of the list, nothing is printed for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (only Alice does this), or deleting elements from `a` (both do this). The goal is to maximize the MEX of `c` when Alice plays optimally (to maximize) and Bob plays optimally (to minimize).

### Key Observations

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should try to include as many distinct numbers in `c` as possible.
3. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to prevent Alice from including certain numbers in `c`.

### Optimal Play

- If there is at least one number that appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure that this number ends up in `c` (by picking it on her turn and Bob not being able to pick it on his turn).
- If there are at least two such numbers, Alice can ensure that at least two distinct numbers end up in `c`, which means the MEX will be at least 2.
- If no number appears exactly once, Bob can ensure that the MEX remains as low as possible by preventing Alice from including certain numbers.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
- If a number appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
- If `t` reaches 2 (indicating that there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once) or if a number does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current number `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness of the Program

The logic in the program is correct based on the observations above. Here’s why:
- If there is a number that appears exactly once, Alice can include it in `c`, ensuring that the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice can include both in `c`, ensuring that the MEX is at least 2.
- If no number appears exactly once, the program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `a` (and thus will not appear in `c`), which is the MEX.

Given these points, the program correctly determines the MEX of `c` under optimal play by Alice and Bob.
