Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0; `tc` is `N-1`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in the list `a`; `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change is that the variable `t` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
