Let's break down the problem step by step.

The for loop provided is:

```python
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration is described as:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented from its previous value).
- `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- The postcondition is the same as the if part, suggesting that the loop has just finished executing the previous iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` (since it's the only variable in the loop head). The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again. So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not give us a specific value for `i` other than it being incremented, we denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (from the previous `i` value).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Note: The values of `t` and `cnt[i]` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
