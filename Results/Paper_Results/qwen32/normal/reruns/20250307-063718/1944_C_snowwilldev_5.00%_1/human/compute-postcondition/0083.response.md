Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- Either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.
- If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- The value of `t` and `cnt[i]` are not directly relevant to the output of the `print(i)` statement.
- The condition involving `t` and `cnt[i]` affects the value of `t` but does not influence the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Output: **0**
