The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `t` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is increased by 1.**
