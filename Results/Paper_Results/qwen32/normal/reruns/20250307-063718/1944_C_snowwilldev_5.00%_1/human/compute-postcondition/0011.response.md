The code snippet sets `t` to 0, affecting only the variable `t` and leaving all other variables unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` was an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and after the code execution, `t` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`.**
