The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 1, and `N` still needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**
