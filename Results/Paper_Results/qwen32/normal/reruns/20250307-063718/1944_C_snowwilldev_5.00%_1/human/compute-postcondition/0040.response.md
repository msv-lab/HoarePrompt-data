The code snippet increments the count of `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented. The value of `N` and the initial increment of `cnt[a[0]]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
