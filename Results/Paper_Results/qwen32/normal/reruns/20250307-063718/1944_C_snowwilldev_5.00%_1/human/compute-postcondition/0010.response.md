After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have taken on all values from `0` to `N-1`. This means that for each element in the list `a`, the corresponding count in the `cnt` dictionary will have been incremented by 1.

To summarize:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `N` remains the same as the input integer.
- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `cnt` will now be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`.**
