The `break` statement will exit the current loop or conditional block, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `t`, and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
