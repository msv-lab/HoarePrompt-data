Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range, `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i]` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
