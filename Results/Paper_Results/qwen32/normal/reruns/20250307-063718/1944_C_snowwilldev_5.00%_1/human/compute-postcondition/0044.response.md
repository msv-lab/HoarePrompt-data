The code snippet provided initializes a variable `t` to 0. None of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `a`, `cnt`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range, `t` is 0.**
