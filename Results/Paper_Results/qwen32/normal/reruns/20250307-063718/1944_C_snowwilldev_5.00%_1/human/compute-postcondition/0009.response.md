The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. 

Given the initial state, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**
