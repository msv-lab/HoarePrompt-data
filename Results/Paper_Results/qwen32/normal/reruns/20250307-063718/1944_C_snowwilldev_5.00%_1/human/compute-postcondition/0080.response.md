The code snippet `t += 1` increments the value of the variable `t` by 1. The initial state does not provide a value for `t`, so we can only say that `t` is increased by 1 from its current value. The other variables (`N`, `i`, and `cnt[i]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `cnt[i]` is 1; `t` is increased by 1.**
