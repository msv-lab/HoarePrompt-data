Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `N` is greater than 1.
- `i` is set to 2.
- There is a condition that checks if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. If true, `t` is increased by 1; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is not modified anywhere in the provided code snippet.
- The condition involving `cnt[i]` and `t` does not affect the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
