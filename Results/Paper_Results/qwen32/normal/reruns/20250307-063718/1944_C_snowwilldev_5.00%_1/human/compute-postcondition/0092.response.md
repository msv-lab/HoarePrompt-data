The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
