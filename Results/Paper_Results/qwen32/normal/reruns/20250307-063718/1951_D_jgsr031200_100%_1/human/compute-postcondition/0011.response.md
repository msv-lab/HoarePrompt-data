Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, still satisfying the conditions that they are positive integers, 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. The list `costs` remains as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The variable `h` is newly assigned the value 0.
