The given code snippet updates the value of `curr` based on the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state, `curr` is initially set to `n // i`. The code then reassigns `curr` to `n // i` again, which does not change its value.

Here is the detailed breakdown:
- `n` remains `n - i * curr`.
- `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}.
- `n` remains not equal to `k` and greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` remains the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` remains `n // i`.
- `curr` is reassigned to `n // i`, which does not change its value.
- `i` remains `n - k + 1`.

Since the value of `curr` does not change, the output state is the same as the initial state with respect to `curr`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // i`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
