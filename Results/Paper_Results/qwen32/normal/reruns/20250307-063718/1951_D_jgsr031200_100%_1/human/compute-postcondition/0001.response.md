The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `n` and `k` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - Currently, the value of `n` is equal to the value of `k`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` and does not reference the variables `n` or `k`, the output will be exactly `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
