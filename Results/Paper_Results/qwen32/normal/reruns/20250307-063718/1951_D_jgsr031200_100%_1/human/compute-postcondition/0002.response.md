In the given initial state, the values of `n` and `k` are both positive integers and are equal to each other. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
