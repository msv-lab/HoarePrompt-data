The given code snippet modifies the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. The other variables, `k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr`, remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the operation, which they are not in this case.

Given:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // i`.
- `curr` is `n // i`.

The operation `n -= i * curr` changes the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // i`, `curr` is `n // i`.**

In natural language, after executing the code, `n` is reduced by `i * curr`. The values of `k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain as they were initially defined, with `n` now being `n - i * curr`.
