Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the information step by step to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `n` is `0`.
2. `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
3. `n` is not equal to `k` (which is already satisfied since `n` is `0` and `k` is a positive integer).
4. `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Since `n` is `0`, this simplifies to `costs` being `[-k + 1, 1]`.
5. `i` is `n - k + 1`, which simplifies to `i` being `0 - k + 1` or `1 - k`.
6. `curr` is `n // i`, which simplifies to `0 // (1 - k)`. This is valid as long as `k` is not `1` (since division by zero is undefined). If `k` is `1`, `i` would be `0`, and the division would be undefined, but the problem states \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), so `k` cannot be `1` here.
7. `h` is `2 * (n // i)`, which simplifies to `2 * (0 // (1 - k))` or `2 * 0` which is `0`.
8. `h` is not less than `k`. Since `h` is `0`, this condition cannot be satisfied unless `k` is also `0`, but `k` is a positive integer, so this condition is inherently not satisfied based on the given constraints. However, the problem statement does not ask us to evaluate this condition for correctness but rather what the print statement will output.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
