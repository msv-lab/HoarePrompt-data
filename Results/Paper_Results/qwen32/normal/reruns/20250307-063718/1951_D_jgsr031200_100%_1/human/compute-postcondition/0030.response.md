Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` is `0`
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)
- `n` is not equal to `k` (which is always true since `n` is `0` and `k` is a positive integer)
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `2 * (n // i)` where `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `curr` is `n // i`
- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `h` is not less than `k`

### Calculations:
1. **Calculate `i`:**
   - `i = n - k + 1`
   - Since `n` is `0`, `i = 0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`
   - Given \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `i` will be a negative integer or zero. Specifically, `i = 1 - k` where `k` is a positive integer.

2. **Calculate `costs`:**
   - `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`
   - Substituting the value of `n` and `k`, `costs = [0 - k + 1, 1] = [1 - k, 1]`
   - Since `k` is a positive integer, `1 - k` will be a non-positive integer.

3. **Calculate `h` and `curr`:**
   - `h = 2 * (n // i)`
   - `curr = n // i`
   - Since `n` is `0`, `n // i` will be `0` for any non-zero `i`. Given that `i` is `1 - k` (a negative integer or zero), `n // i` will be `0`.
   - Therefore, `curr = 0` and `h = 2 * 0 = 0`.

4. **Condition `h` is not less than `k`:**
   - Given `h = 0` and `k` is a positive integer, `h` will always be less than `k`. However, this condition is not relevant to the `print` statement.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*costs)
```
- `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`
- The `*` operator unpacks the list, so `print(*costs)` will print the elements of the list `costs` separated by a space.

### Final Output:
- The first element of `costs` is `1 - k`, which is a non-positive integer.
- The second element of `costs` is `1`.

Therefore, the output will be the two elements of the list `costs` printed on the same line, separated by a space.

Output: **1 - k, 1 (where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18})**
