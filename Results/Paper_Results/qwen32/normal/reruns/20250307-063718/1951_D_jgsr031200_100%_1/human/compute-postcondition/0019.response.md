The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. Given the initial state, we know the values of `n`, `i`, and `curr` are interrelated. Let's break down the changes:

- Initially, `n` is defined as `n - i * curr`.
- `i` is defined as `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is defined as `n // i`.

After the operation `n -= i * curr`, `n` will be updated to `n - (i * curr)`. Given that `n` was initially defined as `n - i * curr`, the new value of `n` will effectively be `0` because `n - (i * curr)` cancels out the initial definition of `n`.

The values of `k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i)`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**.

In natural language: `n` is now `0`, while `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i` retain their initial values.
