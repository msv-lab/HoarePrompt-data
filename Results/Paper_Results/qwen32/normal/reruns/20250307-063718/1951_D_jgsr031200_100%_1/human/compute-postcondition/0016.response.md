The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `costs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `costs` and the variable `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element in the `costs` list, which means `i` was `1` (since `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`). For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `costs` list for `i` to iterate over.

However, given the provided `costs` list, there are only two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. After the first iteration where `i` is `n - k + 1`, the next iteration would have `i` as `1`. After that, there are no more elements in the `costs` list, so the loop would terminate.

Since the loop cannot execute one more time with the current `costs` list, we need to consider the state at the start of the first iteration. The initial `i` should be the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // i`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
