The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers and currently hold the same value, but this information is not relevant to the execution of the given `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(1)`.
2. This statement directly outputs the integer `1`.
3. The values of `n` and `k` do not influence the output of this statement.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
