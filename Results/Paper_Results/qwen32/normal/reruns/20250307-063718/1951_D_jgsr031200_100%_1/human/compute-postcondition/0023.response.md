The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. Given the initial state, `n` is `0`, `i` is `1`, and `curr` is `0`. Therefore, the expression `i * curr` evaluates to `1 * 0`, which is `0`. Subtracting `0` from `n` does not change the value of `n`.

Thus, the value of `n` remains `0`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i) + curr`, `curr` is `0`, `i` is `1`**.
