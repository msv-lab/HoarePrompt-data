The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `curr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this operation.

Given that `curr` is initially defined as `n // i`, the new value of `h` will be the previous value of `h` (which is 0) plus `n // i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `n // i`; `curr` is `n // i`.**
