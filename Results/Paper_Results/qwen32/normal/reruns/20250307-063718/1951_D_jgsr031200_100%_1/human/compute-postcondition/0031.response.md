Postcondition: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // i`, and `h` is `2 * (n // i)`. If `h` is less than `k`, then no further changes are made. Otherwise, no further changes are made either.**
