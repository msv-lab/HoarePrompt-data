Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Logic Error in Cost Calculation**: The program uses a hardcoded list `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` which is not guaranteed to work for all cases. The logic to determine the prices of the stalls is flawed. The program does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.

2. **Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The program only considers up to 2 stalls, which is not sufficient to handle all cases where more than 2 stalls are needed. The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

3. **Greedy Approach Not Implemented Correctly**: The problem requires a greedy approach where Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall, moving to the next stall only when she can no longer buy any more jewels from the current one. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n == k`, it correctly prints "YES" and sets the price to 1, but for other cases, the logic is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # We can use the binary representation of k to determine the prices
    # For each bit that is set in k, we create a stall with a price that will allow Alice to buy exactly that many jewels
    prices = []
    remaining_k = k
    current_price = 1
    
    while remaining_k > 0:
        if remaining_k % 2 == 1:
            prices.append(current_price)
        remaining_k //= 2
        current_price *= 2
    
    # If the sum of the prices exceeds n, it's impossible
    if sum(prices) > n:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    print('YES')
    print(len(prices))
    print(*prices)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected program uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. Each bit in the binary representation of `k` corresponds to a stall with a price that allows Alice to buy exactly that many jewels. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
