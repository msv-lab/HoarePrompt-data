The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints 'YES' and additional values if `n` can be reduced to 0 by subtracting multiples of `n - k + 1` and 1, such that the total number of subtractions is at least `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
