Reasoning:
The provided code has a logical flaw and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The function `func_1` tries to solve the problem by using a fixed set of costs `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The logic should allow for more flexible pricing to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the 60 stalls constraint.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles the cases where `n == k` and `n < k` correctly. However, the logic for the more general case (`n > k`) is flawed.

3. **Insufficient Flexibility**: The current implementation does not provide enough flexibility to set up the prices in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The prices should be chosen such that the cumulative number of jewels bought equals `k` and does not exceed the 60 stalls constraint.

4. **No Proper Loop for Multiple Stalls**: The current implementation only uses two stalls, which is insufficient for most cases. We need a loop to potentially use up to 60 stalls.

To correctly solve the problem, we can use a greedy approach to set up the stalls. We can start by setting the prices such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall until she has bought exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    remaining_n = n
    
    # Try to buy one jewel at a time from each stall
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_k == 0:
            break
        # Calculate the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at this stall
        max_jewels = remaining_n // i
        if max_jewels == 0:
            break
        # Buy as many jewels as possible without exceeding remaining_k
        jewels_to_buy = min(max_jewels, remaining_k)
        stalls.append(i)
        remaining_k -= jewels_to_buy
        remaining_n -= i * jewels_to_buy
    
    if remaining_k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
    else:
        print('NO')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using a greedy approach and does not exceed the 60 stalls constraint.

Correctness: **False**
