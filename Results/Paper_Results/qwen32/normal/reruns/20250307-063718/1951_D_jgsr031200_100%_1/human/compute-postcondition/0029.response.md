Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // i`.
- `h` is `2 * (n // i)`.
- `h` is not less than `k`.

### Calculation of Variables:
1. **`i` Calculation:**
   \[
   i = n - k + 1 = 0 - k + 1 = 1 - k
   \]
   Since \(k\) is a positive integer, \(1 - k\) is a negative integer.

2. **`curr` Calculation:**
   \[
   curr = n // i = 0 // (1 - k) = 0
   \]
   Division of 0 by any non-zero number results in 0.

3. **`h` Calculation:**
   \[
   h = 2 * (n // i) = 2 * 0 = 0
   \]
   Multiplying 0 by 2 results in 0.

4. **Condition Check for `h`:**
   The problem states that `h` is not less than `k`. However, based on the calculations, `h` is 0, and since `k` is a positive integer, `h` being 0 contradicts the condition `h` is not less than `k`. This implies that the initial state might have some logical inconsistency based on the given conditions. Nevertheless, we will proceed with the provided values.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(2)
```

### Output:
The `print` statement directly prints the integer `2` regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`, `curr`, and `h`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **2**
