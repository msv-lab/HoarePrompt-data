The code snippet initializes a list named `costs` with two specific values: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and still adhere to the initial conditions provided. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `costs` with these specific values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
