The given code snippet `curr = n // i` recalculates the value of `curr` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. Given that `n` is `0` and `i` is `1`, the calculation `0 // 1` results in `0`. Therefore, the value of `curr` remains `0`.

The values of the other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i)`, `curr` is `0`, `i` is `1`**.
