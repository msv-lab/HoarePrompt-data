The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given the initial state, `h` is initially `n // i` and `curr` is also `n // i`. Therefore, after the operation, `h` becomes `h + curr`, which is `(n // i) + (n // i)`, or `2 * (n // i)`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i)`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
