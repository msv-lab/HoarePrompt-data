Output State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i) + curr`, `curr` is `0`, `i` is `1`**

In this output state, `h` has been updated to include the value of `curr`, which is `0`. Therefore, `h` remains `2 * (n // i)` since `curr` does not change its value. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, `curr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
