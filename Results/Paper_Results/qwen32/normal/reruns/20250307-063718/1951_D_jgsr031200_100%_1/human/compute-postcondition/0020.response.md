The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `costs`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements of `costs`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`, which is the first element of the list `costs`. Since `costs` is a list with two elements `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the next value of `i` should be the second element of the list `costs`, which is `1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the second element of `costs`, which is `1`.

State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * (n // i)`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `1`**
