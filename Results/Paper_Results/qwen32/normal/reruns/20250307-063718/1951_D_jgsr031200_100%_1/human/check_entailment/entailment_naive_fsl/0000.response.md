Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not properly designed to handle the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Let's analyze why:

1. **Handling the case where `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies this scenario and outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.

2. **Handling the case where `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies this scenario and outputs "NO" since it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General case where `n > k`:**
   - The program attempts to create a list `costs` with two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - This approach is flawed because it only considers two stalls and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Additionally, it does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob needs to set up a series of stalls such that the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals exactly `k`. One effective strategy is to use a binary representation approach, where each stall's price is a power of 2, allowing Alice to buy a specific number of jewels from each stall.

Here is an example of a correct approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        stalls = []
        remaining_k = k
        remaining_n = n
        power = 0
        
        while remaining_k > 0:
            if remaining_k & 1:
                stalls.append(2 ** power)
                remaining_k -= 1
            power += 1
        
        if len(stalls) <= 60:
            print('YES')
            print(len(stalls))
            print(*stalls)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls by leveraging the binary representation of `k`. Each stall's price is a power of 2, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall corresponding to a '1' in the binary representation of `k`.

Since the provided program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
