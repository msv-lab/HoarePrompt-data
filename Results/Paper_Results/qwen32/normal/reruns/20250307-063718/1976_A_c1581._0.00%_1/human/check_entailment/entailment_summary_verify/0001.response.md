Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: Only lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Order Constraints**:
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - Digits, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.
   - Letters, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input, processes each test case, and uses the function `func_1` to determine if a password is strong. Here's a detailed breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `digits` and `letters` lists are initialized to store digits and letters separately.
   - `last_digit_index` is initialized to `-1` to track the index of the last digit found in the password.

2. **First Pass Through Password**:
   - For each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.

3. **Second Pass Through Password**:
   - For each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, `last_digit_index` is updated to the current index.
     - If the character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not `-1` (indicating a digit has been seen before), the function returns `'NO'`.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If all checks pass, the function returns `'YES'`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Order Constraint**: The program correctly ensures that no digit comes after a letter by tracking the index of the last digit and checking if any letter appears after this index. This is correctly implemented.
- **Sorting Constraint**: The program correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the lists to their sorted versions. This is also correctly implemented.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits. In these cases, the `digits` or `letters` list will be empty, and the sorting check will trivially pass.

### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. It ensures that all digits appear before any letters and that both digits and letters are in non-decreasing order. If these conditions are met, it returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required checks for a strong password as per the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
