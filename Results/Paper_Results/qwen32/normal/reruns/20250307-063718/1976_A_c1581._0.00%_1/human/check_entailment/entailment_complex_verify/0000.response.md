### Reasoning:
The original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior based on the annotations and the problem description:

1. **Condition 1: Valid Input**:
   - The problem assumes valid input (only lowercase Latin letters and digits). The program does not explicitly check this condition, but it processes the input as if it is valid, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Condition 2: No digit after a letter**:
   - The program uses `last_digit_index` to track the last occurrence of a digit. It then checks if any letter appears after this index. If a letter is found after the last digit, the program returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Condition 3: Digits sorted in non-decreasing order**:
   - The program collects all digits in a list and compares this list to its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'. This correctly ensures that the digits are sorted.

4. **Condition 4: Letters sorted in non-decreasing order**:
   - Similarly, the program collects all letters in a list and compares this list to its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'. This correctly ensures that the letters are sorted.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single character passwords**:
  - If the password is a single digit or a single letter, the program will correctly return 'YES' because there are no digits after letters, and a single character is trivially sorted.
  
- **All letters**:
  - If the password consists only of letters, the program will check if the letters are sorted and return 'YES' if they are.

- **All digits**:
  - If the password consists only of digits, the program will check if the digits are sorted and return 'YES' if they are.

- **Mixed letters and digits**:
  - The program ensures that no letter comes after a digit and that both letters and digits are sorted, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each key point, confirming the logic and flow of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles all edge cases appropriately and ensures that the password meets the criteria for being strong.

### Final:
Final: **True**
