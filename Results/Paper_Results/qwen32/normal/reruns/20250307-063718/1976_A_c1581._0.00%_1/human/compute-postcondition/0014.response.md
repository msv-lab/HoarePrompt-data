The code snippet `letters.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the `letters` list. Given the initial state, `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, so `letters` was initially an empty list. After appending `char`, `letters` will contain one element, which is `char`. The `digits` list remains unchanged as it was initially empty and the code does not modify it. The `password` string and `n` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `char` is a lowercase Latin letter; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
