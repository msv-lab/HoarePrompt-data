The code assigns the value of `i` to `last_digit_index`. This means that `last_digit_index` will now hold the same value as `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `char` is a digit; `last_digit_index` is `i`.**
