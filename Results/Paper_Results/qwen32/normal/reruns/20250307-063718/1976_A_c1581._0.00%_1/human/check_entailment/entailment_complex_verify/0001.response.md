### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code to confirm the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - **Annotation**: The state of the program right before the function call confirms that `password` is a string of `n` characters, each being a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

2. **Password Validation (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Two lists, `digits` and `letters`, are initialized to store digits and letters from the password respectively.
     - **Annotation**: After the first loop, `digits` contains all digits and `letters` contains all letters from the password in their original order.
   
   - **Order Constraint**:
     - The program tracks the index of the last digit found in the password using `last_digit_index`.
     - It iterates over the password again:
       - If a digit is found, it updates `last_digit_index`.
       - If a letter is found after a digit (`last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns `'NO'`.
     - **Annotation**: This ensures that no letter appears after a digit, which aligns with the problem requirements.
   
   - **Sorting Constraint**:
     - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
     - **Annotation**: These checks ensure that both digits and letters are in non-decreasing order, as required.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits by default, as the checks for sorting and order constraints would naturally pass in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required checks for a strong password as per the problem description. The annotations provided confirm the correctness of the program's behavior and reasoning at key points.

Final: **True**
