Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is `i + 1`. `char` is the character at index `i` in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to `i`. If `char` is not a digit, `last_digit_index` remains unchanged. If `last_digit_index` is not equal to -1 and `char` is not a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.**
