The given code snippet appends the `char` to the `digits` list. Based on the initial state, if `char` is a digit, `digits` initially contains `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` contains `char`. Since the code snippet appends `char` to `digits`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `char` is a digit, `digits` will have `char` appended to it, making it a list with at least one element.
2. If `char` is a letter, `digits` will still be an empty list initially but will now contain `char` after the append operation, making it a list with one element.

In both cases, `letters` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. `digits` is a list containing `char`. `letters` is an empty list if `char` is a digit, or contains `char` if `char` is a letter.**
