### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

1. **Conditions to be satisfied by the password:**
   - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password meets the conditions.
   - Inside `func_1(password)`, it separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter by iterating through the password and keeping track of the last index of a digit.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

3. **Validation through Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary confirms that the function checks the conditions as described.
   - It ensures that digits come before any letters and that both digits and letters are sorted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. The execution summary supports this understanding.

### Correctness: **True**
