Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: Only lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Order Constraints**:
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - Digits, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.
   - Letters, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a password is strong.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It tracks the index of the last digit found in the password.
   - It iterates over the password again:
     - If a digit is found, it updates the `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns `'NO'`.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Order Constraint**: The program correctly ensures that no digit comes after a letter by tracking the index of the last digit and checking if any letter appears after this index.
- **Sorting Constraint**: The program correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the lists to their sorted versions.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required checks for a strong password as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
