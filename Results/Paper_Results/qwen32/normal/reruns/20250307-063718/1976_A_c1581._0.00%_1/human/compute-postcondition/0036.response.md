To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions.

Here's the loop in question:

```python
for i, char in enumerate(password):
    if char.isdigit():
        last_digit_index = i
    elif last_digit_index != -1:
        return 'NO'
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string.
- If the character is a digit, `last_digit_index` is updated to the current index `i`.
- If the character is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'.
- If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means no lowercase letter appeared after any digit in the `password`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop will complete all iterations if and only if there is no lowercase letter that appears after any digit in the `password`.
- If the loop completes all iterations, `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in the `password`.
- The `password`, `digits`, and `letters` lists remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is determined by whether the loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO'. If it does, `last_digit_index` will reflect the index of the last digit, or -1 if no digits are present.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO', `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
- The `password`, `digits`, and `letters` lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` remains unchanged, `digits` remains unchanged, `letters` remains unchanged, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digits are present.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `password`, `digits`, and `letters` lists remain the same. The `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit found in the `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in the `password`. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means no lowercase letter appeared after any digit in the `password`.
