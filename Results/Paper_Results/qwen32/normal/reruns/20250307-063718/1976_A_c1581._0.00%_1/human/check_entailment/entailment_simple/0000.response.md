### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

1. **Separating Digits and Letters:**
   - The program iterates through the password and separates digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`). This is done correctly.

2. **Checking the Order of Digits and Letters:**
   - The program checks if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Checking the Arrangement of Digits and Letters:**
   - The program uses a variable `last_digit_index` to track the index of the last digit encountered. As it iterates through the password, if it encounters a letter and `last_digit_index` is not -1 (meaning a digit was previously encountered), it immediately returns 'NO'. This correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If all the above conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements all the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
