### Reasoning:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates digits and letters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done by iterating through each character in the password and appending it to the appropriate list based on whether it is a digit or a letter.

2. **Checking Order of Digits and Letters:**
   - The function checks if all digits come before any letters. This is achieved by keeping track of the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the function immediately returns 'NO'.
   - The function then checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `digits` and `letters` lists to their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Final Output:**
   - If none of the above conditions trigger a 'NO' return, the function concludes that the password meets all the criteria and returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the given conditions. It checks the order of digits and letters and ensures that both are sorted. Therefore, the program is correct.
