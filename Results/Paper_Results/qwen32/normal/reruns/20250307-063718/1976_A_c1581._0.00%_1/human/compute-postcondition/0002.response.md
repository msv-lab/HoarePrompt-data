To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the `password` string and the `char` variable.

Given the loop:
```python
for char in password:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `password` is a non-empty string. The variable `char` is just a loop variable that will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration of the loop.

Here are the states we need to consider:
- `password` must be a non-empty string.
- `char` is a loop variable and its value is determined by the `password` string, so we don't need to explicitly set it before the loop starts.

Since `password` is already defined as a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, it is guaranteed to be non-empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `password`.

The `digits` and `letters` lists are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list**.
