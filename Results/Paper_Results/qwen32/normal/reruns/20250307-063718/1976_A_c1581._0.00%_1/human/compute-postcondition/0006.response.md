Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing the current character `char`; the current character `char` is not a digit.**

Explanation: The code appends the current character `char` to the `letters` list. The `password`, `digits`, and the condition that `char` is not a digit remain unchanged.
