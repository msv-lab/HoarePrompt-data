The value of `last_digit_index` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `password`, `n`, and `char` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is `i + 1`, `char` is the character at index `i` in the `password` string, `last_digit_index` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `i` is `i + 1`; `char` is the character at index `i` in the `password` string; `last_digit_index` is `i`.**
