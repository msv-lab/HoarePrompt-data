Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing the current character `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the `digits` list now contains the digit `char` that was being evaluated, while `password` and `letters` remain unchanged.
