Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is `i`. Otherwise, `char` is a lowercase Latin letter and `last_digit_index` is -1. `i` is `i + 1`, `char` is the character at index `i + 1` in the `password` string. If `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO'.**
