The code snippet initializes an empty list named `digits`. The initial state specifies that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The only change made by the code is the creation of the `digits` list, which is initially empty. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping the `password` and `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is an empty list.**
