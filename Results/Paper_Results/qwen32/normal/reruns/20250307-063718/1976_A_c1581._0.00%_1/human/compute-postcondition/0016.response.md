Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, the `digits` list will contain all the digits from the `password` string in the order they were encountered, and the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they were encountered. The `password` string remains unchanged.
