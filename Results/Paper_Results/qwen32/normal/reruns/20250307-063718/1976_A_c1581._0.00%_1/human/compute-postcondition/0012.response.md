The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in the `password` string, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last character processed from the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in the `password` string.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact position of `char` in the `password` string, we can infer that `char` was the `i-th` character of `password` in the previous iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `char` should be the `(i+1)-th` character.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the `password` string.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
