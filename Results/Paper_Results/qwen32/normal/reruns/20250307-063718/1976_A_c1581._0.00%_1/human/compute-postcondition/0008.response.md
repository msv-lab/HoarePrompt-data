The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the `password` string. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to advance the `char` variable to the next character in the `password` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters.
- `char` is the current character being processed.
- `digits` and `letters` lists are dependent on whether `char` is a digit or a letter.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `char` should be updated to the next character in the `password` string.

Since we don't know the exact position of `char` in the `password` string at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the next character as the one following `char`. If `char` was at position `k` (0-indexed), it will now be at position `k+1`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
