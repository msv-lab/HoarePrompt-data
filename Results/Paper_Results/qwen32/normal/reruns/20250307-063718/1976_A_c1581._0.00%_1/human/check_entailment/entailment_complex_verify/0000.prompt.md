You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.

            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `password` remains unchanged, `digits` remains unchanged, `letters` remains unchanged, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digits are present.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` remains unchanged, `digits` remains unchanged, `letters` remains unchanged, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digits are present, and `digits` is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` remains unchanged, `digits` remains unchanged, `letters` remains unchanged, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digits are present, and `digits` is sorted. Additionally, `letters` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if a given password string meets specific criteria: it must have all digits appear before any letters, and both digits and letters must be in non-decreasing order. If these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

The program is designed to verify if a password meets the following criteria:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's the provided program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. The program reads the input and processes each password individually.
2. It separates the digits and letters into two different lists.
3. It checks if there is any letter that comes after a digit.
4. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
5. It checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.
6. Based on these checks, it returns 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Analysis of Correctness
- **Condition 1**: The program assumes that the input is valid (only lowercase Latin letters and digits). This condition is not explicitly checked in the code, but given the problem statement, we assume the input is valid.
- **Condition 2**: The program correctly checks if there is any letter that comes after a digit by keeping track of the last index of a digit and ensuring no letters appear after that.
- **Condition 3**: The program correctly checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version.
- **Condition 4**: The program correctly checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases
- **Single character passwords**: The program handles single character passwords correctly, whether they are a letter or a digit.
- **All letters**: The program correctly checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.
- **All digits**: The program correctly checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
- **Mixed letters and digits**: The program correctly checks that no letter comes after a digit and that both letters and digits are sorted.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and testing potential edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. There are no obvious cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem description. It ensures that no letter comes after a digit, that digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and that letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. It handles all edge cases appropriately.
