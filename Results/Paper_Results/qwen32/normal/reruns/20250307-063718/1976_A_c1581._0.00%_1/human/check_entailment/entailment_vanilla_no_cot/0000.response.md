Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for a strong password. Specifically, the check for whether a digit comes after a letter is not correctly implemented. The program uses the `last_digit_index` variable to track the last position of a digit in the password. However, it incorrectly returns 'NO' if a letter is encountered after any digit has been seen, regardless of the order. This means it will incorrectly mark passwords as invalid if there are letters after the first digit, even if all digits come before any letters and are sorted.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    seen_digit = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if seen_digit:
                digits.append(char)
            else:
                # If we encounter a digit for the first time, we need to make sure no letters come after it
                seen_digit = True
                digits.append(char)
        else:
            if seen_digit:
                # If we have already seen a digit and now we see a letter, the password is invalid
                return 'NO'
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This version correctly tracks whether a digit has been seen and ensures that no letters appear after any digits. It also checks that the digits and letters are sorted individually.
