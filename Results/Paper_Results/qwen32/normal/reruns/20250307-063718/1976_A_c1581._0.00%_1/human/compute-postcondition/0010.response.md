The code snippet appends the `char` to the `letters` list. Given the initial state, if `char` is a digit, `letters` is an empty list, and if `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` already contains `char`. After executing the code, `letters` will definitely contain `char` regardless of its initial state.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is a list containing `char`. Otherwise, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char` and possibly other lowercase Latin letters.**
