The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `char`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string and the loop variable `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the character that was just processed, and `char` is the character at index `i + 1` in the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `char` needs to be updated to the character at the new index `i` in the `password` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the index of the last processed character, and `char` is the character at `i + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `char` will be the character at the new `i`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is incremented by 1, and `char` is updated to the character at index `i` in the `password` string. `last_digit_index` remains unchanged.**

To summarize:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `char` is updated to the character at the new index `i` in the `password` string.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is `i + 1`, `char` is the character at index `i` in the `password` string, `last_digit_index` remains unchanged.**
