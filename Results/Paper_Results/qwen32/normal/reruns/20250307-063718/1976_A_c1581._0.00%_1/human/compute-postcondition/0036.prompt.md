Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(password):
    if char.isdigit():
        last_digit_index = i
    elif last_digit_index != -1:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is `i`. Otherwise, `char` is a lowercase Latin letter and `last_digit_index` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `char` is a lowercase Latin letter and `last_digit_index` remains -1. `i` is incremented by 1, and `char` is updated to the character at index `i + 1` in the `password` string. If `last_digit_index` is not -1 and `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is `i + 1`. `char` is the character at index `i` in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to `i`. If `char` is not a digit, `last_digit_index` remains unchanged. If `last_digit_index` is not equal to -1 and `char` is not a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
