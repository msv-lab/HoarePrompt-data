The code appends `char` to the `digits` list. Given the initial state, if `char` was a digit, `digits` already contained `char` and `letters` was an empty list. If `char` was a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` was an empty list and `letters` contained `char`. After appending `char` to `digits`, `digits` will now contain `char` regardless of its initial type, and `letters` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `char` is the next character in the `password` string; `digits` is a list containing `char` (and possibly other digits if `char` was a digit initially); `letters` is an empty list if `char` was a digit, or a list containing `char` if `char` was a lowercase Latin letter.**
