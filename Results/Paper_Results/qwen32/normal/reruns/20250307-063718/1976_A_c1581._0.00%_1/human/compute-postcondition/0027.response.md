The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `last_digit_index`. This means that if `char` (the character at index `i + 1` in the `password` string) is a digit, `last_digit_index` will now hold the value of `i`. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `last_digit_index` will still be updated to `i`, but it does not change the fact that the last digit found was at the previous `last_digit_index`.

Since the value of `last_digit_index` is now `i`, and the other conditions and values remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `last_digit_index` is `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `char` is the character at index `i + 1` in the `password` string.**
