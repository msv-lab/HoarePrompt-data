The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `check`, specifically `2 ** 31 - 1`. This value is a constant, 2147483647, which is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**
