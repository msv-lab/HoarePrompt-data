The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The variables `t`, `times`, `check`, and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
