The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the iterable `data`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `data` list. If the list has at least one integer, the loop will execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `data` must contain at least one integer. The other variables (`t`, `times`, `check`, `n`, `dic`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0**
