In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and `times`. The loop will execute if and only if `times` is greater than 0. The variable `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
3. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This state does not affect the execution of the loop.
4. The variable `check` is set to 2147483647. This state also does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need any adjustment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
