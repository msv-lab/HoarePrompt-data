Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one integer, `dic` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with its value decreased by 1, `ans` is 0, `s` is the result of `i ^ 2147483647`. The current value of `i` is a key in `dic` and its value has been decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `dic` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
