Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one integer, `dic` is a dictionary that contains the key `i`, `ans` is 0, `s` is the result of `i ^ 2147483647`. The current value of `i` is a key in `dic`.**
