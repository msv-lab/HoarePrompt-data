In the given task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converted to an integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a string representing an integer greater than 0. This input determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute one more time, the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must still be greater than 0.

However, since the loop uses the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` directly in the `range` function, and this value is not stored or modified within the loop head, we need to consider the state of the input source (`sys.stdin.readline()`).

Given that `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a new line from the input each time it is called, the state we need to adjust is the input source itself. But since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not contain any stateful objects that can be directly adjusted, we can only infer the necessary condition for the loop to execute one more time based on the loop head expression.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the next call to `sys.stdin.readline()` must still result in a string representing an integer greater than 0.

State: **The input read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a string representing an integer greater than 0**
