The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` creates a new list `coef` with `n` elements, all initialized to `None`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `tot`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0.**
