The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially False, then `visited[1]` is now True, `coef[1]` is 1 (or potentially updated based on DFS logic), `ok` is `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`, and `tot` and `bipartite` may be updated based on DFS logic. If `visited[1]` was initially True, then `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. `i` is 2**
