Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where `visited[i]` is False, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, `i` is 0. The current value of `visited[i]` is False**
