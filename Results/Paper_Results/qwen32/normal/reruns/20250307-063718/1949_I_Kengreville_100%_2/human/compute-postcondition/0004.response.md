Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of None values, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The code reassigns `visited` to be a list of `False` values of length `n`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
