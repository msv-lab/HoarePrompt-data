Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `x` will contain `n` integers, the variable `y` will also contain `n` integers, and the variable `r` will contain `n` integers, all of which were input during the loop's execution. The `visited` list remains unchanged as a list of `False` values, and the variables `coef` and `tot` remain unchanged as a list of `None` values and `0`, respectively.
