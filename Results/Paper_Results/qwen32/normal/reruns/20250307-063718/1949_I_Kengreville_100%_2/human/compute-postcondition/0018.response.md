Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where `visited[i]` is False, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[0]` which is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, `i` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `coef[0]` has been updated to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
