The code snippet assigns three input integers to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` where `i` is 4. The values of `n`, the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and the variable `tot` remain unchanged except for the specific indices in `x`, `y`, and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[4]` which is an input integer, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[4]` which is an input integer, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[4]` which is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `i` is 4.**
