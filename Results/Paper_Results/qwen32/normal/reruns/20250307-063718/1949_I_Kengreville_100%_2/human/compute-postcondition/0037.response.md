Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially False, then `visited[1]` is now True, `coef[1]` is 1 (or potentially updated based on DFS logic), and `tot` and `bipartite` may be updated based on DFS logic. If `visited[1]` was initially True, then `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. If `visited[2]` was initially False, then `visited[2]` is now True, `coef[2]` is 1, and `ok` is `True` if the original `ok` was `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not equal to `0`. If `visited[2]` was initially True, then `visited[2]`, `coef[2]`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. `i` is 2.**
