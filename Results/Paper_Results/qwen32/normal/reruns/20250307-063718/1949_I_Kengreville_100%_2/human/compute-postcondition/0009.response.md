The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. This means that the `None` values at index `i` in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will be replaced with the three integers provided as input. The other elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain as `None`, and the other variables (`n`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is an input integer, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is an input integer, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**
