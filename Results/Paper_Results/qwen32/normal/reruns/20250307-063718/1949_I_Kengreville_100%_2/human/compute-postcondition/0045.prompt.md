You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1], visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal, and tot is an integer initialized to 0 which will be used to accumulate the total difference in radii during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is True if it was visited during the loop, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except for indices that were visited, where `coef[i]` is set to 1 or potentially updated based on DFS logic, `tot` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `bipartite` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `ok` is True if any DFS call resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is True if it was visited during the loop, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except for indices that were visited, where `coef[i]` is set to 1 or potentially updated based on DFS logic, `tot` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `bipartite` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `i` is `n-1`. If `ok` is True, it indicates that at least one DFS call resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0. If `ok` is False, no DFS call resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly but operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `tot`. It performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`). The function updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited and populates the `coef` list with coefficients during the traversal. It also accumulates the total difference in radii in the `tot` variable. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the global variables `visited`, `coef`, and `tot` as a result of its execution.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
