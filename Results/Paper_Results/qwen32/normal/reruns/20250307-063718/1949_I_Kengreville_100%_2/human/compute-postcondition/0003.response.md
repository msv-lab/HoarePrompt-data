The provided code snippet reassigns the list `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. This overwrites the previous list `r` which contained the radii of the disks. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of None values, `tot` is 0**
