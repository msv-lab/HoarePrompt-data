The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the `i`-th positions of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. Since the specific value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, we will assume that `i` is a valid index within the range of the lists (0 to `n-1`).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is an input integer, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is an input integer, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0**.

In natural language: The value at the `i`-th position of the list `x` is now an input integer, the value at the `i`-th position of the list `y` is now an input integer, and the value at the `i`-th position of the list `r` is now an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
