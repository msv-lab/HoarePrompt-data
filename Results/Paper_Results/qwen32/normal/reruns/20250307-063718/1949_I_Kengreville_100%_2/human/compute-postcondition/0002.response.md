The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `y` to a new list containing `n` `None` values. This means the previous list `y` of integers where `y[i]` were the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk is replaced by a list of `None` values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, `n`-1], `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal, and `tot` is an integer initialized to 0 which will be used to accumulate the total difference in radii during the DFS traversal.**
