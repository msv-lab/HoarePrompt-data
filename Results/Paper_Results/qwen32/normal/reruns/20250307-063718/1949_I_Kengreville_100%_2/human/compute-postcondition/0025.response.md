Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where `visited[0]` is True if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it retains its initial value, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[0]` which is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it retains its initial value, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, `i` is 1, `coef[1]` is 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `coef[1]` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
