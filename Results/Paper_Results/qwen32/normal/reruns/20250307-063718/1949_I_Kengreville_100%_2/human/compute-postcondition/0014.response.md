Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True.**

The variable `bipartite` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
