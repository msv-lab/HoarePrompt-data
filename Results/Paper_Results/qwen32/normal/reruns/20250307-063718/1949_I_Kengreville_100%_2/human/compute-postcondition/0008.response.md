The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is an input integer, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is an input integer, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
