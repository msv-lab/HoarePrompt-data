Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False (all elements are False), `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where `visited[0]` is True if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it retains its initial value, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[0]` which is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it retains its initial value, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially False, then `visited[1]` is now True, `coef[1]` is 1 (or potentially updated based on DFS logic), `ok` is `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`, and `tot` and `bipartite` may be updated based on DFS logic. If `visited[1]` was initially True, then `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. `i` remains 1 unless updated within the DFS function.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially False, then `visited[1]` is now True, `coef[1]` is 1 (or potentially updated based on DFS logic), and `tot` and `bipartite` may be updated based on DFS logic. If `visited[1]` was initially True, then `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. If `visited[2]` was initially False, then `visited[2]` is now True, `coef[2]` is 1, and `ok` is `True` if the original `ok` was `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not equal to `0`. If `visited[2]` was initially True, then `visited[2]`, `coef[2]`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
