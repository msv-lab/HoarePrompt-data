Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is True if it was visited during the loop, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except for indices that were visited, where `coef[i]` is set to 1 or potentially updated based on DFS logic, `tot` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `bipartite` is the final value updated by the last DFS call, `i` is `n-1`. If `ok` is True, it indicates that at least one DFS call resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0. If `ok` is False, no DFS call resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0.**
