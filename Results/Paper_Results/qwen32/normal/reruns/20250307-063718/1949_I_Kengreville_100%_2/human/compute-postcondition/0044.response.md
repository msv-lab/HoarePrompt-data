Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly but operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `tot`. It performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`). The function updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited and populates the `coef` list with coefficients during the traversal. It also accumulates the total difference in radii in the `tot` variable. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the global variables `visited`, `coef`, and `tot` as a result of its execution.**
