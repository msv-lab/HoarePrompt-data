Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially False, then `visited[1]` is now True, `coef[1]` is 1 (or potentially updated based on DFS logic), `ok` is `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`, and `tot` and `bipartite` may be updated based on DFS logic. If `visited[1]` was initially True, then `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values. `i` is 2, `coef[2]` is 1, `tot` is 0.**
