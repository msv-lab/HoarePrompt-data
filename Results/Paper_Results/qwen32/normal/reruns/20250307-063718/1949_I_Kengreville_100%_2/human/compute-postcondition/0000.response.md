Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]`, `y[i]` are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= `x[i]`, `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, `n`-1], `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal, and `tot` is an integer initialized to 0 which will be used to accumulate the total difference in radii during the DFS traversal.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
