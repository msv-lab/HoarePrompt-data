The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending `a` to the list at index `b`. This means that the list at index `b` in `adj` now includes `a` in addition to whatever elements it already had.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is affected by this operation is `adj`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
