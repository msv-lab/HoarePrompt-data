The code creates a list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `z` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists**.
