Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will have been fully populated with all the connections between nodes as specified by the input. The variables `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged from their initial values, except `i` will have reached `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input.
