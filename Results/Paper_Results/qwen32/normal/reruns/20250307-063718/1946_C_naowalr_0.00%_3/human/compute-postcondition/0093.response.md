The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
