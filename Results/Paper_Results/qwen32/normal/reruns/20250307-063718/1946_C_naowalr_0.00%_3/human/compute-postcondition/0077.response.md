Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
