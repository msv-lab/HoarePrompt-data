The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the sublist at index `a`. This means the sublist at `adj[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Here are the updates to the variables:
- `adj`: The sublist at index `a` will now contain `b` as one of its elements.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` includes `b`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
