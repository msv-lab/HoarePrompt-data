The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
