Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is 50001; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` is 50001.**

In natural language, the value of `L` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
