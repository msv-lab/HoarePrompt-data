The value of `x` is recalculated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 75000 and `R` is 75002, the new value of `x` will be:

\[ x = \frac{75000 + 75002}{2} = \frac{150002}{2} = 75001 \]

The values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 75000, `R` is 75002**.
