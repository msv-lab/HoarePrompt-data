The `while` loop condition is `R - L > 1`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

The difference `R - L` is `100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can execute at least once with the current values of `L` and `R`.

Since `L` and `R` already satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input.**
