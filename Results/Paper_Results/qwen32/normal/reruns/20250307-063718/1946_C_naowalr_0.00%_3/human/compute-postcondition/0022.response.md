Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**

In this output state, the only change is that `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
