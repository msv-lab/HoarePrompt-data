The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentioned that `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` are incremented by 1, but this increment operation is not reflected in the provided code snippet. Therefore, only `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while `t` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n` and `k` are the values read from the input. `t` and `z` are incremented by 1. `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`. `numCuts` is 0.**

In simpler terms: The values of `n` and `k` are now the integers read from the input. The other variables (`adj`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
