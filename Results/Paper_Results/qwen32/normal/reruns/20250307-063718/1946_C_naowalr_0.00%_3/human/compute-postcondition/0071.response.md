The code snippet provided is `R = x`. Given that `x` is 50001, the value of `R` is updated to 50001. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`. Additionally, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
