The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This operation does not affect the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, the value of `n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\). The new variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `t` is the integer read from the input.**
