The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
