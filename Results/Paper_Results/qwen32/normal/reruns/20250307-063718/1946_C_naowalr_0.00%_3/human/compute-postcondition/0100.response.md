The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` will be at least 1, and the loop can still execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
