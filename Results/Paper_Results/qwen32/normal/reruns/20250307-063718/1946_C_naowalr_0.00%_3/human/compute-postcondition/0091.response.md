The provided code snippet reinitializes the `adj` variable as a list of `n + 1` empty lists. This means that the previous contents of `adj` are discarded, and `adj` now contains `n + 1` empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
