The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding the integer `b` to the sublist at index `a`. This means that the connection between nodes `a` and `b` is updated in the adjacency list.

Here's the output state with the updated information:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**

In natural language, the adjacency list `adj` has been updated so that the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
