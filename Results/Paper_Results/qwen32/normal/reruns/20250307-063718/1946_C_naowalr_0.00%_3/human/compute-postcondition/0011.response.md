The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` as an additional element to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` already includes `a` as an additional element, meaning `a` appears at least once in `adj[b]`. After executing the code, `a` will appear twice in `adj[b]`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element (now `b` appears twice); `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element (now `a` appears twice); `i` is `i + 1`.**
