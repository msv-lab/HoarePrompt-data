The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the values read from the input. The other variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**.
