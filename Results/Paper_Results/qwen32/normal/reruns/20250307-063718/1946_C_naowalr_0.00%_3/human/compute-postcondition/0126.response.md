Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is `x` and `R` is 100001; otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001 if `numCuts` is less than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`**

In this output state, the value of `numCuts` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
