The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list at index `a` in the `adj` list by appending the value `b` to it. This means the list at index `a` now includes `b` at least once, fulfilling the precondition that the list at index `a` includes `b` at least once, and implicitly ensuring that the list at index `b` includes `a` at least once (as per the initial state description).

No other variables are modified by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` at least once and the list at index `b` includes `a` at least once; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
