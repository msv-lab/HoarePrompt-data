Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or less than `k`, or if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`; `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001 if `numCuts` is less than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`; `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `x` has been updated to the average of `L` and `R`. The values of `L` and `R` depend on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, but the other variables remain unchanged.
