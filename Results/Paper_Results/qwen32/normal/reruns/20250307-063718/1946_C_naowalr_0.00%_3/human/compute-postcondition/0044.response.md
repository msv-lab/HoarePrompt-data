Based on the provided initial state, we know that `L` and `R` are final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`. However, the exact values of `L` and `R` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `L` based on the given condition.

The `print(L)` statement will output the value of `L`, which is one of the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`.

Output: **L (where L is one of the final values that satisfy the condition R - L <= 1)**
