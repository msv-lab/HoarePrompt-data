Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged. `x` is 50001. `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged. `x` is either 75001 or 25001. `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` is either 75001 or 25001. Otherwise, `R` is either 75001 or 25001.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z` remain unchanged, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 75001 and `R` is 75002. Otherwise, `L` is 75000 and `R` is 75001.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
