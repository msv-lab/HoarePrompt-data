The given code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided.

The initial state mentioned includes `a` and `b` as integers obtained from the input line, and it also mentions that `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element, and `i` is `i + 1`. However, the code snippet does not affect `adj` or `i`. It only updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the new input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input. The lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` still include `b` and `a` respectively as additional elements, and `i` remains incremented by 1.
