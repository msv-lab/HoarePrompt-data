The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to the variable `R`. Since `x` is either 75001 or 25001, `R` will take on one of these values. The values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `leftover`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged. `x` is either 75001 or 25001. `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. `numCuts` is 0. `R` is either 75001 or 25001.**
