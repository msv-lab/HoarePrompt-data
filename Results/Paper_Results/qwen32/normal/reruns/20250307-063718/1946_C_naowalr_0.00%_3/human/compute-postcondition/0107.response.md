The code snippet provided sets `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
