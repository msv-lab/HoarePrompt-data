The code snippet calls a function `dfs` with arguments `1` and `1` and assigns the result to the variable `leftover`. The values of `L`, `R`, `x`, and `numCuts` are not modified by this function call.

Output State: **`L` and `R` are defined; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**
