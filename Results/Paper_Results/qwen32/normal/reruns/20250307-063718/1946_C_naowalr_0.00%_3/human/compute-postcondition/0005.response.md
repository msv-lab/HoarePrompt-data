The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state is that `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, after the code executes, `a` and `b` will hold the integer values obtained from the input line.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line.**
