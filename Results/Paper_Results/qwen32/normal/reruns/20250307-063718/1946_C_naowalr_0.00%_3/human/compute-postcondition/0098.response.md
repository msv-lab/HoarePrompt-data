The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending `b` to the sublist at index `a`. This means that the connection between nodes `a` and `b` is now explicitly recorded in the adjacency list.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**

In natural language: The adjacency list `adj` has been updated to include `b` in the sublist at index `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
