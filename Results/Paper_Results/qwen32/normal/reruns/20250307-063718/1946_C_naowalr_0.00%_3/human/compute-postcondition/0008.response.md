The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Or more formally:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n - 1`**.

Given that the previous state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can simply state:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is `i + 1`**.
