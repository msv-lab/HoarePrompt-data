The code snippet simply initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. None of the other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**.
