The code snippet provided assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is 50001, `L` will now hold this value. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` is 50001; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.
