Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is `(L + R) // 2`; `R` is 100001 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `R` is 50001 if `numCuts` is less than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.**

In simple terms, the variable `L` is now set to the value of `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. The value of `R` remains unchanged unless `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, in which case `R` is set to 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is set to 50001. All other variables remain as they were initially.
