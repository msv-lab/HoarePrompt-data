To determine the new state after the execution of `leftover = dfs(1, 1)`, we need to understand that the function `dfs(1, 1)` is being called, and its return value is assigned to the variable `leftover`. However, since the function `dfs` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover` after the function call. We can only state that `leftover` will hold whatever value `dfs(1, 1)` returns.

Given this, the variables `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `x`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged. The only change is that `leftover` is updated to the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z` remain unchanged, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 75000, `R` is 75002.**
