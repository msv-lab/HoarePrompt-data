Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged. `x` is either 75001 or 25001. `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` is either 75001 or 25001. Otherwise, `R` is either 75001 or 25001.**
