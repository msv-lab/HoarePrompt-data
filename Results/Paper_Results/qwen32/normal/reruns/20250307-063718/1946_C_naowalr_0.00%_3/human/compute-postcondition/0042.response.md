Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z` remain unchanged, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 75001 and `R` is 75002. Otherwise, `L` is 75000 and `R` is 75001.**
