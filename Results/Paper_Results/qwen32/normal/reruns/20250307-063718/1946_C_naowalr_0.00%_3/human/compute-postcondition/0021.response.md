The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` becomes `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `50001`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.
