Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input.**

This means that the value of `R` has been updated to 100001, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
