Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the integers `b` that are connected to `a` as read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `i` is `n - 2`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50000. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50002. Additionally, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**

In natural language: The variable `x` has been updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
