Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`**
