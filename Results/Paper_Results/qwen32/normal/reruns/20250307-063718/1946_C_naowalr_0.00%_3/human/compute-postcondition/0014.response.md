The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Given the initial state, `adj[a]` already includes `b` as an additional element, so after executing the code, `b` will appear three times in `adj[a]`. The other variables `a`, `b`, `adj[b]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are new integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` three times; `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element (now `a` appears twice); `i` is `i + 1`.**
