The code assigns the value of `int(100000.0 + 1)` to the variable `R`. This results in `R` being assigned the value `100001`. None of the other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, or `L`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, representing the adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges; `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**
