The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` modifies the adjacency list by appending `a` to the sublist at index `b`. This means that the connection between nodes `a` and `b` is explicitly added to the adjacency list `adj`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `adj`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
