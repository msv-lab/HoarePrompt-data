Postcondition: **`L` and `R` are defined; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` remains `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.**
