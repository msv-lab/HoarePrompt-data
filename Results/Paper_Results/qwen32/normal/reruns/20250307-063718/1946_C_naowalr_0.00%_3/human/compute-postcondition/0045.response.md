The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains unchanged. Since `z` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.
