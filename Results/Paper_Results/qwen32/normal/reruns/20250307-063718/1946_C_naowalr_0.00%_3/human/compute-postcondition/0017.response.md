Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, representing the adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges; `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged; `L` is 1.**

In this output state, the adjacency list `adj` and the variables `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` retain their initial values. The variable `L` has been assigned the value of 1.
