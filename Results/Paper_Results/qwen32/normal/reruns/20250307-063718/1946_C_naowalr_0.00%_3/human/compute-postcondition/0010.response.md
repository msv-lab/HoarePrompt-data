The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already includes `b` as per the initial state, appending `b` again will result in `b` appearing twice in the list `adj[a]`. The list `adj[b]` and the integer `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` as an additional element (now `b` appears twice); `adj[b]` includes `a` as an additional element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
