The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list of lists. This means that the list at index `b` in `adj` will now include `a` at least once.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` at least once and the list at index `b` includes `a` at least twice; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
