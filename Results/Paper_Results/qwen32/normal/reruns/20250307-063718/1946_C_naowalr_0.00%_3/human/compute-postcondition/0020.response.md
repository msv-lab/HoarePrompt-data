To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `R - L > 1`. The variables `R` and `L` are the only ones mentioned in the loop head.

Given:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

The condition `R - L > 1` translates to `100001 - 1 > 1`, which is `100000 > 1`. This condition is already true, so no adjustments are needed for `L` and `R` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Since the condition is already satisfied with the given values of `L` and `R`, we do not need to modify any other states. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
