The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` calculates the midpoint of the range defined by `L` and `R` and assigns it to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Therefore, the value of `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `50001`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `adj` is still a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency list of a graph, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the value read from the input, `t` and `z` are incremented by 1 and 2 respectively, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `x` is 50001**.
