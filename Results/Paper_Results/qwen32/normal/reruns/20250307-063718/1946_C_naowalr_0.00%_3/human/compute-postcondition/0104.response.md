Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will have been fully populated with all the edges read from the input, meaning that for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read, `b` will be in the sublist at index `a` and `a` will be in the sublist at index `b`. The variables `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from their descriptions in the initial state, except that `i` will have reached the value `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
