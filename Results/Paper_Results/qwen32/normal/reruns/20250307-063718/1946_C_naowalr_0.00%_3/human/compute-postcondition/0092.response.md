The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 2`, which is less than `n - 1` as long as `n` is at least 2 (which is given). Therefore, the loop can execute with the current value of `i`.

However, to ensure the loop starts correctly and adheres to the loop head variables, we need to set `i` to the starting value of the loop, which is 0.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `L` is the final value found by the binary search that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is the number of cuts determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function in the final iteration; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration**.
