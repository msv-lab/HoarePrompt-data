Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` includes `a` for all `a` and `b` pairs read from the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` is incremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from the input; `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001 if `numCuts` was less than `k` or `numCuts` was equal to `k` and `leftover` was less than `x`; `R` is `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `R` is updated to be equal to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
