The code snippet simply assigns `0` to the variable `numCuts`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `x`, `leftover`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`, `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 75000, `R` is 75002.**
