The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at `adj[a]` will now contain `b` as one of its elements. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now includes `b`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
