Output State: **`a` and `b` are new integers obtained from the input line; `adj[a]` includes `b` three times; `adj[b]` includes `a` three times; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` includes `a` twice. After the code is executed, `adj[b]` will include `a` three times. The values of `a` and `b` remain the same. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, as per the initial state description.
