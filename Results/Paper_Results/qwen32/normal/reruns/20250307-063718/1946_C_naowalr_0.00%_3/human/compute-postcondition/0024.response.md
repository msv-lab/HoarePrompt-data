Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `i`. `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged. `L` is 1, `R` is 100001. `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. `x` is 50001. `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.**
