The given code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list of lists. This means that the adjacency list representation of some graph or structure is being updated by adding an edge from `a` to `b`.

Given the initial state, the list at index `a` in `adj` already includes `b` and vice versa, which suggests that the graph is undirected and the edge between `a` and `b` is already present. However, the code snippet will still append `b` to the list at index `a` again, potentially creating a duplicate entry if it wasn't already there.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` at least once and the list at index `b` includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the value read from the input; `t` and `z` are incremented by 1; `L` and `R` are the final values that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
