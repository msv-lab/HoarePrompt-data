The code provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the value of `n` will be reassigned to the integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, but this precondition is overwritten by the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, `n` is the input integer, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.**
