The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `A`. Given the initial state, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet. The new list `A` is created based on the input.

Output State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input.**
