Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input sorted in ascending order.**

Natural language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `A`) remain unchanged.
