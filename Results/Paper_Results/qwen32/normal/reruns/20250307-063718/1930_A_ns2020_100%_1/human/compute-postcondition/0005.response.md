Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer (but `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.
- `A` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Analysis:
- `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `A[::2]` is a slice that takes every second element from `A` starting from the first element (index 0). This means it will take elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than the length of `A`.
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

### Output Description:
The code will print the sum of every second element from the sorted list `A`, starting with the first element.

Since we don't have the exact values of `A`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `A`.

### Final Output:
Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the sorted list A (where A is the sorted list of integers read from the input)**
