Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `A`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
