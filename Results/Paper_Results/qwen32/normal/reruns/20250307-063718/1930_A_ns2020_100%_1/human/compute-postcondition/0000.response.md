The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the value of `t` will now be the integer input provided by the user, while the other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.**
