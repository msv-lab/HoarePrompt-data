Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer greater than 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `A` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Explanation:
- `A[::2]` is a slicing operation that selects every second element from the list `A` starting from the first element (index 0).
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Since `A` is sorted in ascending order, `A[::2]` will select the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which are the smallest elements at those positions in the sorted list.

### Output Description:
The output will be the sum of the elements at even indices of the list `A`, which is sorted in ascending order.

### Final Answer:
Output: **sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`**
