Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input sorted in ascending order.**

In simpler terms: The value of `t` has been decreased by 1, while `n`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.
