### Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to pair the smallest numbers together. By sorting the list, the smallest numbers are at the beginning, and by summing the numbers at even indices, we are effectively summing the minimum of each pair.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together.
2. **Summing Even Indices**: After sorting, the smallest number in each pair will be at an even index (0, 2, 4, ...). By summing these numbers, we are adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **First Test Case**: `1 2 3`
  - Sorted: `1 2 3`
  - Sum of even indices: `1` (minimum of (1, 2) and (3 is left out))
  - Output: `1`

- **Second Test Case**: `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
  - Sum of even indices: `1 + 1` (minimum of (1, 1) and (1, 2))
  - Output: `2`

- **Third Test Case**: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sum of even indices: `1 + 1 + 1` (minimum of (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1))
  - Output: `3`

The program correctly implements this strategy and produces the expected outputs for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem.
