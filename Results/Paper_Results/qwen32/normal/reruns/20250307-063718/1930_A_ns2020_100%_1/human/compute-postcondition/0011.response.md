To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. **`t`**: A non-zero integer. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n`**: A new input integer. This value is also not directly used in the provided print statement, so it can be ignored for this task.
3. **`a`**: A list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7. This list is not used in the provided print statement, so it can be ignored for this task.
4. **`A`**: A list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order. This list is used in the provided print statement.

The print statement `print(sum(A[::2]))` does the following:
- `A[::2]` slices the list `A` to get every second element starting from the first element (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...).
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Since `A` is sorted in ascending order, the elements at even indices will be the smaller elements in the list. The print statement will output the sum of these elements.

Given that the exact values of `A` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical sum. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`**
