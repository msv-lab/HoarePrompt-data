Reasoning: 

The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing a series of moves where each move involves choosing two numbers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and then removing those two numbers from the list. After `n` moves, the list will be empty, and we need to determine the maximum score that can be achieved.

The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest numbers together. This is because pairing the smallest numbers ensures that we are consistently adding the smallest possible values to the score, which is the goal since we want to maximize the score by adding the largest possible minimums.

The given program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `A` of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list `A`. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
4. It calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`). These elements represent the smallest numbers in each pair when the list is sorted.
5. It prints the calculated sum.
6. It decrements `t` and repeats the process for the next test case if any.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible values to the score, thus achieving the maximum possible score.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct.
