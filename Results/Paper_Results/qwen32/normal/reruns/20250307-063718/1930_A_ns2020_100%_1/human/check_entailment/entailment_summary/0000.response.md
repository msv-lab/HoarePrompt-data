### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller of the two to our score. After each selection, the two integers are removed from the list. This process is repeated exactly `n` times, where `n` is half the number of integers in the list.

The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because adding the smallest integer in each pair to the score will yield the highest possible score.

Here's how the provided program implements this strategy:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Scoring**: The program calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) of the sorted list. These are the smallest integers in each pair when the list is sorted.
4. **Output**: The calculated sum is printed as the score for that test case.

By sorting the list and summing the integers at even indices, the program effectively pairs the smallest integers together, thus maximizing the score as per the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
