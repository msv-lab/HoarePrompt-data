Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by performing the allowed moves optimally. Each move involves selecting two integers, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both from the board. The goal is to maximize the sum of these minimums over n moves.

The key insight here is that to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible, given the constraint that we must always choose the smallest remaining numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
4. **Summing Minimums**: By iterating over the sorted list and summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., `A[::2]`), the program effectively sums the smaller elements of each pair that would result from optimally pairing the numbers.
5. **Output**: The computed score for each test case is printed.

The algorithm works correctly because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums of these pairs.

Correctness: **True**
