The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`. This means that `A` will now hold the integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order as per the precondition.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is still a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input sorted in ascending order.**
