Output State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, and `A` is a list of integers read from the input sorted in ascending order.**

The list `A` has been sorted in ascending order, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
