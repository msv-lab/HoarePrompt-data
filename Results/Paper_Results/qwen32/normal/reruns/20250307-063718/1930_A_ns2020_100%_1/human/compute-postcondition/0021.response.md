Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (considering 0 as even), then prints this sum. The function repeats this process for all test cases specified by the input integer `t`.**
