Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after the operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.

Initial State: 
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is 0; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value; `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.

Since `list[i - 1]` is 0, the operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively becomes `list[i + 1] -= 0`, which means `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `list[i + 1]` does not change after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is 0; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value; `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.**

In simpler terms, the list remains unchanged in terms of the values specified, and `n` retains its value.
