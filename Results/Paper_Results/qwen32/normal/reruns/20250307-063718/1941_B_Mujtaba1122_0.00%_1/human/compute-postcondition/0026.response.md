The code snippet `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i + 1]` by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the expression `1 * list[i - 1]` evaluates to 0. Therefore, subtracting 0 from `list[i + 1]` does not change the value of `list[i + 1]`.

The values of `i`, `n`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged. The only variable that was initially specified as having a specific value (`list[i - 1]` being 0) is not affected in a way that changes its value in the output state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` remains the same**.
