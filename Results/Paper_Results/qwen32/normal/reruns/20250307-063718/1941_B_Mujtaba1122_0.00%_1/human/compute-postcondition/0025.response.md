The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `list[i - 1]` is 0. Therefore, `2 * list[i - 1]` equals 0, and `list[i]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from any number does not change its value.

The other variables and conditions provided in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` remains the same**.
