You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` modifies the first `n-2` elements of the input list to `0` by performing a series of operations, then checks a condition using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result. The remaining elements of the list beyond the `n-2` index remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i-1} \)
- Subtract 2 from \( a_i \)
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i+1} \)

The goal is to see if we can reduce all elements in the array to zero using this operation any number of times.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the operation described.

#### Issues in the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The operation in `func_2` is incorrectly implemented. The line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect because it subtracts the entire value of `list[i - 1]` from itself, making it zero. This is not the intended operation. The same issue applies to `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]`.
   
2. **Inefficiency and Incorrectness**:
   - The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i - 1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i + 1]` as long as `list[i] > 1` and the neighboring elements are positive. However, the current implementation does not correctly apply the operation multiple times.
   
3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The solution does not guarantee that the operation can be applied optimally to reduce the array to all zeros. It only attempts to apply the operation once per index, which is not sufficient in many cases.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can reduce the array to all zeros by applying the operation optimally. A key insight is that the operation can only be applied if the middle element is greater than 1 and its neighbors are positive. We need to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros by applying this operation in a way that ensures all elements can be made zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided solution, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
