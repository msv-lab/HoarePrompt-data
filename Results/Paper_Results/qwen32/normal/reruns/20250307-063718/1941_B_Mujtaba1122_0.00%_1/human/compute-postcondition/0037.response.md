To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head. The loop will continue to execute as long as all of the following conditions are true:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 4`
- `list[i - 1]` is 0
- `list[i]` is unchanged
- `list[i + 1]` is unchanged

We need to ensure that all conditions are met for the loop to continue. Let's analyze each condition:

1. **`list[i] > 1`**: This condition depends on the value of `list[i]`. Since `list[i]` is unchanged, we need to ensure that its value is greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

2. **`list[i - 1] > 0`**: This condition depends on the value of `list[i - 1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i - 1]` is 0, which does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than 0.

3. **`list[i + 1] > 0`**: This condition depends on the value of `list[i + 1]`. Since `list[i + 1]` is unchanged, we need to ensure that its value is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.

State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0**
