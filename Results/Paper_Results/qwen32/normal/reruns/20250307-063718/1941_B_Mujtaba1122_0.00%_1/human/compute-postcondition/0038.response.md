The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0 because subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself results in 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0**.
