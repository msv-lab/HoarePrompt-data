You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` modifies the first `n-2` elements of the input list to `0` by performing a series of operations, then checks a condition using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result. The remaining elements of the list beyond the `n-2` index remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the operation described should reduce `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the code incorrectly reduces them by multiples of `list[i-1]`. This will not achieve the intended effect of reducing the array elements to zero.

Let's break down the issue with the program:
- The operation should be: `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`.
- The code incorrectly performs: `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`.

This means that the code is not correctly simulating the described operation, and therefore, it will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 5`, `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- Correct operations:
  1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
  2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
  3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
  4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Incorrect operations performed by the code:
  - The first iteration of the while loop at `i=2` will incorrectly reduce the list to `[0, -3, 3, 5, 2]` (which is invalid since array elements cannot be negative and the operation is not correctly applied).
  
Thus, the code does not correctly simulate the described operation and will not always produce the correct answer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
