The value of `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i - 1]`. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the expression `2 * list[i - 1]` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `list[i]` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0**
