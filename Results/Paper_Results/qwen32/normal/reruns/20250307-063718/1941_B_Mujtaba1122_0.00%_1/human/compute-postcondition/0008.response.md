Initial State: `list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is now `0`; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value (specifically, `list[i] = list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`); `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`

The given code snippet is:
```
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

Given that `list[i - 1]` is `0`, the operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` simplifies to `list[i + 1] -= 0`, which means `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

The values of `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]` remain as they were, and `list[i + 1]` is not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is `0`; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value (specifically, `list[i] = list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`); `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`**
