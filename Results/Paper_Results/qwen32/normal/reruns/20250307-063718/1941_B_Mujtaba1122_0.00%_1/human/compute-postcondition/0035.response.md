The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the expression `2 * list[i - 1]` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `list[i]` remains unchanged.

The value of `i` is `i + 4`, but since this expression does not directly affect the value of `i` in the code snippet, it remains as `i + 4`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` is unchanged**.
