Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is now 0.
- `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value.
- `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.

The code snippet:
```
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
```

Since `list[i - 1]` is now 0, the expression `2 * list[i - 1]` evaluates to `0`. Therefore, the value of `list[i]` does not change.

Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state with no changes to `list[i]`.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is 0; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value; `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.**
