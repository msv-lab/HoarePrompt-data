To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and the given output states after specific iterations.

### Analysis of the Loop:
The loop condition is:
```python
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
```
The loop body is:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

### Initial State and Iteration States:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 4`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

2. **After 1st Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 4`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0
   - `list[i]` remains unchanged
   - `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged

3. **After 2nd Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 4`
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0
   - `list[i]` is unchanged
   - `list[i + 1]` is unchanged

4. **After 3rd Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 4`
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0
   - `list[i]` is greater than 1
   - `list[i + 1]` is greater than 0

### Observations:
- After the first iteration, `list[i - 1]` becomes 0, which means the loop will not execute again for the current `i` because the condition `list[i - 1] > 0` will fail.
- Since `i` is incremented by 4 after each iteration, the loop will start checking the new `i` value.
- The loop will only execute if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are all true.

### Final Output State:
- After the first iteration, `list[i - 1]` becomes 0, and the loop stops for the current `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 4, but since the loop condition fails for the new `i` (because `list[i - 1]` is 0), the loop does not execute further for any `i`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- `i` is `i + 4`
- `n` remains the same
- `list[i - 1]` is 0 (from the first iteration)
- `list[i]` remains unchanged from the first iteration
- `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged from the first iteration

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` remains the same, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` remains unchanged, `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations, the value of `i` will be `i + 4`, `n` will remain unchanged, `list[i - 1]` will be 0, and the values of `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` will be the same as they were after the first iteration of the loop.
