The code snippet `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the value at `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged because any number minus 0 is the number itself.

Therefore, the only thing that changes is the value at `list[i + 1]`, but since `list[i - 1]` is 0, there is no change to `list[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` is unchanged, `list[i + 1]` is unchanged**.
