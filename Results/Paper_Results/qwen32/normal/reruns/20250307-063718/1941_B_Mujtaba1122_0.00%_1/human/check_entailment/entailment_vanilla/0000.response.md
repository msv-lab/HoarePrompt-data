Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i-1} \)
- Subtract 2 from \( a_i \)
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i+1} \)

The goal is to see if we can reduce all elements in the array to zero using this operation any number of times.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the operation described.

#### Issues in the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The operation in `func_2` is incorrectly implemented. The line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect because it subtracts the entire value of `list[i - 1]` from itself, making it zero. This is not the intended operation. The same issue applies to `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]`.
   
2. **Inefficiency and Incorrectness**:
   - The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i - 1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i + 1]` as long as `list[i] > 1` and the neighboring elements are positive. However, the current implementation does not correctly apply the operation multiple times.
   
3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The solution does not guarantee that the operation can be applied optimally to reduce the array to all zeros. It only attempts to apply the operation once per index, which is not sufficient in many cases.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can reduce the array to all zeros by applying the operation optimally. A key insight is that the operation can only be applied if the middle element is greater than 1 and its neighbors are positive. We need to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros by applying this operation in a way that ensures all elements can be made zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided solution, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
