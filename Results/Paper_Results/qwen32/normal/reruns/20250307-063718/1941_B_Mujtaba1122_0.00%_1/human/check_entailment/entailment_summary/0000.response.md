Reasoning:

Let's analyze the functions and their behavior in the context of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correctly implemented for checking if the list is zeroed out.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates over the list from index 1 to `n-2` and applies the given operation while the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are satisfied.
   - The operation subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. However, this is incorrect because it should subtract 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not `list[i - 1]` times these values.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

The critical issue lies in the operation performed inside the `while` loop in `func_2`. The operation should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```
Instead, the current implementation incorrectly uses `list[i - 1]` as the multiplier. This will not correctly reduce the elements as intended by the problem description.

Given this incorrect operation, the program will not behave as expected and will not correctly determine if the array can be made zero using the described operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
