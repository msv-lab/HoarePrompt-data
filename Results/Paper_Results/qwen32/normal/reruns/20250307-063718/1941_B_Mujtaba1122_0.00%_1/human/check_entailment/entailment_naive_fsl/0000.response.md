Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the operation described should reduce `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the code incorrectly reduces them by multiples of `list[i-1]`. This will not achieve the intended effect of reducing the array elements to zero.

Let's break down the issue with the program:
- The operation should be: `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`.
- The code incorrectly performs: `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`.

This means that the code is not correctly simulating the described operation, and therefore, it will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 5`, `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- Correct operations:
  1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
  2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
  3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
  4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Incorrect operations performed by the code:
  - The first iteration of the while loop at `i=2` will incorrectly reduce the list to `[0, -3, 3, 5, 2]` (which is invalid since array elements cannot be negative and the operation is not correctly applied).
  
Thus, the code does not correctly simulate the described operation and will not always produce the correct answer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
