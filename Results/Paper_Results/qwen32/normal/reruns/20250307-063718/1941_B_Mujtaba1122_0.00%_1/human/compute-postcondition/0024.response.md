The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0 because it subtracts the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself.

Given the initial state, `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, and after the operation, it becomes 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` remains the same**.
