Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which aim to determine if it is possible to make all the elements of an array zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the correctness of these functions based on the problem statement.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Check if all elements in the list up to index `n-1` are zero.
- **Implementation**: Iterates through the list from index `0` to `n-1` and checks if any element is non-zero. If a non-zero element is found, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-zero element, it returns `True`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly checks if the first `n` elements of the list are zero. However, it does not ensure that the entire list is zero; it only checks up to the `n-1` index.

### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Modify the list using the specified operations and determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.
- **Implementation**:
  - Iterates through the list from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
  - For each index `i`, it performs the specified operations as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than `0`.
  - After modifying the list, it calls `func_1` to check if the first `n` elements are zero and prints "YES" if they are, otherwise "NO".
- **Correctness**:
  - The operations inside the loop are incorrect. The operations should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively. However, the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i-1]`, which is not the intended behavior.
  - Even if the operations were correct, the function only checks if the first `n` elements are zero after the modifications, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire list can be zeroed out.
  - The function does not handle cases where the operations cannot be performed (e.g., when `list[i]` is `1` or when `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is `0`), and it does not ensure that the entire list can be zeroed out.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation of `func_2` contains logical errors in the operations and does not correctly determine if the entire list can be zeroed out. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
