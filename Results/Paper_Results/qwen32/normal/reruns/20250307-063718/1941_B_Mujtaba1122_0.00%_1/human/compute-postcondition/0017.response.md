The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the value of `list[i]` does not change because subtracting twice 0 from any number results in the number itself.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1] > 0`**.
