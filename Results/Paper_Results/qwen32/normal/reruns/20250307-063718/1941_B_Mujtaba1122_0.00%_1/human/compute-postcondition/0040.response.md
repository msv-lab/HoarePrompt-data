The code snippet `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i + 1]` by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the value of `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from any number does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `list[i + 1]` is still greater than 0 as per the precondition.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `i` is still `i + 4`
- `list[i - 1]` is still 0
- `list[i]` is still greater than 1

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` is greater than 1, `list[i + 1]` is greater than 0**
