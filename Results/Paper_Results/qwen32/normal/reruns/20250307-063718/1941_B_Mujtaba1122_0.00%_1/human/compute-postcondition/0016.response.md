The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0, as subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself results in 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1] > 0`**
