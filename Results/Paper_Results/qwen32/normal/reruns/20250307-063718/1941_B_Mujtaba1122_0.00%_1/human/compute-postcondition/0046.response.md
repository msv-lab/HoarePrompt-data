The given initial state describes the state of a list and a function, but the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the list or the function. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the list and the function `func_1`, but these details are not relevant to the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
