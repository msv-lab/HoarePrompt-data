The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `list[i - 1]` is 0, so `2 * list[i - 1]` is 0. This means `list[i]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from it does not alter its value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1] > 0`**.
