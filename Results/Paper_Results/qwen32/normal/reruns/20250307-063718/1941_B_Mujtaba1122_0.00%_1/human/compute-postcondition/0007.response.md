Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is now `0`; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value (specifically, `list[i] = list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`); `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`**

In simpler terms: The value of `list[i]` has been updated to be its previous value minus twice the value of `list[i - 1]`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
