The code snippet provided is `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `list[i - 1]` is 0. Therefore, the operation `1 * list[i - 1]` results in 0, and subtracting 0 from `list[i + 1]` does not change the value of `list[i + 1]`.

Thus, the only variable that could have been affected is `list[i + 1]`, but since `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` remains the same, `list[i + 4] > 1`, `list[i + 3] > 0`, `list[i + 5] > 0`, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` remains unchanged, `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged.**
