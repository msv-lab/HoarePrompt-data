To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop head condition is:
```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` remains the same
- `list[i] > 1`
- `list[i - 1]` is 0
- `list[i + 1]` remains the same

For the loop to execute one more time, all conditions in the `while` loop must be satisfied:
1. `list[i] > 1` - This condition is already satisfied.
2. `list[i - 1] > 0` - This condition is not satisfied because `list[i - 1]` is 0.
3. `list[i + 1] > 0` - This condition is already satisfied.

To satisfy the second condition (`list[i - 1] > 0`), we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than 0.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` remains the same**
