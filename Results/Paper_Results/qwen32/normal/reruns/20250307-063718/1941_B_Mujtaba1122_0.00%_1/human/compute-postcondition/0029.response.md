To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the conditions in the loop head are satisfied. The loop head conditions are:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `i` is `i + 4`
- `n` remains the same

This implies that `i` has already been incremented by 4 before the loop starts.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `list[i] > 1`**:
   - Since `i` is `i + 4`, we need to ensure that the element at index `i + 4` in the list is greater than 1.

2. **Condition `list[i - 1] > 0`**:
   - Given `i` is `i + 4`, the element at index `i + 3` in the list must be greater than 0.

3. **Condition `list[i + 1] > 0`**:
   - Given `i` is `i + 4`, the element at index `i + 5` in the list must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments:

To satisfy these conditions, we need to ensure that:
- `list[i + 4] > 1`
- `list[i + 3] > 0`
- `list[i + 5] > 0`

Since `i` is `i + 4`, we can denote the current value of `i` (before the increment) as `i_current`. Therefore, the conditions translate to:
- `list[i_current + 8] > 1`
- `list[i_current + 7] > 0`
- `list[i_current + 9] > 0`

### Final State:

Given the conditions above, the state right before the `while` loop should be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is `i + 4`
- `n` remains the same
- `list[i + 4]` must be greater than 1
- `list[i + 3]` must be greater than 0
- `list[i + 5]` must be greater than 0

State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` remains the same, `list[i + 4] > 1`, `list[i + 3] > 0`, `list[i + 5] > 0`**
