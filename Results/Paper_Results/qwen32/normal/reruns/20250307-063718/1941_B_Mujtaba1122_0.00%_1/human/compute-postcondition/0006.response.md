The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to `0` because subtracting `list[i - 1]` from itself results in `0`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0`.
- `list[i - 1] > 0` for some `i` in the range `1` to `n`.
- `list[i] > 1`.
- `list[i + 1] > 0`.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.

After executing the code, `list[i - 1]` is set to `0`. The other elements of the list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is now `0`; `list[i]` is greater than `1`; `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`**.
