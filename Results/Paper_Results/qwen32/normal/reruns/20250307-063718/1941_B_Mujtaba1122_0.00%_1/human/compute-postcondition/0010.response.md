The given code snippet modifies the value of `list[i - 1]` by subtracting its current value from itself, effectively setting it to 0. This impacts the initial state by changing the value of `list[i - 1]` to 0. The other conditions and values of the list and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is now 0; `list[i]` is greater than `1` minus twice its previous value; `list[i + 1]` is greater than `0` and remains unchanged; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.**
