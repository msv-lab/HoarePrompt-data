To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues as long as:
- `list[i] > 1`
- `list[i - 1] > 0`
- `list[i + 1] > 0`

Inside the loop:
- `list[i - 1]` is decremented by `1 * list[i - 1]`, effectively setting it to `0`.
- `list[i]` is decremented by `2 * list[i - 1]`, which is `0` because `list[i - 1]` has just been set to `0`.
- `list[i + 1]` is decremented by `1 * list[i - 1]`, which is `0` because `list[i - 1]` has just been set to `0`.

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **After 1st iteration:**
   - `list[i - 1]` becomes `0`.
   - `list[i]` remains the same because `2 * list[i - 1]` is `0`.
   - `list[i + 1]` remains the same because `1 * list[i - 1]` is `0`.
   - The loop condition `list[i - 1] > 0` fails, so the loop does not execute again with this `i`.

2. **After 2nd iteration:**
   - `i` has been incremented by `1` from the previous iteration.
   - The same process occurs: `list[i - 1]` is set to `0`, and `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
   - The loop condition `list[i - 1] > 0` fails, so the loop does not execute again with this `i`.

3. **After 3rd iteration:**
   - `i` has been incremented by `1` from the previous iteration.
   - The same process occurs: `list[i - 1]` is set to `0`, and `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
   - The loop condition `list[i - 1] > 0` fails, so the loop does not execute again with this `i`.

### Conclusion:
From the above analysis, it is clear that after each iteration, `list[i - 1]` is set to `0`, which causes the loop condition to fail, preventing further iterations with the same `i`. Therefore, the loop will only execute as long as `list[i - 1] > 0` before each iteration.

### Final Output State:
Given that `list[i - 1]` becomes `0` after each iteration, and the loop does not execute further with the same `i` once this happens, the final state after all iterations is:
- `i` is incremented by `1` for each iteration where the loop condition holds.
- `list[i - 1]` is `0` after each iteration.
- `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged after each iteration.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `n` remains the same, `list[i - 3]` is `0`, `list[i - 2]` is `0`, `list[i - 1]` is `0`, `list[i] > 1`, `list[i + 1] > 0`**

In natural language: After all iterations, `i` has been incremented by 3, `n` remains unchanged, and the elements at positions `i-3`, `i-2`, and `i-1` in the list are all `0`. The elements at positions `i` and `i+1` remain unchanged and satisfy the conditions `list[i] > 1` and `list[i + 1] > 0`.
