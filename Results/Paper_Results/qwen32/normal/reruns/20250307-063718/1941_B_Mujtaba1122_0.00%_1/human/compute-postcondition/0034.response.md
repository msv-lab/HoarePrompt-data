The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0 since subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself results in 0. The value of `i` remains `i + 4` as it is not modified in the code snippet. The condition that `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0 is no longer applicable after the operation since `list[i - 1]` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` is 0**
