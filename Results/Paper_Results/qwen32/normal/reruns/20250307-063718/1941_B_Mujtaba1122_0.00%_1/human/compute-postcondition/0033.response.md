To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `i` is `i + 4`
- `n` remains the same (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `list[i + 4] > 1`
- `list[i + 3] > 0`
- `list[i + 5] > 0`
- `list[i - 1]` is 0
- `list[i]` remains unchanged
- `list[i + 1]` remains unchanged

The conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute again are:
1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the current state:
- `list[i - 1]` is 0, which does not satisfy the second condition (`list[i - 1] > 0`).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than 0. The other conditions (`list[i] > 1` and `list[i + 1] > 0`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not mentioned to be problematic in the current state.

State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0**
