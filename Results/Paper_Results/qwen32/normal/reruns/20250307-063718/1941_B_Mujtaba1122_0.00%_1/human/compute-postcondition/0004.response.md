The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of `list[i + 1]` by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. The precondition specifies that `list[i - 1]` is `0` for some `i` in the range `1` to `n`. Given that `list[i - 1]` is `0`, the operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively does nothing because subtracting `0` from any number leaves the number unchanged.

Therefore, the values of `list[i + 1]` and `list[i - 1]` remain the same, and the other elements of the list and the variable `n` are also unaffected.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where `list[0] > 0`, `list[1] > 1`, and `list[2] > 0` except that `list[i - 1]` is `0` for some `i` in the range `1` to `n`; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list)**.
