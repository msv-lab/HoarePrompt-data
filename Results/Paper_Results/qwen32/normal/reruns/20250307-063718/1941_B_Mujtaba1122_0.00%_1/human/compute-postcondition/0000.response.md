To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`, which means the loop variable is `i`, and the range depends on `n`.

Let's analyze the conditions required for the loop to execute:

1. **Range Condition**: The `range(1, n - 1)` will generate values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means `1 < n - 1` must be true, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

2. **Given Condition**: We are also given that `3 <= n <= len(list)`. This condition is already more restrictive than `n > 2` and ensures that the range will have at least one value.

3. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The variable `i` does not need to be initialized before the loop starts since it is defined by the `range` function within the loop head.

4. **List Condition**: The list being a list of non-negative integers is already provided and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is within the range `[3, len(list)]`. Since the problem specifies that `3 <= n <= len(list)`, this condition is already met, and no further adjustments to `n` are necessary.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need to be changed with respect to the loop head variables.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list)**
