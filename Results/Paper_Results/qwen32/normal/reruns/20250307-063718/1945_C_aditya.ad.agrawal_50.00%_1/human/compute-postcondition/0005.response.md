The code snippet `z = arr.count(0)` counts the number of occurrences of the integer `0` in the list `arr`. Given that `arr` is derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form, `z` will hold the count of '0's in the string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is the value of the next input; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`.**
