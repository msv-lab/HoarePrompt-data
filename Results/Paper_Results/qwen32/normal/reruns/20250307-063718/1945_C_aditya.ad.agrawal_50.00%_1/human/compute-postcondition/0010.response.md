The code snippet provided initializes `o_l` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, and `z_l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is the value of the next input; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0.**
