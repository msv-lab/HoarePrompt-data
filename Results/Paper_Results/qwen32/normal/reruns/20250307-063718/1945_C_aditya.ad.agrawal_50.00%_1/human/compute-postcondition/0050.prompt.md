Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is the value of the next input; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 1; If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r` plus 1 if `i` is 0, or if `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r` if `i` is not 0, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 2; `i` is the next element in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 2, `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 2, and `o_l` is 0. Otherwise, `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 2, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 1; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 3; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `z_l` and `z_r` are adjusted based on whether `i` is 0; `o_l` and `o_r` are adjusted based on whether `i` is not 0; if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is set to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
