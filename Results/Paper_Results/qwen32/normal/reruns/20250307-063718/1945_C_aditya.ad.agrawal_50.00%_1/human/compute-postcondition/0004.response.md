The code snippet converts the `input_string` into a list of integers, where each character in `input_string` is converted to its integer form. This means if `input_string` is a string of '0's and '1's, `arr` will be a list of corresponding integers 0 and 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `arr`, which is newly assigned based on `input_string`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is the value of the next input; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form.**
