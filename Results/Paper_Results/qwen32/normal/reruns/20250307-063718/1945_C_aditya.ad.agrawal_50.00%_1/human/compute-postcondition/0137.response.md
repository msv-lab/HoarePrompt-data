Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`. If `i` is 0, `z` (count of 0s in `arr`) is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o` (count of 1s in `arr`) is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is `pos`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is now equal to the value of `pos`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
