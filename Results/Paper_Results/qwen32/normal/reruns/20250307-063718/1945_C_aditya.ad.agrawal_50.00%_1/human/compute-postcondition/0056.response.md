The code snippet converts each character in `input_string` to an integer and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `input_string` is also not altered but is used to create `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer.**
