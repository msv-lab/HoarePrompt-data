The code snippet initializes three new variables: `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. The values of these variables are calculated as follows:

- `dist` is assigned the value of `abs(n / 2)`, which is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.
- `pos` is initialized to 0.

The other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`) are not modified by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0.**
