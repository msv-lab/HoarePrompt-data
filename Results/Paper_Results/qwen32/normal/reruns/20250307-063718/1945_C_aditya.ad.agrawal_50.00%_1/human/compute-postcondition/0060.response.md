The code snippet `o_r = o` assigns the value of `o` to `o_r`. The variables `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, and `z_r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `o_r` now holds the same value as `o`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is equal to `o`.**
