Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr` plus 1, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`**

In natural language: The variable `o_l` is incremented by 1, so the count of 1s in `arr` (previously stored in `o`) is now increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
