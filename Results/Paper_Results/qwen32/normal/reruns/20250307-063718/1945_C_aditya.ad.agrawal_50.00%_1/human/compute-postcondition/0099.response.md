Postcondition: **`i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to the value of `pos` and `b_d` is updated to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1.**
