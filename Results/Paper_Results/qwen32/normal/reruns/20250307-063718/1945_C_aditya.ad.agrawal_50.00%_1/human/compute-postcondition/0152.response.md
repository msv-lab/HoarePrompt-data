The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Given that `t` is initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in Python, the value of `t` will become `0` after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was last met, `t` is 0, `b_d` is the smallest distance from the middle of the array where the condition was met.**
