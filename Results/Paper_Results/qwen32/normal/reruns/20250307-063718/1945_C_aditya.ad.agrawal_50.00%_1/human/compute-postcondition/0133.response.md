Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `z_l` is incremented by 1, `z_r` is decremented by 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `z_r` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as provided in the initial state.
