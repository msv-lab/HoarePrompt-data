The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 1; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 1; If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001; `i` is 0**.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `z_l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
