The code `z_r = z` assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**
