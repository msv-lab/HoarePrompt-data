Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.**
