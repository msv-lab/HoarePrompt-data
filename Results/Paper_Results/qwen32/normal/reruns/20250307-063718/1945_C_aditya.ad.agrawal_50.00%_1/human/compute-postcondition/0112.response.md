Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met, `t` is `True`**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that `o_l` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified.
