The given code snippet updates the variable `b_d` based on the current values of `n` and `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged unless the subsequent conditions are met, which are not part of the provided code snippet.

Here's the output state after the execution of the given line of code:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is `pos`.**

In simple terms, the variable `b_d` has been updated to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. All other variables remain in their previously defined states.
