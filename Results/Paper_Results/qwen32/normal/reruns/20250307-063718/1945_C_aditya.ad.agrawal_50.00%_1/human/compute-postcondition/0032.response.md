The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Given the initial state, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0. After the increment, if `z_l` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `z_l` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 2 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1; `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 2; `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
