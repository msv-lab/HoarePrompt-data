The code increments the value of `pos` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`**

In simpler terms, the value of `pos` is increased by 1, and the value of `i` is updated to the element in `arr` at the new `pos` index. All other variables retain their initial values.
