Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 2; `i` is the next element in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 2, `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 2, and `o_l` is 0. Otherwise, `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 2, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 1.**
