The code snippet `b_d = 30001` directly assigns the value `30001` to the variable `b_d`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is 30001, and `t` is `True`.**
