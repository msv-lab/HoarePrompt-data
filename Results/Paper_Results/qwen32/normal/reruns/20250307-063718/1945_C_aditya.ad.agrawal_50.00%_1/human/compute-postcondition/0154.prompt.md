Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is the length of the input string; `a` is the input string of '0's and '1's; `input_string` is the same as `a`; `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of '0's in `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of '0's in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of '1's in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is `n`; `ans` is the last position where the conditions were met; `b_d` is the smallest distance from `n / 2` where the conditions were met.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was last met, `t` is 0, `b_d` is the smallest distance from the middle of the array where the condition was met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
