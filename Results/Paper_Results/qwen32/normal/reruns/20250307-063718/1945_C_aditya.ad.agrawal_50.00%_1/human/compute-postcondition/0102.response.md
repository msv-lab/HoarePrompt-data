The provided code snippet is `t -= 1`. However, the initial state does not include a variable `t`. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the impact of this operation on the given initial state as `t` is not defined. 

If we assume that `t` was supposed to be part of the initial state, the operation would simply decrement the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is not mentioned in the initial state, I will assume there might have been a mistake, and I'll proceed by describing the state as it is, without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met.**
