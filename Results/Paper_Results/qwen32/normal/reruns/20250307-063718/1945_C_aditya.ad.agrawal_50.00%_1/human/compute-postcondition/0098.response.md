Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the value of `pos`; If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1; `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

Explanation in natural language: The variable `b_d` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions, with `pos` having been incremented by 1 and `ans` updated to the new value of `pos`. The conditions for updating `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` based on the value of `i` remain unchanged.
