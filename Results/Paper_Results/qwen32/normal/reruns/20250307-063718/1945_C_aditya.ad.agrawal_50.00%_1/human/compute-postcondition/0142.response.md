The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `dist`, `pos`, `t`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `z_l` is `z_l + 1`.**
