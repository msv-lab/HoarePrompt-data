The code snippet `o_r = o` assigns the value of `o` to `o_r`. The variable `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`, and `o_r` is now also equal to this count. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is the value of the next input; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`.**
