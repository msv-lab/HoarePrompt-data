Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 1; If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r` plus 1 if `i` is 0, or if `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r` if `i` is not 0, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
