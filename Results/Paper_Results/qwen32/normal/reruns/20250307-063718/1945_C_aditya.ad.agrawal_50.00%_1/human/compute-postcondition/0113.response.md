The code snippet provided reassigns values to `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. Specifically, `dist` is reassigned to `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is set to 0, and `pos` is also set to 0. The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met, `t` is `True`.**
