The code snippet provided is:

```python
z_r -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `z_r`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 3; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `z_l` is incremented by 1; `z_r` is decremented by 1.**
