Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `input_string` is a string input by the user.
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer.
- `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.
- `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.
- `z_r` is initialized to 0.
- `o_r` is initialized to 0.
- `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`.
- `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`.
- `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.
- `pos` is the length of `arr`.
- `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met.
- `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met.

### Key Observations:
- `z_l` and `z` both represent the count of 0s in `arr`.
- `o_l` and `o` both represent the count of 1s in `arr`.
- `ans` is initialized to 0 and will only change if a specific condition is met during the execution of the code (which is not provided here).

Since the code snippet only contains the `print(ans)` statement and no other code that modifies `ans`, we can infer that `ans` remains 0 unless some other part of the code (not shown) changes its value. However, based on the provided initial state, `ans` is not modified.

### Conclusion:
Given that `ans` is initialized to 0 and there is no code provided that changes its value, the `print(ans)` statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
