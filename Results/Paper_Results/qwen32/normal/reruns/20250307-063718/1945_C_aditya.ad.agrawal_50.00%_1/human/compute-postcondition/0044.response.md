The code snippet provided increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `o_l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it was initialized to some integer value before this line of code was executed. After executing `o_l += 1`, the value of `o_l` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 3; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `o_l` is increased by 1.**
