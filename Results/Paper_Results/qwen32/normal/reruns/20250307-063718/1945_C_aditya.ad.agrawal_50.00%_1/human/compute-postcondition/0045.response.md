The code snippet provided is `o_r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` where each character is converted to its integer form and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `a`; `o` is the count of '1's in the list `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `pos` is 3; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `o_l` is increased by 1; `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
