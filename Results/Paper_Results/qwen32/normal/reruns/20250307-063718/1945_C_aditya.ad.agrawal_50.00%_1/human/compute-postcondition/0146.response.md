Postcondition: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`. If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is `z_l + 1` and `z_r` is `z_r - 1`. Otherwise, `o_l` is `o_l + 1` and `o_r` is `o_r - 1`.**
