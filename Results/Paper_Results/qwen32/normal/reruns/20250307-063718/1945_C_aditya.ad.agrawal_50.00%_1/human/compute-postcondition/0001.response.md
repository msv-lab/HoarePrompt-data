The `while` loop in the provided code will execute as long as the condition `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that `t` is described as "an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4," it is already guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Since `n` and `a` are not part of the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop can remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'**
