The given code snippet updates the `arr` variable by converting each character in `input_string` to an integer and storing these integers in a list. This means that `arr` will now hold the integer values corresponding to each character in `input_string`.

Given the initial state, the values of `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `pos`, `ans`, and `b_d` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet. The variable `t` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met, `t` is `True`**.
