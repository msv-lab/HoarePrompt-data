Postcondition: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 2`, `t` is `True`, `i` is `arr[pos]`. If `i` is 0, `z` (count of 0s in `arr`) is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o` (count of 1s in `arr`) is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged.**
