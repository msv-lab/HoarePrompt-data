The code snippet `z_r = z` assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The value of `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `z_r` now holds the same value as `z`.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition was first met or 0 if never met, and `b_d` is the minimum distance from the midpoint where the condition was met or its initial value if never met, `t` is `True`**.
