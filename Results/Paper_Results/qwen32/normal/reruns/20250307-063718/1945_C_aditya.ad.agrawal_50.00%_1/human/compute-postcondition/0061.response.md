The code snippet provided initializes `z_l` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, and `o_r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0.**
