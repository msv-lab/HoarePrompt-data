The code snippet `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of times the integer `1` appears in the list `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, and `z`) are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**
