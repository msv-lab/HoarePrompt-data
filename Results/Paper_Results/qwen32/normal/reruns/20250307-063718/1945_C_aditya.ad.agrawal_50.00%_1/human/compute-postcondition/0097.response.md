The provided Python code snippet assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. No other operations are performed on `pos`, `i`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, or `o_r` that would change their values. Therefore, the values of `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `ans` now holds the value of `pos`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the value of `pos`; If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1.**
