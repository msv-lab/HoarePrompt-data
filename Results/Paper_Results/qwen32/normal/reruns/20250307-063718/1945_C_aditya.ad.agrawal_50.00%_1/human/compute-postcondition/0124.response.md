The code snippet `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `True`. If `o_r` (original count of 1s in `arr` minus 1) is greater than or equal to `(z_r + (o_r + 1)) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
