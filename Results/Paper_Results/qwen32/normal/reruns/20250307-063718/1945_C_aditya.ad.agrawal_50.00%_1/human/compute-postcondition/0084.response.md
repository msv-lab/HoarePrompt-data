The code snippet provided increments the variable `o_l` by 1. No other variables are modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains 0 and no other variables are updated, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `o_l` is `o_l + 1`.**
