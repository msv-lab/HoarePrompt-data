The code snippet `z = arr.count(0)` counts the number of times the integer `0` appears in the list `arr`. The values of `n` and `input_string` remain unchanged, but `z` is assigned the count of `0`s in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**
