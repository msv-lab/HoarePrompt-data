Postcondition: **`n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to an integer and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `t` is `True`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0. Otherwise, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
