Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the current indices of strings `a` and `b` respectively, such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b); `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]` or `-1` if `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`. `index` is `-1`**
