Precondition: **a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers representing the current indices of strings a and b respectively, such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).** 

However, based on the problem description and the function definition provided, it seems that `i` and `j` are not part of the input for each test case but rather are used internally within the function to track the current position in the strings `a` and `b`. Therefore, a more accurate precondition focusing on the input for each test case would be:

Precondition: **a and b are binary strings, n is the length of string a, and m is the length of string b, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5.**
