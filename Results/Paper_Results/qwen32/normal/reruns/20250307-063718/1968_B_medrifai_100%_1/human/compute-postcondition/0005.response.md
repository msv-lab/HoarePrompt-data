Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the current indices of strings `a` and `b` respectively. The function returns the position of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from index `j`, the function returns -1.**
