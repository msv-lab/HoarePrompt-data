Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer representing the length of array `a` and must be greater than `m`, `m` is an integer representing the length of array `b`, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` integers of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of integers that are common in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is in `b_freq`.**
