The code snippet initializes a variable `good_subarrays` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, or `m`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer representing the length of array `a`, and `m` is an integer representing the length of array `b`; `good_subarrays` is 0.**
