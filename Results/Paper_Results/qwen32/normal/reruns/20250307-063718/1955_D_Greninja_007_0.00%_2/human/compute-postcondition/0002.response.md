Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer representing the length of array `a`, `m` is an integer representing the length of array `b`, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` integers of `a`.**

In natural language: The variable `window_freq` is now a Counter object that holds the frequency of each integer in the first `m` integers of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
