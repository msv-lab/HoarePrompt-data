The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the range `n - m`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, the state must be adjusted such that `n - m` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be greater than `m`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer representing the length of array `a` and must be greater than `m`, `m` is an integer representing the length of array `b`, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` integers of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of integers that are common in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`**
