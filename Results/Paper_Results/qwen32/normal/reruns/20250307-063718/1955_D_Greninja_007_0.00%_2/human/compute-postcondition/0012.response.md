Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is the length of array `a` and must be greater than `m`, `m` is the length of array `b`, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` integers of `a` except for the integer `a[i]` which has a count of 0, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of integers that are common in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` (potentially adjusted), `good_subarrays` is 1 if `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `good_subarrays` remains 0. The current value of `window_freq[a[i]]` is 0.**
