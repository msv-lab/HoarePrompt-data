To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided loop and the given output states after the first 3 iterations. 

The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, multiplying each element with a temporary variable `tem` and appending the result to the list `ans`.

- **Initial State:** 
  - `arr` is a list of integers.
  - `ans` is an empty list.
  - `tem` is 1.

- **Loop Code:**
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
      tem *= arr[i]
      ans.append(tem)
  ```

- **Output State after 1 iteration:**
  - `ans` contains the last element of `arr`.
  - `tem` is the last element of `arr`.
  - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.

- **Output State after 2 iterations:**
  - `ans` contains the last element of `arr` followed by the product of the last two elements of `arr`.
  - `tem` is the product of the last two elements of `arr`.
  - `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

- **Output State after 3 iterations:**
  - `ans` contains the last element of `arr`, the product of the last two elements, and the product of the last three elements.
  - `tem` is the product of the last three elements.
  - `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, the loop will have processed all elements of `arr` in reverse order. Therefore, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first. `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` will be `-1` (indicating that the loop has finished).

**Output State:** `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**
