In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to `0`. 

The loop head contains the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and the range parameters `-1` and `-1`. However, since `len(arr)` is a function of the list `arr` itself, and the range parameters are constants, the only variable we can adjust directly to ensure the loop executes is `i`.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element because the range function requires a non-empty list to have a valid starting index (`len(arr) - 1`).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `arr` has at least one element, and `i` should be set to the starting index of the loop, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
