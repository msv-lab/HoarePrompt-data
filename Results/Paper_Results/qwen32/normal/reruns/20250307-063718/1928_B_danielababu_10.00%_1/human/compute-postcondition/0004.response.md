The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Since `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, the last element of `arr` is added to `ans`. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
