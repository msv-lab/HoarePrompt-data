The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of its current value and the value of `arr[i]`. Given that `tem` is initially `arr[len(arr) - 1]` and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is now `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`. The values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**.
