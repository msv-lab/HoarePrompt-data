To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, `i` should be `len(arr) - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `tem`) are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**
