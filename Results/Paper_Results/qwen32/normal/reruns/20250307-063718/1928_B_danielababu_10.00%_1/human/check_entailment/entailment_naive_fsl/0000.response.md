Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`), but it does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires implementing a function to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to it. None of the provided functions address this requirement.

To solve the problem, we need to implement a function that processes each test case by analyzing the array and determining the optimal permutation to maximize the frequency of any single element in the modified array. The provided code does not include such a function, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
