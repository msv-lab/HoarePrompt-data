The code multiplies the variable `tem` by the element at index `i` of the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is initially 1, and `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `tem` will now hold the value of the last element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
