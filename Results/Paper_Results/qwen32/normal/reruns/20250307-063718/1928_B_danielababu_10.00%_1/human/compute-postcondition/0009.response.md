`tem` is multiplied by `arr[i]`, where `i` is `len(arr) - 3`. This means `tem` is updated to its current value times the element at index `len(arr) - 3` in `arr`. The values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `i` remains `len(arr) - 3`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`; `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**.
