The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The value of `tem` is the product of the last three elements of `arr`. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now includes the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`, and then `tem` is appended again.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem` and then `tem` again; `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**.
