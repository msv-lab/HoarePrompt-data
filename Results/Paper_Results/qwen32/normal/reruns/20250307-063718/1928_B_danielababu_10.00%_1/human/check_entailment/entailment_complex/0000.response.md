### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array. The provided code attempts to solve this problem by calculating a new array `new` where each element is transformed according to the formula `m - arr[i] + 1`, where `m` is the maximum element in the original array `arr`. This transformation is intended to align the highest possible values of the permutation with the elements of the array in a way that maximizes the frequency of any single value in the modified array.

The subsequent steps involve sorting the `new` array and then filtering out values that are within the range [1, n], adding these to a set `ans`, and finally printing the size of this set. The size of the set `ans` represents the number of distinct positions in the permutation that can be used to maximize the frequency of any element in the modified array.

However, the logic in the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The approach of transforming the array and counting distinct values within a certain range does not guarantee the maximum frequency of any single element in the modified array. Instead, the correct approach involves understanding that the maximum frequency of any element in the modified array is limited by the number of distinct values that can be achieved through the addition of a permutation. Specifically, the maximum frequency is `n` if it is possible to make all elements equal, but this is only possible if the range of the transformed array fits within the range of the permutation.

A correct approach would involve checking if the range of the transformed array (after adding the permutation) can fit within the range [1, n + max(arr)], and then determining the maximum frequency of any element in the modified array. The provided code does not follow this logic and thus does not correctly solve the problem.
