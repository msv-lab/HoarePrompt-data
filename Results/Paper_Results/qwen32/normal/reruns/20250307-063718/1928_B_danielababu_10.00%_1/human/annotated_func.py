#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns an integer that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_2` does not have any parameters and is expected to read input from standard input, which is then split into integers and returned as a map object.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers from the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into components based on spaces, converts each component into an integer, and returns these integers as a map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string from the user, splits the string into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string is expected to contain space-separated values that can be converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated string of integer values from the input, converts these values into integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, thus no specific precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains string representations of the elements from the input list, where the input list is formed by splitting the input string based on whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into a string (which is redundant since they are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_6` does not take any parameters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function `func_6`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_7` does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which is expected to be a single line of space-separated strings.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of space-separated strings read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single line of space-separated strings from standard input, sorts these strings, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):

    #State: `ans` is a list where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in `arr` from index `0` to `i`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in `arr` from index `0` to `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in the input list from index `0` to `i`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    #State: `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
