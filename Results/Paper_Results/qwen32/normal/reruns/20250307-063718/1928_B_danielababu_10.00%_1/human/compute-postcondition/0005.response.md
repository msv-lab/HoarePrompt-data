The only variables in the loop head are `i`, which is the loop variable, and the range function parameters `len(arr) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1` (start, stop, and step respectively). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently `len(arr) - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(arr) - 2`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
