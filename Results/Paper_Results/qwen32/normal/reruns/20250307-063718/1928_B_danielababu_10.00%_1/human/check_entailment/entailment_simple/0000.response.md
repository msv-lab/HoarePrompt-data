### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read the number of test cases and the size of each array `n`.
   - It uses `func_3()` to read the array `arr` for each test case.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value in the Array:**
   - The program finds the maximum value `m` in the array `arr`.

3. **Creating the `new` Array:**
   - The program creates a new array `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - This transformation is meant to map the values of `arr` in such a way that the highest possible values in `arr` become the smallest possible values in `new` and vice versa, with a shift to ensure all values are positive.

4. **Sorting the `new` Array:**
   - The program sorts the `new` array.

5. **Finding the Set of Valid Indices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted `new` array and checks if each element is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
   - If it is, the element is added to the set `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the size of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

### Analysis of the Logic:

The key idea here is to transform the array such that the problem of finding the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation can be solved by finding the number of unique valid indices in the transformed array.

However, the current implementation has a flaw. The transformation of the array and the subsequent logic to find the maximum frequency do not correctly solve the problem. The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` does not ensure that the maximum frequency of any element can be correctly determined by the number of unique valid indices in the sorted `new` array.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for transforming the array and determining the maximum frequency is flawed.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to consider the following:

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.

2. **Determine Maximum Frequency:**
   - The maximum frequency of any element in the array can be increased by adding a permutation to the array.
   - The maximum possible frequency of any element after adding a permutation is `min(n, max_frequency + n - 1)`, where `max_frequency` is the current maximum frequency of any element in the array.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Use a dictionary or a `collections.Counter` to count the frequencies of elements in the array.
   - Find the maximum frequency.
   - Calculate the maximum possible frequency after adding a permutation.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct and efficient.
