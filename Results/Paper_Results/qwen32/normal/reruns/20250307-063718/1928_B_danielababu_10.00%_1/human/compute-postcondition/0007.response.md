The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. 

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `ans` initially contains the last element of `arr`.
- `tem` is the product of the last two elements of `arr`.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

After running `ans.append(tem)`, `ans` will now contain the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `tem`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**
