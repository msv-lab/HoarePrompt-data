The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `i` is still not initialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `i` is not yet initialized; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
