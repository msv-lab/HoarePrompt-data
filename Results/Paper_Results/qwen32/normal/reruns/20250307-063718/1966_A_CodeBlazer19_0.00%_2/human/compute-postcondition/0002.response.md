The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still not initialized as it is supposed to be initialized by the loop head, which is not part of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `i` is not yet initialized.**
