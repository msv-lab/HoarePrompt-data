You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `c` of `n` integers. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left depends on the distribution of card numbers and the value of `k`.

Let's analyze why the given program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations any number of times. The operations involve exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left.

2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves focusing on the most frequent card numbers. If a card number appears `m` times, you can reduce the count of that card number by `k` and increase it by `k-1` in each operation. The net effect is reducing the count by `1` for every `k` cards of the same number. Therefore, the minimum number of cards left for a particular number is `m % k`.

3. **General Strategy**: For each test case, count the frequency of each card number, compute `m % k` for each frequency `m`, and sum these values. This sum represents the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case with input `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`, the frequencies are `4` for number `4` and `2` for number `1`. The minimum number of cards left is `(4 % 3) + (2 % 3) = 1 + 2 = 3`, but since we can combine operations, the optimal sequence leads to `2` cards left.
   - The given program outputs `2` for this case, which is correct by chance but not because of the implemented logic.

Given the above points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. It simply outputs `k - 1` for each test case, which is not always correct.

Correctness: **False**
