To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, we need to identify the value of `k` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.

### Key Information:
- The value of `k` is determined by the input, but it is not explicitly stated what the value of `k` is. However, we know that `k` is an integer.
- The `print` statement is `print(k - 1)`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `k - 1`.
- Since we do not have the exact value of `k` from the problem statement, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k - 1)` statement will output the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
