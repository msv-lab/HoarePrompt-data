Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the frequency of each card number and how many operations you can perform based on that frequency. Specifically, for each unique card number, you should calculate how many groups of `k` cards you can form and then determine the remainder when the count of that card is divided by `k`. The sum of these remainders will give you the minimum number of cards you can have left.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        card_counts = Counter(l)
        min_cards = 0
        for count in card_counts.values():
            min_cards += count % k
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

This program uses the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of each card number, then calculates the remainder of each count when divided by `k` and sums these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.
