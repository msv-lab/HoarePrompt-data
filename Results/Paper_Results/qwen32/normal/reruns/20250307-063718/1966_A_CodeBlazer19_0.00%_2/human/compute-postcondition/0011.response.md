The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. This means the previous value of `l` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 2; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The values of `n` and `k` remain as integers read from the input. The value of `i` remains 2. The list `l` is now a new list of integers read from a new line of input.
