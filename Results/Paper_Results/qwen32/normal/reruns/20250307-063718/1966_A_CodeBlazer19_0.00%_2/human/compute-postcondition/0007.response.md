The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. The initial state of `l` is not relevant because it is being reassigned. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
