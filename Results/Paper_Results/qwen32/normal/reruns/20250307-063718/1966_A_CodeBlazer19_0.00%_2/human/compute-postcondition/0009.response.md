The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 2; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
