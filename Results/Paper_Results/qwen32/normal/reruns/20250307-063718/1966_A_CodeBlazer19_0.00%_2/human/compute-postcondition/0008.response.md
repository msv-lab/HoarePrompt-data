To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, we need to focus on the value of `k` as described in the initial state. The initial state specifies that `k` is an integer read from the input, but it does not provide an explicit value for `k`.

Given that `k` is an integer read from the input, the output of `k - 1` will be one less than the value of `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be `k - 1`, where `k` is the integer read from the input.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
