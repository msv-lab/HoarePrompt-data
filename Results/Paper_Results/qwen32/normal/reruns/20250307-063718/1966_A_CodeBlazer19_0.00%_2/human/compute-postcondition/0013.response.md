Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; n and k are the integers read from the input; i is t-1; l is a list of integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute.
- `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration of the loop.
- `i` is equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- `l` is the list of integers read from the input in the last iteration of the loop.
