Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the actual values of `n` and the list of card numbers. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations depends on the frequency of each card number in the list and the value of `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the occurrences of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, determine how many cards remain after performing the allowed operations. Specifically, if a card number appears `m` times, we can reduce the number of cards to `m % (k - 1)` because each operation reduces the count by `k - 1`.
3. Sum up the remaining cards for all unique card numbers to get the final answer for each test case.

The current program does not perform these steps and instead provides a constant output that is unrelated to the input values.

Correctness: **False**
