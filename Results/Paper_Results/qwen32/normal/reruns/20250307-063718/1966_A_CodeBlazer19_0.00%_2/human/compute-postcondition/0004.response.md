To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to identify the value of `k` based on the provided initial state. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The value of `k` is crucial for determining the output.
- `i` is not yet initialized and is not used in the print statement.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input, but it is also not used in the print statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

Since `k` is an integer read from the input, the output will be `k - 1`. However, without the specific value of `k`, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
