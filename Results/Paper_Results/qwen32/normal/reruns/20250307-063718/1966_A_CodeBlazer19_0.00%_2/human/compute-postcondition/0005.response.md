The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not yet initialized, which means it is the start of the first iteration, so `i` would be 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `t` should remain the same as it is the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
