The provided code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided at runtime. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `i`, and `l` are still valid, but `n` and `k` are reassigned to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 2; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
