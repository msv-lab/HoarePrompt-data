Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program simply outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the actual values of `n` and the list of card numbers. This is clearly incorrect because the minimum number of cards left should depend on the distribution of the card numbers and the value of `k`.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for this specific test case, it does so by coincidence and not because it correctly implements the logic. Let's consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
1 10
7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
9
```

In this case, the program outputs `9` instead of `1`, which is incorrect. The program should output `1` because no operations can be performed (since we need at least `k=10` cards to perform an operation and we only have `1` card).

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem requirements correctly for all possible inputs.
