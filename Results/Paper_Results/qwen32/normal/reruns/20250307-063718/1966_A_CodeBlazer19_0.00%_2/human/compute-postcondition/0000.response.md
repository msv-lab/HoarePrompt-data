The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. After the execution of the code, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer the user inputs, which is still constrained to be within the range 1 to 500. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100; c is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 100 for each c_i in c.**
