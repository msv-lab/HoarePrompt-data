Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The core of the problem is to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations any number of times. The operations involve exchanging k cards with the same number for k-1 cards of any number.

However, the program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers `c`. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left is not always `k - 1`. The correct approach involves analyzing the frequency of each card number and determining how many cards can be reduced through the allowed operations.

For example, in the first test case:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The correct answer is 2, not 2 (which is `k - 1`). The sequence of operations can reduce the number of cards to 2, but the program would output 2 without any consideration of the card values or frequencies.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
