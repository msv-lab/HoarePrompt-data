The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, which means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided during execution. The variables `t`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
