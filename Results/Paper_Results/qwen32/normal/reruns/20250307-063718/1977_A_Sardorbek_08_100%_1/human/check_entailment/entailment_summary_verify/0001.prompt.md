You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly decides if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, given the rules provided.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with 0 cubes.
   - In each move, we can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more than `n` cubes.
   - If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
     - We can add `m` cubes and then remove `(n - m)` cubes.
     - Since we can only add or remove one cube at a time, we need an even number of moves to balance out the difference (i.e., to cancel out the removals with additions).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
   - The program then checks:
     - If `b == c`, it prints "YES" (which is correct because we can add `c` cubes in `c` moves).
     - If `b < c`, it prints "NO" (which is correct because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" (which is correct because the difference `(b - c)` is even, and we can achieve `c` cubes).
     - Otherwise, it prints "No" (which is correct because the difference `(b - c)` is odd, and we can't achieve `c` cubes).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
