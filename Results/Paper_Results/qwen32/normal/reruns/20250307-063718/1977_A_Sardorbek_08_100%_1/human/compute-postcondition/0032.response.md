The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`), but none of these variables are used in the print statement. The print statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
