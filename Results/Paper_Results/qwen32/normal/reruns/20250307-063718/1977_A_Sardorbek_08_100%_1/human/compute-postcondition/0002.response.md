The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `m` are integers within certain ranges, and `a` is greater than 0. These variables are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the new values for `b` and `c` and retain the conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are integers as input**.
