Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. `i` is `i + 2`.**

In simpler terms: **After the if-else block, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` remain integers between 1 and 100, `a` remains greater than 0, `b` and `c` retain their input values, `q` remains the tuple `(b, c)`, and `i` is increased by 2. The relationship between `b` and `c` (whether they are equal, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c` with the same parity) is preserved.**
