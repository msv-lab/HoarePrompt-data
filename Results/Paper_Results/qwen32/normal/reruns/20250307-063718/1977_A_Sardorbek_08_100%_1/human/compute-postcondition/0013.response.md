The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string within the `print` function.

Since the `print` statement is `print('No')`, the output will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
