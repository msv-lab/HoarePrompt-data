Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube. The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to reach `m` cubes using `n` moves, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to bridge an even difference between `n` and `m`.

The program's logic is as follows:
- If `n` equals `m`, it prints "YES" because no moves are needed, and the current state already satisfies the condition.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to end up with more cubes than moves (since each move can add at most one cube).
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it checks if `n % 2` equals `m % 2`. If true, it prints "YES" because the difference between `n` and `m` is even, allowing a sequence of moves to reach `m` cubes. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements this logic, and the provided annotated state matches the expected behavior. The only discrepancy in the annotated state is the case sensitivity of the output strings, but the problem description states that outputs can be in any case, so this does not affect correctness.

Correctness: **True**
