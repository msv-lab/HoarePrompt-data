The provided code snippet has a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
