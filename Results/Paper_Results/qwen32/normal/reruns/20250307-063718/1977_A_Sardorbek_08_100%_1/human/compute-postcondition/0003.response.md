The code snippet assigns the tuple `(b, c)` to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are integers as input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`**.
