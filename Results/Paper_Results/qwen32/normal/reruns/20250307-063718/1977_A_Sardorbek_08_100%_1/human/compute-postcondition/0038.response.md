Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. `i` is `a - 1`.**

In simpler terms: The loop has executed `a` times, and for each iteration, the values of `b` and `c` were compared and the appropriate output ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', 'No') was printed based on the conditions. The loop counter `i` has reached `a - 1`, indicating that all iterations are completed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
