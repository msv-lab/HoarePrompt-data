Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `b` and `c` are integers.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.
- If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. (This statement is redundant, as it's always true if `b == c`).
- Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. (Again, this statement is redundant, as it's always true if `b < c`).
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. (This statement is also redundant as it's always true if `b % 2 == c % 2`).
- `i` is `i + 1` (This statement is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear definition for `i`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
