Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. `i` is `i + 2`.**

In simpler terms: **After the if-else block, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` retain their initial values. If `b` is less than `c`, the condition `b < c` holds. If `b` is not less than `c`, the condition `b >= c` holds, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. The value of `i` is increased by 2.**
