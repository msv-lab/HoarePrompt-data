Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment using the annotated code to ensure everything aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- **Conditions**:
  - If `n == m`, it's trivially possible.
  - If `n < m`, it's impossible because you can't create more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n > m`, it's possible if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because you can alternate between adding and removing cubes to adjust the height of the tower.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
2. If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
3. If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Checking the Logic:
1. **Case 1**: `b == c`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.
2. **Case 2**: `b < c`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.
3. **Case 3**: `b % 2 == c % 2`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'. This covers the scenario where `n > m` and `(n - m)` is even.
4. **Case 4**: Other cases
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

### Testing with Examples:
1. **Test Case**: `n = 3, m = 3`
   - `b == c` is True, so it prints 'YES'.
2. **Test Case**: `n = 2, m = 4`
   - `b < c` is True, so it prints 'NO'.
3. **Test Case**: `n = 5, m = 3`
   - `b % 2 == c % 2` is True (both are odd), so it prints 'YES'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Test Case**: `n = 1, m = 0`
  - `b < c` is False, but `b % 2 == c % 2` is False (1 is odd and 0 is even), so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you can't remove a cube if there are none.
- **Test Case**: `n = 100, m = 0`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is True (both are even), so it prints 'YES'. This is correct because you can remove cubes in pairs until you reach 0.
- **Test Case**: `n = 100, m = 1`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is False (100 is even and 1 is odd), so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you can't end up with 1 cube after an even number of moves.

### Annotations Validation:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic applied. They confirm that the program is correctly handling each of the cases mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description and the annotations confirm the correctness of the logic.

**Final: True**
