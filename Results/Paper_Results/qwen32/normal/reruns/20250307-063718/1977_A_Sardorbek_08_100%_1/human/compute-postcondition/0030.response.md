The provided initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes the values and conditions of several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which is a direct output of the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
