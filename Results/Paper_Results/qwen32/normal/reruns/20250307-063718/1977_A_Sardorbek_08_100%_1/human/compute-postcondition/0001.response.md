In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but only `a` is relevant for the loop's execution.

Given that `a` is an input integer and the range function in Python will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `a`, the loop will execute if `a` is at least 1.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `a` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) do not affect the execution of this specific for loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0**
