The code snippet `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. This means the values of `b` and `c` will be updated based on the input provided.

Since the initial state specifies that `b` and `c` are integers as input, and the code updates these values directly from the input, we can update the values of `b` and `c` to be the integers provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`. `i` is `i + 2`.**
