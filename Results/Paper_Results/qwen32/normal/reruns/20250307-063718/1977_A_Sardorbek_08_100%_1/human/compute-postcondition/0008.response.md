Given the initial state, we have several variables and conditions defined, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables directly. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Let's break it down:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `b` and `c` are integers, with the condition that `b` is not equal to `c` and `b` is less than `c`.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
