The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `a` is greater than 0.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are integers as input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is indeed less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b % 2` equals `c % 2` if and only if `b % 2` equals `c % 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**
