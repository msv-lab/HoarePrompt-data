You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- **Conditions**:
  - If `n == m`, it's trivially possible.
  - If `n < m`, it's impossible because you can't create more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n > m`, it's possible if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because you can alternate between adding and removing cubes to adjust the height of the tower.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
2. If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
3. If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Checking the Logic:
1. **Case 1**: `b == c`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.
2. **Case 2**: `b < c`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.
3. **Case 3**: `b % 2 == c % 2`
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'. This covers the scenario where `n > m` and `(n - m)` is even.
4. **Case 4**: Other cases
   - This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

### Testing with Examples:
1. **Test Case**: `n = 3, m = 3`
   - `b == c` is True, so it prints 'YES'.
2. **Test Case**: `n = 2, m = 4`
   - `b < c` is True, so it prints 'NO'.
3. **Test Case**: `n = 5, m = 3`
   - `b % 2 == c % 2` is True (both are odd), so it prints 'YES'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Test Case**: `n = 1, m = 0`
  - `b < c` is False, but `b % 2 == c % 2` is False (1 is odd and 0 is even), so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you can't remove a cube if there are none.
- **Test Case**: `n = 100, m = 0`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is True (both are even), so it prints 'YES'. This is correct because you can remove cubes in pairs until you reach 0.
- **Test Case**: `n = 100, m = 1`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is False (100 is even and 1 is odd), so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you can't end up with 1 cube after an even number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases that make the program incorrect.

**Correctness: True**.
