The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. However, the specific logic for determining the return value based on `n` and `m` is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and return a result for each test case.
