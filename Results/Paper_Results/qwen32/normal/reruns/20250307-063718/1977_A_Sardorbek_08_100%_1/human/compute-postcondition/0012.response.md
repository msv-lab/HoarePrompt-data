Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are integers as input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`, and `b` is not equal to `c`. Additionally, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `b % 2` is not equal to `c % 2`.**
