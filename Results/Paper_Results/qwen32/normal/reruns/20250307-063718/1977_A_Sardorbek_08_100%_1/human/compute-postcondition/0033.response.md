The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`), but these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` are defined with certain conditions but are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `i` is mentioned to be updated as `i + 2`, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
