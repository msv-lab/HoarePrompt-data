The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but these do not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
3. The variable `a` is greater than 0.
4. The variables `b` and `c` are integers, with `b` not equal to `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. Additionally, `b % 2` equals `c % 2`.
5. The variable `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

Despite these conditions and variable definitions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
