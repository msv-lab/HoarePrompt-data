Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The logic used in the code is as follows:

1. If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (number of cubes), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.

2. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because:
   - If both `b` and `c` are even, Nikita can make an even number of moves that result in an even number of cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs until the desired number is reached.
   - If both `b` and `c` are odd, Nikita can make an odd number of moves that result in an odd number of cubes by starting with one addition or removal and then pairing the rest of the moves.

4. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves since the parity of the number of cubes will always match the parity of the number of moves.

Given the above reasoning, the logic in the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
