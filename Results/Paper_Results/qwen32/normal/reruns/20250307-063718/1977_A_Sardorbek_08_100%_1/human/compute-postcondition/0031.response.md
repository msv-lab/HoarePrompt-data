The given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their conditions, but the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is hardcoded to print `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
