To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

The problem states that in each move, Nikita can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower. The goal is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here are the key points to consider:
- If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), it is possible to achieve the goal by adding one cube per move. Hence, the program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.
- If `b` is less than `c`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves since each move can only add one cube. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
- If `b` is greater than `c`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is checked. This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which means that the excess moves can be used to balance out by adding and removing cubes an equal number of times. If this condition is true, the program correctly prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:
1. For `n=3` and `m=3`, the program prints 'YES' because `b == c`.
2. For `n=2` and `m=4`, the program prints 'NO' because `b < c`.
3. For `n=5` and `m=3`, the program prints 'YES' because `b > c` and `b % 2 == c % 2` (both are odd).

The program seems to handle all the cases correctly as per the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
