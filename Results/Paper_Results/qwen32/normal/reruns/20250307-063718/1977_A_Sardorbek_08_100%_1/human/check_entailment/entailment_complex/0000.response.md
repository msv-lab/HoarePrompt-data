### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The solution logic in the provided program is as follows:

1. **If `b` (the number of moves) equals `c` (the desired number of cubes):** The program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.

2. **If `b` is less than `c`:** The program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it is impossible to reach the desired height since each move can add at most one cube.

3. **If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd):** The program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes and they have the same parity, Nikita can add cubes until he reaches `c` and then use the remaining moves to add and remove cubes in pairs, maintaining the same number of cubes.

4. **Otherwise:** The program prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` is greater than or equal to `c` but `b` and `c` have different parity, it is impossible to reach `c` because adding or removing cubes in pairs will always preserve the parity.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions and their corresponding outputs match the requirements of the problem statement.
