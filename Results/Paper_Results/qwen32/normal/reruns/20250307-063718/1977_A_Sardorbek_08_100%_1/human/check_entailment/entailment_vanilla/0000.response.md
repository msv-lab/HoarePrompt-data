To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly decides if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, given the rules provided.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with 0 cubes.
   - In each move, we can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more than `n` cubes.
   - If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
     - We can add `m` cubes and then remove `(n - m)` cubes.
     - Since we can only add or remove one cube at a time, we need an even number of moves to balance out the difference (i.e., to cancel out the removals with additions).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
   - The program then checks:
     - If `b == c`, it prints "YES" (which is correct because we can add `c` cubes in `c` moves).
     - If `b < c`, it prints "NO" (which is correct because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" (which is correct because the difference `(b - c)` is even, and we can achieve `c` cubes).
     - Otherwise, it prints "No" (which is correct because the difference `(b - c)` is odd, and we can't achieve `c` cubes).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
