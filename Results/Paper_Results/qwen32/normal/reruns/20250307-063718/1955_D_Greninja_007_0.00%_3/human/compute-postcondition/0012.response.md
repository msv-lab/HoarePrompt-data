Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `a`, `m` is an integer representing the length of list `b`, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a` with the frequency of `a[i]` decreased by 1, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` minus `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])` if `a[i]` is in `b_freq` (possibly decreased by 1), `good_subarrays` is 1 if `matches` is greater than or equal to `k` after the update, otherwise `good_subarrays` is 0, and `window_freq[a[i]]` is 0.**
