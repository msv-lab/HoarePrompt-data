Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `a`, `m` is an integer representing the length of list `b`, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`, `n` must be greater than `m`, and `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
