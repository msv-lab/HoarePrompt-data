Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `a`, `m` is an integer representing the length of list `b`, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a`.**

In simple terms: The variable `window_freq` has been updated to count the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
