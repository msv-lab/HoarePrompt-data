The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with `d` as its argument. The values of `u2vs` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `0` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
