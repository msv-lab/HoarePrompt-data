Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)` and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `2 * (len(path_ba) // 2 - 1)` elements in the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, where `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.**
