The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
