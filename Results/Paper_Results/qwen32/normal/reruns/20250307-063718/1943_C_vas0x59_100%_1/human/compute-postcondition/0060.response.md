The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple containing `c1` and `i` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll assume `i` is a predefined variable that holds some integer value. 

Since `ops` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `ops` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(c1, i)`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`, the length of `path_ba` is at least 3, `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ops` is a list containing one element `(c1, i)`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`**.
