Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input to construct an adjacency list representation of a tree, performs breadth-first searches to find the longest path in the tree, and then generates a specific set of operations based on the middle point(s) of this path. It prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, each operation consisting of a vertex and an index. The function returns `None`.**
