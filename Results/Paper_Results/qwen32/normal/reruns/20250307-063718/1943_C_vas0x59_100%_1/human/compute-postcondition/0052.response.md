The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now contain one additional element, which is the tuple `(c, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` with an odd length, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(c, i)`, `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)`, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ops` now has an additional element `(c, i)` appended to it. All other variables retain their original values.
