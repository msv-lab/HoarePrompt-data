Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`. `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`, and now also includes the newly appended element `n`. If `n` was originally `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, the variable `path_ba` now has an additional element `n` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
