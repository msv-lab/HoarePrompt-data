Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`. If `n` is `previous[b]` and equals -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`. `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`, and now also includes the newly appended element `n`. If `n` was originally `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`. `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and now also includes the newly appended element `n`. `n` is the value of `previous[n]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
