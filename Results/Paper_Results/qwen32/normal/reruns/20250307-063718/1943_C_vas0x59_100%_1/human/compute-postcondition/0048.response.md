The code snippet provided is `ops.append((c, i))`. This line of code appends a tuple containing the values of `c` and `i` to the list `ops`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we will denote the new state of `ops` as containing the tuple `(c, i)`.

The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` with an odd length, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`, `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)`, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`**.
