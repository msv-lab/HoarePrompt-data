The code snippet provided appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Based on the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains a single element `b`. After the execution of `path_ba.append(n)`, `path_ba` will now contain two elements: `b` and `n`.

The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain the same.

The output state can be described as follows:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`. If `n` is `previous[b]` and equals -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
