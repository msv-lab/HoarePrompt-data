The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2. After the operation `u -= 1`, `u` will be the first integer from the input minus 3. The values of `u2vs`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` contains the value `u` three times; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 3; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.**
