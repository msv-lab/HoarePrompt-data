The code appends the value `v` to the list at index `u` in the `u2vs` list. Given the initial state, the list at index `u` already contains the value `v`. After the operation, the list at index `u` will contain the value `v` twice. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v` twice, and the list at index `v` contains the value `u` three times; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 3; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 3.**
