`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of lists representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1) in the tree.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1) in the tree; `n` is an input integer.**
