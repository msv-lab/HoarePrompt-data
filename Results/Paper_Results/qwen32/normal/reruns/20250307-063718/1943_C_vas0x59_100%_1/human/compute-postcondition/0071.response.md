Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`u2vs`**: A list of `n` lists. The exact contents of this list are not specified.
2. **`d`**: The result of `bfs(a)`. Here, `bfs` likely stands for Breadth-First Search, and `a` is some starting node or element.
3. **`previous`**: The second result of `bfs(a)`. This typically contains information about the path taken during the BFS, such as the previous node for each node in the search.
4. **`a`**: The result of `func_1(d)`. The exact nature of `func_1` is not given, but it presumably processes `d` in some way to produce `a`.
5. **`b`**: Also the result of `func_1(d)`. This implies that `b` is the same as `a` unless `func_1` behaves differently for different calls or has side effects (which is unlikely given the context).
6. **`path_ba`**: A list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`. This path is derived from the BFS results.
7. **`ops`**: 
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)` and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `2 * (len(path_ba) // 2 - 1)` elements in the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, where `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```
This code snippet applies a lambda function to each element in the `ops` list. The lambda function takes a tuple `x` and formats it as a string where the first element of the tuple is incremented by 1, and the second element remains unchanged. The results are then printed, each on a new line.

### Determining the Output:
The exact values of `ops` depend on the path `path_ba` derived from the BFS and the conditions on its length (odd or even). However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `path_ba` and the length of `path_ba`.

- **If `path_ba` is odd**: 
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)`.
  - The printed output will be lines of the form `c+1 0`, `c+1 1`, ..., `c+1 ci`.

- **If `path_ba` is even**:
  - `ops` will contain pairs of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, where `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]` and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
  - The printed output will be lines of the form `c1+1 i`, `c2+1 i` for each odd `i`.

### Final Output:
Given the above breakdown, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **Lines of the form `c+1 i` where `c` is an element from `path_ba` and `i` is an index, formatted according to whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even**.
