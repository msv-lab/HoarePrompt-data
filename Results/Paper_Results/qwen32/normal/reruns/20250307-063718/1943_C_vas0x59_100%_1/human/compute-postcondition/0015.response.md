Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` contains the value `u` three times; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them into `u` and `v`, and converts them to integers. The initial state of `u2vs`, `n`, and the conditions on `u` and `v` remain unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are updated based on the input.
