Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`. `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`. The length of `path_ba` is odd. `ops` is an empty list.**
