Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

In simple terms, the variable `b` has been assigned the same value as `a`, which is the result of the function `func_1(d)`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged.
