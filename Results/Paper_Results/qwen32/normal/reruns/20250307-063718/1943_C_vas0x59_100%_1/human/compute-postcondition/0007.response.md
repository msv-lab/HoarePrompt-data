The code appends the value `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`. After the code execution, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` will have `u` appended to it.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains the value `u`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
