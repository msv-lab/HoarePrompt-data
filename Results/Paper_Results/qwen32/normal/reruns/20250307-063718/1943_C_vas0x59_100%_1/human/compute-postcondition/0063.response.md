The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]` and `i` has been incremented by 2. Therefore, the list `ops` now contains three elements: `(c1, i)` and the two elements it originally contained.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`, the length of `path_ba` is at least 3, `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ops` is a list containing three elements `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i-2)`, and `(c2, i-2)`**.
