The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Initially, the list at index `v` contains the value `u` twice, and the list at index `u` contains the value `v`. After appending `u` to the list at index `v`, the list at index `v` will now contain the value `u` three times.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` contains the value `u` three times; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.**
