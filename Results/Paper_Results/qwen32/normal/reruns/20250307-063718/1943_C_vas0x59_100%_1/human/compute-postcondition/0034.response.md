Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[n]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
