The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c` and `i` are already defined as the middle element of `path_ba` and `i + 1`, respectively. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` with an odd length, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(c, i)`, `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)`, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
