The code snippet appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3, the new tuple that will be appended is `(c1, 3)`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second result of `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`, the length of `path_ba` is at least 3, `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ops` is a list containing five elements `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i-2)`, `(c2, i-2)`, `(c2, i)`, and the newly appended `(c1, 3)`, `i` is 3**.
