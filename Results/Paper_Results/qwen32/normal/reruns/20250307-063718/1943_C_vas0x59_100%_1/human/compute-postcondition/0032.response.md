Given the `while True` loop, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body that would terminate it. Since the loop body is omitted, we can assume that the loop will continue to execute unless a `break` condition is met within the body.

However, the task is to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. Since it's a `while True` loop, no specific condition needs to be met for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any variables to ensure the loop continues.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`; `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `previous` is the second result of the `bfs` function when called with `a` as the argument; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`. If `n` is `previous[b]` and equals -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
