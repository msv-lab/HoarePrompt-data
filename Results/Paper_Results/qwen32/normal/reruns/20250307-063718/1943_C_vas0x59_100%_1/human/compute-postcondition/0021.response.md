Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` (where `j` is `v-1` for each input pair `(u, v)`) such that there is a connection between `i+1` and `j+1`. The variable `d` is the result of the `bfs` function when called with `0` as the argument. The variable `_` holds the second return value of the `bfs` function, which is not used in this context.**

In simple terms, the list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The variable `d` is now assigned the result of the `bfs` function starting from index `0`. The second return value of the `bfs` function is stored in `_` but is not utilized further.
