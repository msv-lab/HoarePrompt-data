To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

1. **`u2vs`**: A list of `n` lists. The exact contents are not specified.
2. **`d`**: The result of `bfs(a)`. `bfs(a)` is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node `a`. The exact contents of `d` depend on the BFS algorithm and the graph structure.
3. **`previous`**: The second result of `bfs(a)`. This is typically a list or dictionary that keeps track of the predecessor of each node in the BFS tree.
4. **`a`**: The result of `func_1(d)`. The exact value of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
5. **`b`**: The result of `func_1(d)`. Since `b` is assigned the same way as `a`, it is the same as `a`.
6. **`path_ba`**: A list containing the elements `b` and all preceding nodes in the path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list, ending with `a`. Since `a` and `b` are the same, `path_ba` will contain the path from `a` to `a`, which is just `[a]`.

Given the above, `path_ba` will be `[a]` because `a` and `b` are the same node. The length of `path_ba` is 1.

7. **`ops`**: 
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is `(len(path_ba) // 2)` and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `2 * (len(path_ba) // 2 - 1)` elements in the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, where `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.

Since the length of `path_ba` is 1 (which is odd), `ops` will contain the tuples `(c, 0)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. Here, `c` is `a` (the only element in `path_ba`), so `ops` will be `[(a, 0)]`.

The length of `ops` is therefore 1.

Output: **1**
