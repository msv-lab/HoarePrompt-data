The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` to be increased is not affected by the change in `y` as it depends on the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` before the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
