Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n // 4, m // 12)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Since the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is already given to be 1 in the precondition, the `if` condition will always be true, and `cnt` will be updated accordingly. However, the postcondition should account for the possibility of the `else` part existing, even though it is not present in this case.
