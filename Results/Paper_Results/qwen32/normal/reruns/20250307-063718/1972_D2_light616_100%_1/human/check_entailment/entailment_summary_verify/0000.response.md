Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Iterates over `t` test cases and calls `func_1()` for each.

#### `func_1()` Analysis
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

The logic in `func_1()` is as follows:
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- It checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime (`math.gcd(x, y) == 1`).
- It increments the count based on the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

However, the logic seems flawed:
1. The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are restrictive and may not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
2. The increment logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs \((a, b)\) are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
- The only pair that satisfies \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) is \((2, 2)\).

However, the given program does not correctly identify this pair because its loop and condition do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and only considers pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect.
