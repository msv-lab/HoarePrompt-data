To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of `cnt` after the given code snippet runs. Here is the code snippet again for reference:

```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is at least 5 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `n` must be at least 8
- `m` must be at least 8

First, let's compute the expressions inside the `min` function:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

2. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

3. Calculate `n // ((x + y) * x)`:
   Since `n` is at least 8:
   \[
   n // 8 \geq 8 // 8 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, `n // 8` is at least 1.

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   Since `m` is at least 8:
   \[
   m // 8 \geq 8 // 8 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, `m // 8` is at least 1.

5. Determine the `min` of the two results:
   \[
   \text{min}(n // 8, m // 8) \geq \text{min}(1, 1) = 1
   \]

Thus, `cnt` will be incremented by at least 1. Given that `cnt` was initially at least 5, after the increment, `cnt` will be at least 6.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is at least 6, `n` must be at least 8, and `m` must be at least 8.**
