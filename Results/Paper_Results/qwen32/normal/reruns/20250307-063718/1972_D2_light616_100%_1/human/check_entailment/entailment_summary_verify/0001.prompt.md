You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which presumably performs some computation or evaluation based on `n` and `m`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is designed to count the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down `func_1()`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Loop over `x`**:
   - The loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\). This is a constraint that limits the range of `x` to ensure that \(x\) does not exceed the square root of `n`.

3. **Inner loop over `y`**:
   - For each `x`, `y` is initialized to 1.
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both \(a = x \cdot k\) and \(b = y \cdot k\) (where \(k\) is a positive integer) are within the bounds of `n` and `m` respectively.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, the program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the gcd is 1, it means that `x` and `y` are coprime, and the program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = x \cdot k\) and \(b = y \cdot k\) for \(k\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(b \le m\). This is done by adding `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible pairs for a given test case, the function prints the count of valid pairs.

### Issues in the Program

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions for `x` and `y` are too restrictive. The program only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively. This does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The calculation of valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. This does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

3. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program does not consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. It only considers pairs where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively, which misses many valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
