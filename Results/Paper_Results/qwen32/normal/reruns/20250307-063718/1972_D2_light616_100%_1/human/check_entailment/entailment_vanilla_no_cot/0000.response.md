Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions for a single test case. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to find all such pairs.

The main issue is that the program only considers pairs (x, y) where x and y are relatively prime (gcd(x, y) == 1) and where (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m. This is not sufficient to cover all valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and checking if b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b. The current implementation does not do this correctly and will miss many valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version iterates over all pairs (a, b) and checks the condition directly, ensuring that all valid pairs are counted. However, this approach may not be efficient enough for the given constraints (n, m up to 2 * 10^6), and further optimizations would be necessary for large inputs.
