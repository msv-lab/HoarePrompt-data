To determine the output state, we need to know the definition of the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific changes it makes to the variables or the program state. Therefore, we can only state that the function `func_1()` has been executed, and without further details about what `func_1()` does, the only change we can confirm is that `func_1()` has been called.

Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer input from the user and must be greater than 1; `func_1()` has been executed.**
