To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of the expression inside the `min` function and then add it to `cnt`.

Given:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is at least 8
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` is at least 4
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Let's break down the expression inside the `min` function:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15
   \]
2. Calculate `n // ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n // 15
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 15, the minimum value of `n // 15` is 1 (if `n` is exactly 15).

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10
   \]
4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 10
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 4, the minimum value of `m // 10` is 0 (if `m` is exactly 4).

Now, we take the minimum of the two values:
\[
\min(n // 15, m // 10) = \min(1, 0) = 0
\]

Since the minimum value is 0, `cnt` remains unchanged:
\[
cnt += 0
\]

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is at least 8, `n` must be at least 15, `m` is at least 4, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
