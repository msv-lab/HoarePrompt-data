### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is designed to count the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down `func_1()`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Loop over `x`**:
   - The loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\). This is a constraint that limits the range of `x` to ensure that `x` does not exceed the square root of `n`.

3. **Inner loop over `y`**:
   - For each `x`, `y` is initialized to 1.
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both \(a = x \cdot k\) and \(b = y \cdot k\) (where \(k\) is a positive integer) are within the bounds of `n` and `m` respectively.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, the program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the gcd is 1, it means that `x` and `y` are coprime, and the program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = x \cdot k\) and \(b = y \cdot k\) for \(k\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(b \le m\). This is done by adding `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible pairs for a given test case, the function prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Issues in the Program:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions for `x` and `y` are too restrictive. The program only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively. This does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The calculation of valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. This does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

3. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program does not consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. It only considers pairs where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively, which misses many valid pairs.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
