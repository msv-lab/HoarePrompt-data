To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we will analyze the loop's behavior step by step, considering the initial state and the conditions provided for the first three iterations.

### Initial State:
- `x` = 2
- `y` = 1
- `cnt` = 4
- `n` ≥ 4 (specific value not given, but it must be at least 4)
- `m` ≥ 4 (specific value not given, but it must be at least 4)

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as:
- `(x + y) * x ≤ n`
- `(x + y) * y ≤ m`

### Iteration Analysis:

#### Iteration 1:
- `x` = 2, `y` = 2
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8` → `n` must be at least 8
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8` → `m` must be at least 8
- `math.gcd(2, 2) = 2` (not 1), so `cnt` remains 4

#### Iteration 2:
- `x` = 2, `y` = 3
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 10` → `n` must be at least 10
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 15` → `m` must be at least 15
- `math.gcd(2, 3) = 1`, so `cnt` increases by `min(n // 10, m // 15)`. Given `n` ≥ 10 and `m` ≥ 15, this value is at least 1.
- Thus, `cnt` becomes at least 5.

#### Iteration 3:
- `x` = 2, `y` = 4
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 4) * 2 = 12` → `n` must be at least 12
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 4) * 4 = 24` → `m` must be at least 24
- `math.gcd(2, 4) = 2` (not 1), so `cnt` remains at least 5

### Subsequent Iterations:
- `x` = 2, `y` = 5
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 5) * 2 = 14` → `n` must be at least 14
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 5) * 5 = 35` → `m` must be at least 35
- `math.gcd(2, 5) = 1`, so `cnt` increases by `min(n // 14, m // 35)`. Given `n` ≥ 14 and `m` ≥ 35, this value is at least 1.
- Thus, `cnt` becomes at least 6.

- `x` = 2, `y` = 6
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 6) * 2 = 16` → `n` must be at least 16
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 6) * 6 = 48` → `m` must be at least 48
- `math.gcd(2, 6) = 2` (not 1), so `cnt` remains at least 6.

- `x` = 2, `y` = 7
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 7) * 2 = 18` → `n` must be at least 18
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 7) * 7 = 63` → `m` must be at least 63
- `math.gcd(2, 7) = 1`, so `cnt` increases by `min(n // 18, m // 63)`. Given `n` ≥ 18 and `m` ≥ 63, this value is at least 1.
- Thus, `cnt` becomes at least 7.

### Loop Termination:
The loop will terminate when either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the increasing values of `y`, and assuming `n` and `m` are sufficiently large, the loop will terminate after `y` reaches a value where either condition is violated.

### Final Output State:
Given the pattern and the conditions, the final `cnt` value will be at least 7, with `x` remaining 2 and `y` incrementing until the loop terminates.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 8, `cnt` is at least 7.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop increments `y` starting from 2, and for each value of `y`, it checks if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. If it is, it increases `cnt` by a certain amount based on the values of `n` and `m`. The loop terminates when the product conditions `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` are met. Given the initial conditions and the pattern observed, the final state will have `x` as 2, `y` as 8 (the point where the loop condition fails), and `cnt` at least 7.
