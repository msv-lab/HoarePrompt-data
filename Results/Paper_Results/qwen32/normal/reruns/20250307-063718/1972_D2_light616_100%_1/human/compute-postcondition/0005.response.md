The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t` which is the number of iterations left. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was a specific positive integer greater than 1, and `func_1()` was executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 since each iteration reduces `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is a specific positive integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `func_1()` has been executed.**
