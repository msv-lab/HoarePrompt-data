To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine its impact on the variables directly. Assuming `func_1()` does not change `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state, the output state would remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer input from the user and must be greater than 0**.
