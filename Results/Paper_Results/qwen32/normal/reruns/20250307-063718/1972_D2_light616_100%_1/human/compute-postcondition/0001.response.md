For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the variables in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is the number of iterations the loop will run. 

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its state does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is already described as "the specific positive integer input from the user," we need to ensure that this input results in a value that allows the loop to execute. Since `t` is supposed to be a positive integer, it should already be greater than 0. However, to be explicit in our state description, we will confirm that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a specific positive integer input from the user and must be greater than 0**
