To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is at least 8
- `n` is at least 15
- `m` is at least 4
- The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1

Let's check the conditions with the current values of `x` and `y`:
1. \((x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 18\)
2. \((x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 18\)

Currently, both conditions are:
- \(18 \leq n\) (which is true since `n` is at least 15)
- \(18 \leq m\) (which is false since `m` is at least 4)

Since the second condition is false, the loop will not execute again with the current values.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 18. No other variables in the loop head (`x`, `y`, `n`) need to be adjusted because:
- `x` and `y` are already set in a way that `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` are both 18.
- `n` is already at least 15, which satisfies the first condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to ensure `m` is at least 18.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` is at least 8, `n` is at least 15, `m` must be at least 18, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**
