Since the code snippet provided is simply calling `func_1()` again, and there is no change to the variables `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state due to this function call (as no specific behavior of `func_1()` is described), the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `func_1()` has been executed.**
