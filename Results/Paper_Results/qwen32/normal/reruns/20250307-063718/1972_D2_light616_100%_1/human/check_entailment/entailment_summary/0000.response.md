### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads two integers `n` and `m`, calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the conditions, and prints the result.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

Let's analyze `func_1()` in detail:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates while \(x \cdot x \le n\).
- For each `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and iterates while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- It prints the count `cnt`.

The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

However, let's consider the correctness of the approach taken in `func_1()`:
- The approach seems to be based on iterating over possible values of `x` and `y` and checking the condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- The increment of `cnt` is based on the floor division of `n` and `m` by \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\), respectively.
- This approach does not directly address the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

The provided execution summary does not indicate that `func_1()` correctly handles all pairs (a, b) and checks the required condition. The logic for counting valid pairs seems to be flawed or incomplete.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
