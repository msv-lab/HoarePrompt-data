The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters as seen in the provided function definition. However, based on the context, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function will likely perform some computation or evaluation based on these inputs.

Given the output description is not fully provided, I will assume the function returns a result for each test case. The functionality would be described based on this assumption.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). For each test case, the function performs a computation or evaluation based on `n` and `m` and returns a result.**
