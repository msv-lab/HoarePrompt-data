Given the initial state:
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 4
- `cnt` is at least 8

The print statement is:
```python
print(cnt)
```

Since `cnt` is described as being at least 8, it means `cnt` can be 8 or any value greater than 8. However, the exact value of `cnt` is not specified beyond this condition. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `cnt` is at least 8.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is at least 8)**
