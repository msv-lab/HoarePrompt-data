To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 8
- `m` is at least 8
- If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is at least 6. Otherwise, `cnt` remains at least 5.

Let's check the conditions:

1. \((x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10\)
2. \((x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15\)

For the loop to execute again:
1. \(10 \leq n\)
2. \(15 \leq m\)

Since `n` is already at least 8, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 10. Similarly, since `m` is already at least 8, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 15.

No other variables in the loop head (`x` and `y`) need to be adjusted because the current values of `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions with the adjusted values of `n` and `m`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15**
