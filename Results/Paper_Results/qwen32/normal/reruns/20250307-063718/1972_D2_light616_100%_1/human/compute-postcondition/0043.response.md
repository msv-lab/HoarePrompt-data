Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is at least 8, `n` is at least 12, `m` is at least 4, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 3) and the new value of `y` (which is 2) remains 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
