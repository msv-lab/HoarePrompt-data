To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is at least 5 if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, `n` is at least 6, and `m` is at least 3. If the gcd of `x` and `y` is not 1, `cnt` remains 4.

Let's evaluate the conditions with the current values of `x` and `y`:
1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`

Given that `n` is at least 6 and `m` is at least 3, the current values of `n` and `m` do not satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` because 8 is not less than or equal to 6 or 3.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` so that both conditions hold true with `x = 2` and `y = 2`.

Thus, we need:
- `(x + y) * x <= n` which means `8 <= n`, so `n` must be at least 8.
- `(x + y) * y <= m` which means `8 <= m`, so `m` must be at least 8.

The values of `x`, `y`, and `cnt` do not need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is at least 5 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `n` must be at least 8, and `m` must be at least 8**
