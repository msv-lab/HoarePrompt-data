Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 4, `cnt` is at least 8, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 18, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. The values of `x`, `cnt`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1.
