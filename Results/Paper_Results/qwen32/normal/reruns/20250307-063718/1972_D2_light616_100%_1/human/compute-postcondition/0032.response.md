To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of `cnt` after the given line of code is executed. The code modifies `cnt` by adding to it the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` must be at least 10
- `m` must be at least 15

First, let's calculate the two expressions inside the `min` function:

1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`

Now, the expressions inside the `min` function become:

1. `n // 10`
2. `m // 15`

Since `n` is at least 10, `n // 10` will be at least 1. Similarly, since `m` is at least 15, `m // 15` will be at least 1. 

The exact values of `n // 10` and `m // 15` depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we know they are both at least 1. The `min` function will return the smaller of these two values.

Thus, `cnt` is incremented by the smaller of `n // 10` and `m // 15`. The exact value of `cnt` after the operation depends on the initial value of `cnt`, `n`, and `m`.

Since the problem does not specify the initial value of `cnt`, we can only describe the change in terms of the expressions.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 10` and `m // 15`.**
