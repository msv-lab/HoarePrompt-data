The variable in the loop head is `x`, and the loop condition is `x * x <= n`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `x * x <= n` holds true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 8 (not relevant for the loop condition)
- `cnt` is at least 7 (not relevant for the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time, `x * x` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 3, so `x * x` is 9. Therefore, `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 8, `cnt` is at least 7, and `n` must be at least 9**
