To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand that the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the initial positive integer input from the user. Given the pattern of the output states after the first few iterations, we can infer that `func_1()` will be executed `t` times in total.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations of the loop will be that `func_1()` has been executed `t` times and `t` remains unchanged as the initial specific positive integer input from the user.

Output State: **t is a specific positive integer input from the user and func_1() has been executed t times.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, the variable `t` retains its initial value, and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times.
