The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 4. The condition `x * x <= n` translates to `2 * 2 <= n`, which means `4 <= n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4. Since the condition is already met with `n` being at least 4, no further adjustment is needed to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 4, `cnt` is 4, `n` is at least 4**
