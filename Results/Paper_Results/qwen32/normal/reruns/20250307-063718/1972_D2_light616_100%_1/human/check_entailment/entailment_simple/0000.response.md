### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). However, there are several issues with the provided code.

1. **Function Call in `__main__`:**
   The program calls `func_2()` in the `__main__` block, which is correct since `func_2()` handles multiple test cases. However, `func_1()` should be responsible for processing a single test case and calculating the number of valid pairs for given \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. The nested while loops and the conditions inside them do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Specifically, the loops and conditions do not correctly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This can be done using nested loops or more optimized methods, but the provided code does not implement this correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic in `func_1()`, the program is not correct. The provided code does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The logic in `func_1()` is flawed, and the program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases.
Correctness: **False**
