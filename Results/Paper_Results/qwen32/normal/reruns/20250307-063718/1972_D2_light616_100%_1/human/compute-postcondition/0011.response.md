To determine the new state, we start by analyzing the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

The code snippet is:
```
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Given:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the expression:
- `(x + y) * x` becomes `(1 + 2) * 1` which is `3 * 1` or `3`
- `(x + y) * y` becomes `(1 + 2) * 2` which is `3 * 2` or `6`

Now, the expression inside the `min` function becomes:
- `n // 3`
- `m // 6`

The code will add the minimum of these two values to `cnt`. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` will be its previous value plus `min(n // 3, m // 6)`.

Since we do not have a specific value for `cnt`, we will express the new value of `cnt` as `cnt + min(n // 3, m // 6)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is `cnt + min(n // 3, m // 6)`**.
