Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions for multiple test cases. Let's break down the functionality of each function and evaluate their correctness.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Input**: Two positive integers `n` and `m`.
- **Process**: 
  - The function iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
  - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
  - It checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, meaning `x` and `y` are coprime.
  - It then checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` to ensure the pairs `(a, b)` are within the given limits.
  - If the conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
- **Output**: Prints the count of valid pairs.

### Function `func_2`:
- **Input**: A positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- **Process**: 
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input values `n` and `m`.
- **Output**: None (implicitly, as `func_1` handles the output for each test case).

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be based on the mathematical condition that `b * gcd(a, b)` should be a multiple of `a + b`. The function iterates through possible pairs and checks if they satisfy the condition by ensuring `gcd(a, b) == 1` and calculating the count based on the divisibility condition.
- However, the provided state comment in `func_1` ("State: x is 5, y is 4, cnt is at least 8.") does not align with the logic of the function and the problem constraints. It seems to be an incorrect or misleading comment, as the function's logic and the problem's requirements do not necessarily imply that `cnt` must be at least 8 for `x = 5` and `y = 4`.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Despite the misleading comment in `func_1`, the logic of the functions appears to be correct based on the problem description. The functions are designed to count the valid pairs for each test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
