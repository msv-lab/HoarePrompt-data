Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 8, and `m` is at least 8. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is at least 6. Otherwise, `cnt` remains at least 5.**

The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so `y` is now 3. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
