Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is `cnt + min(n // 3, m // 6)`**

Natural language: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
