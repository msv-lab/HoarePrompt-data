To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. Let's analyze the current state:

- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is at least 8 (not used in the loop condition)
- `n` is at least 12
- `m` is at least 4
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1 (not used in the loop condition)

First, let's compute `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values of `x` and `y`:

- `(x + y) * x = (3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
- `(x + y) * y = (3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`

Now, let's check the conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `15 <= n`. Since `n` is at least 12, this condition is not satisfied.
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `10 <= m`. Since `m` is at least 4, this condition is satisfied.

Since the first condition `15 <= n` is not satisfied, the loop will not execute again with the current values. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` so that `15 <= n` is true. We can adjust `n` to be at least 15.

No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions only involve `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, and we've already determined that `x` and `y` do not need to be changed, and `m` already satisfies its condition.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is at least 8, `n` must be at least 15, `m` is at least 4, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**
