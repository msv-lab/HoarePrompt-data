Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function seems to calculate the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's first examine `func_1()` in detail:

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

The logic in `func_1()` seems to be based on iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking if they satisfy the given conditions. The key part of the logic is the loop and the condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. However, the loop and the condition do not seem to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the loop only considers pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime and does not seem to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.

Let's consider a simple example to verify the correctness of the program. For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs \((a, b)\) are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). We need to check which of these pairs satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

- For \((1, 1)\), \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\) and \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not a multiple of 2.
- For \((1, 2)\), \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\) and \(1 + 2 = 3\), which is not a multiple of 3.
- For \((1, 3)\), \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\) and \(1 + 3 = 4\), which is not a multiple of 4.
- For \((2, 1)\), \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\) and \(2 + 1 = 3\), which is not a multiple of 3.
- For \((2, 2)\), \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\) and \(2 + 2 = 4\), which is a multiple of 4.
- For \((2, 3)\), \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is not a multiple of 5.

The only valid pair is \((2, 2)\), so the output should be 1. However, the given program does not seem to correctly handle this case, as it only considers pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime and does not seem to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly handle all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and only considers pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
