### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements:

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each.

##### Function `func_1()`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop over `x`**:
   - Runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\). This limits the range of `x` to the square root of `n`.

3. **Inner Loop over `y`**:
   - For each `x`, `y` is initialized to 1.
   - Runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If true, it adds `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints the count of valid pairs for the current test case.

##### Issues in the Program:

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions for `x` and `y` are too restrictive. The program only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively. This does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The calculation of valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. This does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

3. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program does not consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. It only considers pairs where `a` and `b` are multiples of `x` and `y` respectively, which misses many valid pairs.

##### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) is satisfied. The provided program does not do this.

#### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **False**
