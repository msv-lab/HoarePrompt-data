You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mn` is 100, `i` is equal to `q`. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct. The program correctly identifies when the sequence forms a stair or a peak.
   - However, there is an issue with the `else` statement. The `else` statement is currently associated with the second `if` statement (`if a < b > c:`). This means that if the first condition (`if a < b < c:`) is true, the program will print "STAIR" and then proceed to check the second condition. If the second condition is false, it will print "NONE", which is incorrect because we've already determined it's a stair.

4. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The `else` statement should be associated with the entire block of conditions. This can be achieved by using `elif` (else if) for the second condition. This way, if the first condition is true, it will print "STAIR" and skip the rest. If the first condition is false, it will check the second condition. If the second condition is true, it will print "PEAK". If neither condition is true, it will print "NONE".

5. **Correct Code**:
   - Here's how the corrected code should look:
     ```python
     def func():
         q = int(input())
         for i in range(q):
             (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
             if a < b < c:
                 print('STAIR')
             elif a < b > c:
                 print('PEAK')
             else:
                 print('NONE')
     ```

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program is incorrect due to the improper use of the `else` statement. The `else` is currently associated with only the second condition, which causes it to print "NONE" in cases where the first condition is true.

Correctness: **False**
