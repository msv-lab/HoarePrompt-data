The `print('PEAK')` statement will output the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `mn` as described in the initial state. The string 'PEAK' is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any of the other variables.

Output: **PEAK**
