Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 0, `mn` is 100. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b > c`, meaning `b` is not greater than both `a` and `c` simultaneously.**
