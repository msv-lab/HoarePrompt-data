The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, and `i`) and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will not be influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('PEAK')` statement is straightforward and will output the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of the other variables.
2. The conditions provided in the initial state (e.g., `1 <= t <= 1000`, `a < b < c`, `q > 0`, `mn = 100`, `i = 4`) do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
