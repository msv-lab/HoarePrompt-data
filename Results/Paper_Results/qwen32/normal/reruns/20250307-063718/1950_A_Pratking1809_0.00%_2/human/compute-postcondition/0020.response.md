The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This affects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but does not change the values of `t`, `q`, `mn`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 5, `mn` is 100, `i` is 5.**

Natural language description: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged.
