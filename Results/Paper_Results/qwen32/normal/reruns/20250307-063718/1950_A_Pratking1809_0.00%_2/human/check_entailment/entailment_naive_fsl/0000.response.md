Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the handling of the "NONE" condition. Specifically, the `else` block is incorrectly placed, which means "NONE" will be printed whenever the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not met, even if the first condition (`a < b < c`) is true. This results in "NONE" being printed instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if a < b < c:
    print('STAIR')
if a < b > c:
    print('PEAK')
else:
    print('NONE')
```

In this code, if `a < b < c` is true, "STAIR" is printed. However, the `else` block is associated with the second `if` statement, not the first one. As a result, if `a < b < c` is true, the second `if` statement (`a < b > c`) is still evaluated, and if it is false, the `else` block is executed, printing "NONE" instead of "STAIR".

To fix this, the `else` block should be associated with the first `if` statement. Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the `elif` statement ensures that "PEAK" is only printed if `a < b > c` is true and `a < b < c` is false. If neither condition is true, "NONE" is printed. This ensures the program correctly identifies stairs, peaks, and neither.
