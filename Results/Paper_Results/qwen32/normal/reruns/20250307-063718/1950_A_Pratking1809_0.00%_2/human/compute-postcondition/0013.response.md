The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial state of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not specified, so they will now hold the values provided by the input. The values of `t`, `q`, `mn`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 0, `mn` is 100, `i` is 4**.
