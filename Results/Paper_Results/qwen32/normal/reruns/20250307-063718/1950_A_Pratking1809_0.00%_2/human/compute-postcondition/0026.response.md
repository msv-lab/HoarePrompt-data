Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mn` is 100, `i` is equal to `q`. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `q`, indicating that the loop has completed the number of iterations specified by `q`. The values of `t`, `mn`, and the ranges for `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
