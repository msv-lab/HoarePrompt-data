Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each of the test cases. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it checks if the digits form a "STAIR" using the condition `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true. It then checks if the digits form a "PEAK" using the condition `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if true. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but is not used in the program, which does not affect the correctness of the solution. The program correctly handles the input constraints and outputs the expected results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
