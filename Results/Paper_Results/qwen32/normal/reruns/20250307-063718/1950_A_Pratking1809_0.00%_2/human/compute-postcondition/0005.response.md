The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is `print('STAIR')`. This statement is a simple print command that outputs the string 'STAIR' to the console.

The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and will output the string 'STAIR' as it is.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'STAIR'.

Output: **STAIR**
