Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the program:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `q` which indicates the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the condition `a < b < c` is true. If it is, the program prints "STAIR".
4. If the first condition is not met, it checks if the condition `a < b > c` is true. If it is, the program prints "PEAK".
5. If neither of the conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The execution summary matches the intended behavior of the program. The program correctly handles the input format and outputs the expected results based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
