The code snippet provided initializes a variable `mn` with the value 100. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100.**
