The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `q` must still be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 5, `mn` is 100, `i` is 5**
