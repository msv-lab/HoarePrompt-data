Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 0, `mn` is 100, `i` is 4. If `a < b < c`, the same conditions hold as in the precondition. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In simpler terms, after the if-else block executes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged unless `a < b < c`, in which case the conditions stated in the precondition still hold.
