You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the handling of the "NONE" condition. Specifically, the `else` block is incorrectly placed, which means "NONE" will be printed whenever the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not met, even if the first condition (`a < b < c`) is true. This results in "NONE" being printed instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if a < b < c:
    print('STAIR')
if a < b > c:
    print('PEAK')
else:
    print('NONE')
```

In this code, if `a < b < c` is true, "STAIR" is printed. However, the `else` block is associated with the second `if` statement, not the first one. As a result, if `a < b < c` is true, the second `if` statement (`a < b > c`) is still evaluated, and if it is false, the `else` block is executed, printing "NONE" instead of "STAIR".

To fix this, the `else` block should be associated with the first `if` statement. Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the `elif` statement ensures that "PEAK" is only printed if `a < b > c` is true and `a < b < c` is false. If neither condition is true, "NONE" is printed. This ensures the program correctly identifies stairs, peaks, and neither.
