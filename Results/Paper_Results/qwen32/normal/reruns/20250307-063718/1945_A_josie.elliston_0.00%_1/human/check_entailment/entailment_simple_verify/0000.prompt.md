You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly account for the allocation of universals when there are leftover extroverts after forming groups of three.

Let's analyze the given code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly divided into groups of three. If not, it checks if the leftover extroverts plus the universals can form a group of three.
   - If the leftover extroverts plus the universals cannot form a group of three, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by summing them and dividing by three (using `ceil` to round up).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1`. It does not correctly handle cases where the leftover extroverts can be paired with universals to form groups of two or one extrovert and two universals. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1 2 2
```
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 2 universals.
- The extroverts cannot form a group of three, so we need to check if the leftover extroverts can be paired with universals.
- One extrovert can be paired with two universals, and the other extrovert can be paired with one universal.
- This requires a total of 2 tents (one for the introvert and one for the extroverts and universals).

However, the program will return `-1` because the leftover extroverts (2) plus the universals (2) cannot form a group of three.

**Corrected Code Logic:**
- First, allocate tents for introverts (one tent per introvert).
- Then, allocate tents for extroverts in groups of three.
- If there are leftover extroverts (1 or 2), use universals to form valid groups.
- If it's not possible to form valid groups with the universals, return `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a, b, c):
    # Tents for introverts
    tents = a
    
    # Tents for extroverts in groups of three
    tents += b // 3
    b %= 3
    
    # Handle leftover extroverts
    if b == 1:
        if c >= 2:
            tents += 1
            c -= 2
        else:
            return -1
    elif b == 2:
        if c >= 1:
            tents += 1
            c -= 1
        else:
            return -1
    
    # Allocate remaining universals in groups of three
    tents += ceil(c / 3)
    
    return tents

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    return min_tents(introverts, extroverts, universals)
```

This corrected code handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of tents is calculated correctly.
