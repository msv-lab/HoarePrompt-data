### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to verify if the program correctly meets the problem's requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - Each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be accommodated in any configuration.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of tents required to satisfy all participants' preferences or determine if it's impossible.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remainder of extroverts and the number of universals can fill the remaining spots in a tent.
     - If the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate extroverts).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed, considering the extroverts and universals together.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
     - It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
     - Extroverts need 1 tent (since 2 extroverts can share one tent with 1 universal).
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + universals) = 2
     - Output: 2 (This matches the given example output, which is 3. There seems to be a discrepancy here, but let's check other cases.)
   
   - **Test Case 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
     - Extroverts need 2 tents (since 4 extroverts need 2 tents with 2 extroverts each, but we only have 1 universal, so it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts).
     - Output: -1 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
     - Extroverts need 2 tents (since 4 extroverts need 2 tents with 2 extroverts each).
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3
     - Output: 3 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1
     - Extroverts need 1 tent (since 1 extrovert needs 1 tent with 2 others, but we only have 1 universal, so it's impossible to accommodate the extrovert).
     - Output: -1 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2
     - Extroverts need 1 tent (since 3 extroverts need 1 tent with 3 extroverts).
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + universals) = 2
     - Output: 2 (This matches the given example output, which is 3. There seems to be a discrepancy here, but let's check other cases.)
   
   - **Test Case 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
     - Extroverts need 3 tents (since 7 extroverts need 3 tents with 3 extroverts in two tents and 1 extrovert with 2 universals).
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + universals) = 22
     - Output: 22 (This matches the given example output, which is 28. There seems to be a discrepancy here, but let's check other cases.)
   
   - **Test Case 7:** `0 0 0`
     - Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
     - No tents needed.
     - Output: 0 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
     - 7 tents needed for introverts.
     - Output: 7 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0
     - Extroverts need 8 tents (since 24 extroverts need 8 tents with 3 extroverts each).
     - Output: 8 (This matches the given example output.)
   
   - **Test Case 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
     - Extroverts need 333333334 tents (since 1000000000 extroverts need 333333333 tents with 3 extroverts each and 1 tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals).
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) = 1333333334
     - Output: 1333333334 (This matches the given example output, which is 1666666667. There seems to be a discrepancy here, but let's check other cases.)

Given the discrepancies in the test cases, it seems that the function `func_1` might not be correctly handling the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the number of universals is insufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents.

### Conclusion:
The program does not appear to be correct based on the discrepancies observed in the test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
