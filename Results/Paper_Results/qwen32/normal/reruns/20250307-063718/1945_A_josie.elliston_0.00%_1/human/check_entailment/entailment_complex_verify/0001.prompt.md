You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :

It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3.

    #The program returns -1 if ret is None else the sum of introverts and ret, where introverts is a non-negative integer and ret is the result of func_1(extroverts, universals)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It computes a result using `func_1` with the extroverts and universals. If the result is `None`, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the sum of the introverts and the result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a separate tent.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any type of tent.

### Key Points:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- The number of tents required for introverts is straightforward: `a` tents.
- For extroverts, since each extrovert needs a tent with two others, the number of tents required for extroverts is `ceil(b / 3)`. However, if there are leftover extroverts (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`), we need to accommodate them with universals.
- If the leftover extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and we should return `-1`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero, it checks if the leftover extroverts plus the number of universals can form a valid tent. If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts plus universals divided by 3.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating it's impossible to satisfy the conditions).
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Testing the Code:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `2`, Universals: `3`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

2. **Example 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `4`, Universals: `1`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2` (but 4 % 3 = 1 and 1 + 1 < 3, so it's impossible)
   - Total tents: `-1`

3. **Example 3**: `1 4 2`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `4`, Universals: `2`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 1`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `1`, Universals: `1`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = 1` (but 1 % 3 = 1 and 1 + 1 < 3, so it's impossible)
   - Total tents: `-1`

5. **Example 5**: `1 3 2`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `3`, Universals: `2`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

The code correctly handles these examples, indicating it is likely correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints and handles the edge cases appropriately.
