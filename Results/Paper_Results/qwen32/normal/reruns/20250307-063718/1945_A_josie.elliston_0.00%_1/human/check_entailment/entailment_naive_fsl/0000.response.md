Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly account for the allocation of universals when there are leftover extroverts after forming groups of three.

Let's analyze the given code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly divided into groups of three. If not, it checks if the leftover extroverts plus the universals can form a group of three.
   - If the leftover extroverts plus the universals cannot form a group of three, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by summing them and dividing by three (using `ceil` to round up).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1`. It does not correctly handle cases where the leftover extroverts can be paired with universals to form groups of two or one extrovert and two universals. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1 2 2
```
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 2 universals.
- The extroverts cannot form a group of three, so we need to check if the leftover extroverts can be paired with universals.
- One extrovert can be paired with two universals, and the other extrovert can be paired with one universal.
- This requires a total of 2 tents (one for the introvert and one for the extroverts and universals).

However, the program will return `-1` because the leftover extroverts (2) plus the universals (2) cannot form a group of three.

**Corrected Code Logic:**
- First, allocate tents for introverts (one tent per introvert).
- Then, allocate tents for extroverts in groups of three.
- If there are leftover extroverts (1 or 2), use universals to form valid groups.
- If it's not possible to form valid groups with the universals, return `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a, b, c):
    # Tents for introverts
    tents = a
    
    # Tents for extroverts in groups of three
    tents += b // 3
    b %= 3
    
    # Handle leftover extroverts
    if b == 1:
        if c >= 2:
            tents += 1
            c -= 2
        else:
            return -1
    elif b == 2:
        if c >= 1:
            tents += 1
            c -= 1
        else:
            return -1
    
    # Allocate remaining universals in groups of three
    tents += ceil(c / 3)
    
    return tents

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    return min_tents(introverts, extroverts, universals)
```

This corrected code handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of tents is calculated correctly.
