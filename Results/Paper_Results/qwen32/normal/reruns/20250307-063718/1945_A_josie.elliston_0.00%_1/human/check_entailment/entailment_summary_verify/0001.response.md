### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and its correctness based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a separate tent.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any type of tent.

#### Key Points:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- The number of tents required for introverts is straightforward: `a` tents.
- For extroverts, since each extrovert needs a tent with two others, the number of tents required for extroverts is `ceil(b / 3)`. However, if there are leftover extroverts (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`), we need to accommodate them with universals.
- If the leftover extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and we should return `-1`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero, it checks if the leftover extroverts plus the number of universals can form a valid tent. If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts plus universals divided by 3.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating it's impossible to satisfy the conditions).
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

#### Detailed Examination of the Code:
Let's carefully go through the logic and see if it matches the problem requirements.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If true, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to form a valid tent with the leftover extroverts and universals).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals as `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) and the result from `func_1`.

#### Testing the Code:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `2`, Universals: `3`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

2. **Example 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `4`, Universals: `1`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2` (but `4 % 3 = 1` and `1 + 1 < 3`, so it's impossible)
   - Total tents: `-1`

3. **Example 3**: `1 4 2`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `4`, Universals: `2`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 1`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `1`, Universals: `1`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = 1` (but `1 % 3 = 1` and `1 + 1 < 3`, so it's impossible)
   - Total tents: `-1`

5. **Example 5**: `1 3 2`
   - Introverts: `1`, Extroverts: `3`, Universals: `2`
   - Tents for introverts: `1`
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

The code correctly handles these examples, indicating it is likely correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints and handles the edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
