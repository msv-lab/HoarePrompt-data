The function `f` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. It should accept three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, all of which are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9). The correct function definition should be `def f(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:`.
