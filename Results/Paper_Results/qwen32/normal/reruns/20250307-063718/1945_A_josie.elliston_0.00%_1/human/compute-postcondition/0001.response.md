Output State: **The program returns -1 if ret is None else the sum of introverts and ret, where introverts is a non-negative integer and ret is the result of func_1(extroverts, universals)**

In simpler terms, if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`, the program returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
