To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze each part of the program and see if it meets the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description.

1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of tents needed while respecting everyone's preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to check if we can use universals to fill up the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If the number of extroverts modulo 3 plus the number of universals is less than 3, it means we can't form a valid tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, so we return `None`.
   - Otherwise, we return the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate everyone in groups of up to 3.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
   - It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so we return -1.
   - Otherwise, we add the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

4. **Testing the program:**
   - Let's consider the first test case: `1 2 3`.
     - `func_1(2, 3)` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - `2 % 3 != 0`, but `2 % 3 + 3 = 5 >= 3`, so we return `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`.
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
     - This matches the expected output.
   - Let's consider the second test case: `1 4 1`.
     - `func_1(4, 1)` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - `4 % 3 != 0`, and `4 % 3 + 1 = 2 < 3`, so we return `None`.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.
     - This matches the expected output.
   - We can verify the other test cases similarly.

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
