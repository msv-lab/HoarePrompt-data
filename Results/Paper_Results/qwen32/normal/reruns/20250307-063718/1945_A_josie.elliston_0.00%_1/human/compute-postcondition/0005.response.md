Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3. Given the conditions, this value is at least 2.**

Explanation: Since `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 is either 1 or 2. Adding this remainder to `universals` results in a sum that is 3 or greater. Therefore, the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` is at least 3, and dividing by 3 and taking the ceiling results in at least 2.
