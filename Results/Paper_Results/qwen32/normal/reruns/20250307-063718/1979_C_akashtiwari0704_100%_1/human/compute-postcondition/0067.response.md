The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here is the breakdown:

- The initial state provides information about several variables (`bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, etc.), but these do not influence the `print(-1)` statement.
- The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **-1**
