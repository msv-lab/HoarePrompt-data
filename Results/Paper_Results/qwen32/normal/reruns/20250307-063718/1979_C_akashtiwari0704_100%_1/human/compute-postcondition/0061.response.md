The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was already the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i-1])`. Now, it will be further incremented by `int(a[i])`.

The other variables like `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also not changed by this line of code.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain the same, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i-1])` plus `int(a[i])`, `i` is i+1**.
