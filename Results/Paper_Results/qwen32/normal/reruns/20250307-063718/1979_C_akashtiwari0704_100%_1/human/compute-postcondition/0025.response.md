Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `a` is a list of integers with `a[0]` updated to `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` updated to `prod // a[1]`, and `a[2]` updated to `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + prod // a[1] + int(a[2])`, `i` is 2`**

The value of `sumo` has been updated by adding `int(a[2])` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
