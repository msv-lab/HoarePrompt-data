The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The initial state of the variables `bets`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The new variable `a` is introduced and populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
