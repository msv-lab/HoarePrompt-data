Output State: **'a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[bets-1] '**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a string that is a concatenation of all elements in the list `a` up to the `bets`-th element, with each element followed by a space. The loop runs `bets` times, appending each element of `a` to `ans` in sequence.
