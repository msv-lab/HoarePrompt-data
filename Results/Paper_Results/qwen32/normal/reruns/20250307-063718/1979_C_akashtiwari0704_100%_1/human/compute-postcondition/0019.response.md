The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `sumo` will be updated to the value of `a[0]`.

Since `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` before this code snippet, `a[0]` is now `prod // a[0]`. Therefore, `sumo` will be set to `prod // a[0]`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[i]` updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0]`, `i` is 0**.
