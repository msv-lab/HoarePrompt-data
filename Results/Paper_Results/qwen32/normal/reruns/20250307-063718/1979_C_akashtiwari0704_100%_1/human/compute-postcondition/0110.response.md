To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state provided. The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` modifies the `ans` variable by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `bets` must be greater than 0 (this condition does not affect the given code snippet directly).
- `i` is 0.

The variable `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is a predefined list or array. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of `a`.

The code snippet will append the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space to `ans`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`ans` is `'a[0] '`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that `ans` now holds the string representation of the first element of `a` followed by a space, while `bets` and `i` retain their initial conditions.
