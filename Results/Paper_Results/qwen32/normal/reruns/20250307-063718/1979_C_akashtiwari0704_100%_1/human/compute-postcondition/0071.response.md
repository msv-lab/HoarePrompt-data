The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string. This means that the `ans` variable, which was initially an empty string, will now contain the string representation of `a[i]` with a trailing space.

The values of `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `sumo` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list, `prod` is the same, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space.**
