The given print statement is `print(-1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `-1`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- The initial state describes several variables (`bets`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `prod`, `a`, `sumo`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1` to the console.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **-1**
