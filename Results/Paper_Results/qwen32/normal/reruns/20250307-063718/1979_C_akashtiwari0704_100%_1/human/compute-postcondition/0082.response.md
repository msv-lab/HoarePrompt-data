To solve this, we need to understand the given code and how it affects the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `g` is initially 1.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is initially 0.

The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`.

Let's break down the impact:
- `g` is initially 1.
- `l[i]` is the first element of the list `l` because `i` is 0.
- `gcd(g, l[i])` will be the gcd of 1 and `l[0]`, which is always 1 because the gcd of any number with 1 is 1.

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
```python
g = 1 * l[0] // 1
g = l[0]
```

So, the value of `g` will be updated to the first element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`bets` is the same, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list, `prod` is the same, `t` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` must have at least 1 element, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `T` is `T + 1`, `i` is 0**.

In natural language: The value of `g` is updated to the first element of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
