Output State: **`bets` is the same, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list, `prod` is the same, `t` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` must have at least 1 element, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `T` is `T + 1`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `g` has been updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
