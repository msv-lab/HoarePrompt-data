The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is `'a[0] '`, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be `'a[0] a[1] '`.

Output State: **`ans` is `'a[0] a[1] '`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
