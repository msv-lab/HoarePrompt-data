Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `g` is 1.**

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and a new variable `g` is introduced and set to 1.
