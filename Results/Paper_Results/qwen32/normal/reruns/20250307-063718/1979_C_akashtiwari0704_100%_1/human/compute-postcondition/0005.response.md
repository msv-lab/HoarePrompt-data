The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` has at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `g` is `l[0]`; `l` is a list with at least one element; `i` is 1**
