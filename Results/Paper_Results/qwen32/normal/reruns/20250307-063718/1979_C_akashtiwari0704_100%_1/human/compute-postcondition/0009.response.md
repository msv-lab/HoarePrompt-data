Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`; `l` is a list with `n` elements; `i` is `n-1`**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list `l`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `l`.
