The code snippet assigns a list of integers to the variable `a`. The integers are obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. The other variables (`bets`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `prod`, `sumo`, `T`, `g`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t`, `n`, `k`, `prod`, `sumo`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain the same.**
