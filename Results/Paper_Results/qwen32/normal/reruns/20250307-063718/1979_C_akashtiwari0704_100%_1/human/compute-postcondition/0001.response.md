In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `T` and it iterates over the range of `t`. The execution of the loop depends on the value of `t`. The variables `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Since the problem states that `t` is already in the range 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for completeness, we can state their conditions as given.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.**
