Postcondition: **`bets` is the same, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list, `prod` is the same, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
