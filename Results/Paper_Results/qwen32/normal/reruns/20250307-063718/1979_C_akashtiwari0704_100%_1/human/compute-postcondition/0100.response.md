The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to the variable `sumo`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, and `i` is 1. The value of `sumo` is not specified in the initial state, so we will denote its new value after the operation.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `bets` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 1, `a[i]` remains as `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is now its previous value plus the integer value of `a[i]`.
