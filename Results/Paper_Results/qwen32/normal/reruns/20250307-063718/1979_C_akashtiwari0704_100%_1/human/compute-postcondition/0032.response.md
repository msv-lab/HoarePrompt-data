The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, it now contains the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. The other variables (`bets`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` has its first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` remains the same, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.**
