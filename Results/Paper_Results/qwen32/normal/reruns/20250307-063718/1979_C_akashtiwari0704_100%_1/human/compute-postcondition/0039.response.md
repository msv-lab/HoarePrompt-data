Postcondition: **`bets`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `prod` remain the same. `a` has its first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]`. `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is maintained. Otherwise, the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` are as specified in the else part.**
