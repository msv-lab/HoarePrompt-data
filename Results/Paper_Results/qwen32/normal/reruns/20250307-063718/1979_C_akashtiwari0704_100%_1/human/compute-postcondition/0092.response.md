The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. 

Given the initial state, `a` was previously defined as a list where each element `a[i]` was `prod // a[i]` from the initial list. After executing the given code, `a` is reassigned to the new list of integers read from the input.

The other variables remain unchanged: `bets`, `prod`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `l`, `sumo`, `ans`, and `T`.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; the function `lcm` computes and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the input list `l`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `prod` is the same; `t`, `n`, `k`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged; `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`; `T` is `T + 1`.**
