The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`, which is `prod // a[2]`. Therefore, `sumo` will be incremented by the integer value of `prod // a[2]`.

The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `a[2]`, and `prod`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(prod // a[2])`**.
