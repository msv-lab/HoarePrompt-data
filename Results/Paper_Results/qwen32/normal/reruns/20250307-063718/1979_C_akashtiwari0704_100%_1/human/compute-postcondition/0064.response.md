Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain the same, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i-1])` plus `int(a[i])` plus `int(a[i])`, `i` is the incremented value from the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms: The value of `sumo` has been updated to include an additional `int(a[i])`, so it is now the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i-1])` plus `int(a[i])` plus `int(a[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
