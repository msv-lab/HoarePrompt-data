The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list `a`. The value of `sumo` is initially `prod // a[0]`. After the operation, `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0] + a[1]`.

Since `a[1]` is already defined as `prod // a[1]` in the initial state, the final value of `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + prod // a[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[0]` updated to `prod // a[0]` and `a[1]` updated to `prod // a[1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + prod // a[1]`, `i` is 1**.
