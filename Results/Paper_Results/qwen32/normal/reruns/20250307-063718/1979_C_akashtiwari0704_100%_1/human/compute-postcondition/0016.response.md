Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `prod` is the least common multiple of the integers in the list `a`; `sumo` is 0.**

The variable `sumo` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values as provided in the initial state.
