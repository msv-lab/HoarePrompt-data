The code snippet provided sets `sumo` to 0. This affects the variable `sumo` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; the function `lcm` computes and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the input list `l`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `t`, `n`, `k`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged; `sumo` is 0; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`; `T` is `T + 1`.**
