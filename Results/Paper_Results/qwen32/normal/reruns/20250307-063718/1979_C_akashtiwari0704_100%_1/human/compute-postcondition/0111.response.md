The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`ans` is `'a[0] '`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
