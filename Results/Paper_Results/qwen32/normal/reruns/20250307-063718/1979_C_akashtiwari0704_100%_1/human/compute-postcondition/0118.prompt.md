Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `prod` remain the same. `a` has its first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]`. `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is maintained. Otherwise, the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` are as specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is the same, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial list, `prod` is the same, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not modify `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After `bets` iterations, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will have been transformed to `prod // a[i]`. `sumo` will be the sum of all these transformed values. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the condition `sumo >= prod` holds true. Otherwise, the program outputs the string representation of the list `a` as 'a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[bets-1]'. `prod` remains unchanged, and `t`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `l`, and `T` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
