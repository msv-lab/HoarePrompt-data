The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `g` is updated based on the third element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[2] // gcd(l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]), l[2])`; `l` is a list with at least one element; `i` is 2**.
