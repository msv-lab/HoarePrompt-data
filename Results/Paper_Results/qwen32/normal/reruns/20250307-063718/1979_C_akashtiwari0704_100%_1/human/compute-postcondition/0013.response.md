The code provided takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `bets`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial state mentions the function `lcm` and its behavior, as well as the state of variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.**
