Postcondition: **After `bets` iterations, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will have been transformed to `prod // a[i]`. `sumo` will be the sum of all these transformed values, and `sumo` will be greater than or equal to `prod`. `prod` remains unchanged. `t`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `l`, and `T` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.**
