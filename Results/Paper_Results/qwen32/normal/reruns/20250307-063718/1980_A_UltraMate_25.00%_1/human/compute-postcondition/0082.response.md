Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, and `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
