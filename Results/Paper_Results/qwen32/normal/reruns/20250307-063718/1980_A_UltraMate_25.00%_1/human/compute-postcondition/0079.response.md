Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`. If `hmp[i] < m` for some character `i`, then `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`, where `k` is the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is `k * m`.**
