The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. It then computes and prints the minimum number of changes required to ensure that each of the characters 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.
