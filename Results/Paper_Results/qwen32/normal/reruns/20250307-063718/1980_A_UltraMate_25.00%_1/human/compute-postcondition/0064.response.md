The code snippet `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in the new value of `s`, which is the result of the most recent user input string.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new user input string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new value of `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `ans` is 0.**
