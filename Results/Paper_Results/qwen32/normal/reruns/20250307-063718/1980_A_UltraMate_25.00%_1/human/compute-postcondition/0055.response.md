The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. The values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `s`, `hmp`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `i` is `i_next` (the next key in `hmp` after `i_prev`), `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value.**
