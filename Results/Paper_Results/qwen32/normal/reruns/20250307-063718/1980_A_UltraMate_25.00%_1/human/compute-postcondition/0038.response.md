Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is `m`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`. The current value of `i` is not a key in `hmp`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `m`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
