Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, and `ans` is `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
