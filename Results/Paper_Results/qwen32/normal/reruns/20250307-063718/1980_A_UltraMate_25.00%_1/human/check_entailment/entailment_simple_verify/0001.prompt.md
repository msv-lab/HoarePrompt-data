You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds, with each round containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of problems) and `m` (the number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems:**
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will hold the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (note that 'G' is missing here, which is a mistake).
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`, if `i` is not in `hmp` (the counter of problems), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need a problem of this difficulty.
   - It then iterates over each difficulty level in `hmp`. If the count of problems of that difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `ans`.

### Mistakes in the Program

- **Missing 'G':** The string `p` should be `'ABCDEFG'` instead of `'ABCDEF'`. The current implementation does not account for the 'G' difficulty level.
- **Logic for Missing Levels:** The logic for adding `m` to `ans` when a difficulty level is missing is correct, but the missing 'G' will lead to incorrect results.
- **Logic for Insufficient Levels:** The logic for adding the difference when a difficulty level has fewer than `m` problems is correct.

### Corrected Program

To correct the program, we need to include 'G' in the string `p`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Corrected to include 'G'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the missing 'G' in the string `p`. After correcting this, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
