Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for the requirement that each round must contain one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The program currently only checks for the presence of difficulties 'A' to 'F' and does not ensure that each difficulty level is present in each round.

To fix the program, the set of required difficulties should be 'ABCDEFG' instead of 'ABCDEF'. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed should ensure that for each required difficulty, there are enough problems to cover all rounds.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        required_difficulties = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in required_difficulties:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all difficulties from 'A' to 'G' are considered and that the number of additional problems is calculated correctly.
