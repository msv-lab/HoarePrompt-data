The code snippet creates a `Counter` object `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `ans`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new variable `hmp` is added to the state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers read from input where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the input string, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.**
