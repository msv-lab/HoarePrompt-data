Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, and `i` is 'C'. `ans` is increased by `m`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
