Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new user input string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new value of `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `i` is `'B'`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
