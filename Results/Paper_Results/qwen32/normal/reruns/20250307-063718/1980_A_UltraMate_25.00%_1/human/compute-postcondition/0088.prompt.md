Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (updated to the input value); n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `m` remains the same as the input integer.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `s` remains the value of the user input.
- `hmp` remains a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `p` remains `'ABCDEF'`.
- `ans` is updated to `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

In natural language, the final output state is that `n`, `m`, `s`, `hmp`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial values, except `t` is decremented by 1. The variable `ans` is updated to reflect the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` that have a frequency less than `m`, plus `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is the non-empty string, `hmp` is the Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, and `ans` is `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
