Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
