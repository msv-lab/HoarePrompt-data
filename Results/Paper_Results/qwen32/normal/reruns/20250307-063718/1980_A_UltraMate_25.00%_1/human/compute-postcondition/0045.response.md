Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `i` is the next character in `'ABCDEF'` after its current value, and `ans` is `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `0`.**
