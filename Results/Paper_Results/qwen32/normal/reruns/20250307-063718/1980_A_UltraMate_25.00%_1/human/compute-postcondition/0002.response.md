Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers read from input where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
