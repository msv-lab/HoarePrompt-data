The code snippet assigns the string `'ABCDEF'` to the variable `p`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers read from input where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the input string, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEF'**.
