To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given information and compute the value of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `t` is incremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
- `p` is the string `'ABCDEF'`.
- `ans` is calculated as `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The formula for `ans` consists of two parts:
  - `k * m`
  - `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`

However, the variable `k` is not defined in the given initial state. Assuming `k` is a constant or an input variable, we will assume `k` is provided or has a default value. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `k` is a known value, say `k = 1` (since it's not specified, we'll use a common default).

- The term `k * m` is straightforward: multiply the constant `k` by `m`.
- The term `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` calculates the total difference between `m` and the frequency of each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following for a concrete example:
- `m = 3`
- `s = "AABBC"`
- `hmp` will be `Counter({'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 1})`
- `k = 1` (as an example)

Now, let's compute `ans`:
1. `k * m = 1 * 3 = 3`
2. `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`:
   - For 'A': `hmp['A'] = 2` which is not less than `m = 3`, so it contributes `0`.
   - For 'B': `hmp['B'] = 2` which is not less than `m = 3`, so it contributes `0`.
   - For 'C': `hmp['C'] = 1` which is less than `m = 3`, so it contributes `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - Total sum: `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`

So, `ans = 3 + 2 = 5`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the formula for `ans`, the output will be:
Output: **k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m) (where k is a constant, m is the second input integer, hmp is the Counter object with the frequency of each character in the string s)**

Since `k` is not specified, we can't provide a numerical value, but we can describe the formula accurately.

Output: **k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m) (where k is a constant, m is the second input integer, hmp is the Counter object with the frequency of each character in the string s)**
