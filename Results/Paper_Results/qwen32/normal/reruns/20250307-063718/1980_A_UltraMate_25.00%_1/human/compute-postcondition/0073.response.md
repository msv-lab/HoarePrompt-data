The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be updated to its previous value plus `m`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `s`, `hmp`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new user input string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new value of `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `i` is `'B'`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `m`.**
