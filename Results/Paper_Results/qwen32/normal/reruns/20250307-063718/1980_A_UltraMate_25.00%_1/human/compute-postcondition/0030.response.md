In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition. The loop runs `t` times, and the loop variable `_` does not influence the state of the program in a way that affects whether the loop can continue. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `t`.

Given that the loop runs `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, `t` is decremented by 1**
