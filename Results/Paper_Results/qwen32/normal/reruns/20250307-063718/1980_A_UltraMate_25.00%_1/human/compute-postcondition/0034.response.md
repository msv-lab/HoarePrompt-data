Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEF'**.

In this output state, the variable `p` is assigned the string 'ABCDEF'. All other variables retain their initial state values.
