Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new user input string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new value of `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `ans` is `k * m`, where `k` is the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`. If `hmp[i] < m` for some character `i`, then `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`, where `k` is the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is `k * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, and `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
