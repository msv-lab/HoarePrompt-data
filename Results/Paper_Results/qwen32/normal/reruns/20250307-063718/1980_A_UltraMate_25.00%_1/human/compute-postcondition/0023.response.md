The provided code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. Let's determine the new state of `ans` based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: 
- `ans` is calculated as `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF'))))` if `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i]`.
- `hmp` is a set containing at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in the set `hmp`.

The code snippet:
```
ans += m - hmp[i]
```
This means `ans` will be updated to its current value plus `m - hmp[i]`.

Let's consider the two possible initial states for `ans`:

1. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, then initially `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF'))))`.
   After the code execution, `ans` becomes `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i]`.

2. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then initially `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i]`.
   After the code execution, `ans` becomes `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i] + m - hmp[i]`, which simplifies to `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + 2 * m - 2 * hmp[i]`.

Since the exact values of `m`, `hmp`, and `i` are not provided, we can't simplify further. However, we can express the final state of `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` was not less than `m` initially, otherwise `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + 2 * m - 2 * hmp[i]`; `hmp` is a set containing at least one element; `i` is the next element in the set `hmp`.**
