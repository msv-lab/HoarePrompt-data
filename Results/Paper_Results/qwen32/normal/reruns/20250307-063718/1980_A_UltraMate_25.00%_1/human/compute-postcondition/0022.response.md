The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the set `hmp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in the set `hmp`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is calculated based on the condition related to `hmp[i]` and `m`.
- `hmp` is a set containing at least one element.

Since `i` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the set `hmp`. However, we do not know the specific elements in `hmp` or the current value of `i` from the previous iteration, except that `hmp` has at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` as the next element in the set `hmp`. The value of `ans` and the set `hmp` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

State: **`ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF'))))` if `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` is a set containing at least one element. `i` is the next element in the set `hmp`.**
