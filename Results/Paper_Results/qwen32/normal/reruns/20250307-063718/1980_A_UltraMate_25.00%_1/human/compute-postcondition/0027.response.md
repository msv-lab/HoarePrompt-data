Postcondition: **`ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + m - hmp[i] + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` was not less than `m` initially, otherwise `ans` is `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + 2 * m - 2 * hmp[i] + m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` is a set containing at least one element. `i` is `next_i`, where `next_i` is the next element in the set `hmp`.**
