The code snippet provided is `ans += m - hmp[i]`. This line adds the value of `m - hmp[i]` to the variable `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- The expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged.
- `s` is the value of the user input.
- `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must contain at least one character.
- `p` is `'ABCDEF'`.
- `ans` is `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `'ABCDEF'` that are not in `hmp`.
- The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

The line `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `m - hmp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is the value of the user input, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`.**
