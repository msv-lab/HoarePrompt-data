The code snippet provided assigns new values to the variables `n` and `m` by reading an input and splitting it into two integers. The initial state mentions `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` and `t` is decremented by 1, but these expressions do not directly affect the values of `n` and `m` in this snippet.

Here's the output state after the code execution:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, the expression `m * (6 - len(hmp.intersection(set('ABCDEF')))) + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `m` now hold the values input by the user, and `t` has been decreased by 1. The expression involving `hmp` and `m` is still present in the state but its value is not recalculated by this code snippet.
