Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. If the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES', along with three groups: `group_a` containing the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` containing the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` containing the last `nc` elements. If the conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'.**
