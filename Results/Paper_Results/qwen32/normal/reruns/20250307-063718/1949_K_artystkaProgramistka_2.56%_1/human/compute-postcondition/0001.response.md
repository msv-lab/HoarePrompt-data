The code snippet initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The initial state of other variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**
