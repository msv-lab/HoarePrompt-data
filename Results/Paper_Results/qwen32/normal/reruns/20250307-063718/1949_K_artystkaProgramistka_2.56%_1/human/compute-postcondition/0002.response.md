The code snippet initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.**
