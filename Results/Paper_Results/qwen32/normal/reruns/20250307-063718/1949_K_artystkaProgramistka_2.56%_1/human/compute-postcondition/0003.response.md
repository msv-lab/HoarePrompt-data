The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is an element from the list `numbers`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the list `numbers` has at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) are not directly part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `numbers` must have at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
