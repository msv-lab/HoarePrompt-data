Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is an empty list, `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of the original `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements of the original `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements of the original `numbers`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`, and the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to true.**
