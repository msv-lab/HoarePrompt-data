The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has more than one element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element. Since one element has already been processed, `numbers` must now have at least one element remaining for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers to split, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists where one of them now contains the first element of `numbers`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively, with one of them now equal to the first element of `numbers`. `num` is the next element in `numbers`.**
