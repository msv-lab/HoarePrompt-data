Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n`, three integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` representing the sizes of three groups (where `na + nb + nc = n`), and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If the condition specified in `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
