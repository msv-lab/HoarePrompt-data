The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input, but the conditions provided in the initial state regarding the ranges and relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b` remain valid.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are the three integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is not greater than `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`.**
