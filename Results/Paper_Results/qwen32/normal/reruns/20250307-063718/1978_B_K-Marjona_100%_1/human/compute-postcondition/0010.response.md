Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are the three integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is not greater than `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`; `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` is determined as the smaller of the two values: `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
