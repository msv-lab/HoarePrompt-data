The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and prints the result.
