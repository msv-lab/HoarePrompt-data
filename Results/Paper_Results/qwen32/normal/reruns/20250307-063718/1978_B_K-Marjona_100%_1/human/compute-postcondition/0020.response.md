To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and generates its output. The loop iterates `t` times, where each iteration reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and computes the output based on the conditions provided.

The loop's logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`.
4. Otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

The output state after all iterations is simply the sequence of outputs generated by each test case. Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, we can only describe the general form of the output state.

Here's the output state in the required format:

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, where each line is the result of the computation for each test case. For each test case, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `a * n`. Otherwise, the output is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a series of numbers, each corresponding to the result of the computation for a specific test case based on the given conditions.
