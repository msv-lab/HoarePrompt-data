Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns, with the usual price `a` coins per bun. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the `i-th` bun is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the optimal `k` and computes the total profit based on the given prices.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected the formula to include the +1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Calculation of `k`:** The formula `k = min(n, b - a + 1)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that it does not exceed the range where the modified price is higher than the usual price.
2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The total profit is calculated as the sum of the profits from the first `k` buns and the remaining `n - k` buns.

### Edge Cases:
1. **`b <= a`:** All buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. **`b - a + 1 > n`:** All buns can be sold at the modified price.
3. **`b - a + 1 < n`:** Only the first `b - a + 1` buns are sold at the modified price.

### Correctness Check:
Let's go through the example cases provided in the problem statement to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4 + 1) = 2`
   - Profit: `5 * 2 - 2 * (2 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 10 - 1 + 8 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 - 0 + 100 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000 + 1) = 1`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 1) * 1000000000 = 1000000000 - 0 + 999999999 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `1 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 0 - 0 + 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1 + 1) = 1000`
   - Profit: `1000 * 1000 - 1000 * (1000 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 1000) * 1 = 1000000 - 499500 + 0 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases. The logic for calculating `k` and the total profit is accurate.

Correctness: **True**.
