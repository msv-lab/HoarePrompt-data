To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, with the constraints \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).
- The relationship between `a` and `b` is described: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is not greater than `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`.
- `k` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

However, the value of `k` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

This statement will output the product of `a` and `n`. The exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `a` and `n` provided as input.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the integers read from the input)**
