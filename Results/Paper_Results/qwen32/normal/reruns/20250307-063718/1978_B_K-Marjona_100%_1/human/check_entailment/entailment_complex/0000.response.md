### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all his buns under the given promotion rules. The key here is to find the optimal value of `k`, which represents the number of buns sold at the modified price.

The formula used in the program to calculate the maximum profit is as follows:

1. If `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price) is less than or equal to `a` (the usual price of a bun), then the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Thus, the profit is `a * n`.

2. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The formula for the profit in this case is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = b \cdot k - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
   \]
   - `b * k` is the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
   - \(\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}\) is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.
   - `(n - k) * a` is the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The value of `k` is determined as the minimum of `n` and `b - a` to ensure that the price of the buns does not go negative (since the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`).

The program correctly implements this logic for each test case by reading the inputs, calculating the optimal `k`, and then computing the profit using the above formula. The results are printed for each test case.
