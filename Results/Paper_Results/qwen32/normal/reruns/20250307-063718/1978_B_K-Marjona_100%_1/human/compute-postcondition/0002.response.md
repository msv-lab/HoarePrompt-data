Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are the three integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

This means that `k` has been assigned the value of the smaller number between `n` and the difference `b - a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
