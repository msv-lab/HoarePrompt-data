Let's break down the given print statement and understand the values of the variables and expressions involved.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

Given:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Calculate `k`**:
   - `k = min(n, b - a)`

2. **Calculate `b * k`**:
   - This is simply `b` multiplied by `k`.

3. **Calculate `k * (k - 1) // 2`**:
   - This is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is a common formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - This term is subtracted from `b * k`.

4. **Calculate `(n - k) * a`**:
   - This is `a` multiplied by the difference between `n` and `k`.

5. **Combine the results**:
   - The final result to be printed is the sum of `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` and `(n - k) * a`.

### Explanation of the Output:

- **`b * k`**: This term represents `b` repeated `k` times.
- **`k * (k - 1) // 2`**: This term is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is subtracted from `b * k`.
- **`(n - k) * a`**: This term represents `a` repeated `(n - k)` times and is added to the result.

### Final Output:

The print statement will output the calculated value based on the above expressions. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the expression precisely.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**
