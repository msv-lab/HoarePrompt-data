To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided.

**Given:**
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, with \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is not greater than `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

**Expression to evaluate:**
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's analyze each part of the expression:

1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k = min(n, b - a)`

2. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - The expression can be broken down into three parts:
     1. \(b \times k\)
     2. \(-k \times (k - 1) // 2\)
     3. \((n - k) \times a\)

   Let's substitute and simplify:

   - **Part 1: \(b \times k\)**
     - This is the product of `b` and `k`.

   - **Part 2: \(-k \times (k - 1) // 2\)**
     - This term calculates the negative of the sum of the first \(k-1\) integers. The formula \(\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}\) gives the sum of the first \(k-1\) integers. The `//` operator ensures integer division.

   - **Part 3: \((n - k) \times a\)**
     - This is the product of the difference between `n` and `k` and `a`.

3. **Combining the parts:**
   - The entire expression calculates a weighted sum involving `a` and `b` based on the value of `k`.

Given the definition of `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, the expression can be interpreted as a combination of the contributions of `b` and `a` to the total sum, adjusted by the value of `k`.

**Output Description:**
The print statement will output the result of the expression \(b \times k - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a\), where \(k\) is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum value between n and b - a)**
