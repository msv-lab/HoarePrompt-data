The provided code snippet updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` by reading three integers from the input. The initial state specifies that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within a certain range, but the code reassigns them based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are the three integers read from the input, where 1 â‰¤ n, a, b â‰¤ 10^9.**
