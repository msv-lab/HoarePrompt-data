### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price: the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit, i.e., `a * n`.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, then selling some buns at the modified price might yield more profit.
   - The modified price for the first `k` buns decreases linearly from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`.
   - This sum can be calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
   - The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would result in negative or zero prices, which is not feasible.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly determines the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - It then calculates the profit based on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or not.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it outputs `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
