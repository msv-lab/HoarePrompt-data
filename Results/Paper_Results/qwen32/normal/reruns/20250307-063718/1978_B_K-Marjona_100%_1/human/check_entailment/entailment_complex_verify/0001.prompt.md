You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, where each line is the result of the computation for each test case. For each test case, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `a * n`. Otherwise, the output is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob sells buns with a regular price `a` and a promotional price that decreases by 1 coin per bun for the first `k` buns, starting from `b` coins for the first bun. The goal is to maximize the profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Key Points:
1. **Promotional Price Calculation**: The price of the i-th bun for the first `k` buns is `(b - i + 1)`. This is a decreasing sequence starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
2. **Total Profit Calculation**:
   - For the first `k` buns: The total price is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns: The total price is `(n - k) * a`.
3. **Maximizing Profit**:
   - The optimal `k` can be determined by comparing the promotional price against the regular price.
   - If `b <= a`, then there is no benefit in promoting any buns, so `k = 0`.
   - If `b > a`, then `k` should be as large as possible without making the promotional price negative. Thus, `k = min(n, b - a + 1)`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's check the logic in the provided program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Determining `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is almost correct but should be `k = min(n, b - a + 1)` to ensure the promotional price does not go negative.
3. **Calculating Profit**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This is the correct formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series plus the profit from the remaining buns.

### Conclusion:
The program has a small mistake in the calculation of `k`. It should be `k = min(n, b - a + 1)` instead of `k = min(n, b - a)`. However, the provided program does not handle the edge case correctly where `b - a + 1` should be considered.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** due to the incorrect calculation of `k`.

Correctness: **False**
