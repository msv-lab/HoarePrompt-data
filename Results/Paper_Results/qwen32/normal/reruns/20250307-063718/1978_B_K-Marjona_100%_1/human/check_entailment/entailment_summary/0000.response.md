### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic and the execution of the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns under the given promotion strategy.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `b <= a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion price `b` is not beneficial.
   - If `b > a`, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the promotion price, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is because the price of the buns decreases by 1 with each subsequent bun sold under the promotion, and it's only beneficial to sell buns under promotion as long as the price is greater than the usual price `a`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the total profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the total profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the promotion prices for the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `b <= a`, it defaults to selling all buns at the usual price.
     - When `b > a`, it calculates the optimal `k` and computes the total profit accordingly.
   - The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case as described and prints the correct result based on the input values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns under the given promotion strategy.

Correctness: **True**
