You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, where each line is the result of the computation for each test case. For each test case, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `a * n`. Otherwise, the output is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns, with the usual price `a` coins per bun. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the `i-th` bun is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the optimal `k` and computes the total profit based on the given prices.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected the formula to include the +1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Calculation of `k`:** The formula `k = min(n, b - a + 1)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that it does not exceed the range where the modified price is higher than the usual price.
2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The total profit is calculated as the sum of the profits from the first `k` buns and the remaining `n - k` buns.

### Edge Cases:
1. **`b <= a`:** All buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. **`b - a + 1 > n`:** All buns can be sold at the modified price.
3. **`b - a + 1 < n`:** Only the first `b - a + 1` buns are sold at the modified price.

### Correctness Check:
Let's go through the example cases provided in the problem statement to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4 + 1) = 2`
   - Profit: `5 * 2 - 2 * (2 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 10 - 1 + 8 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 - 0 + 100 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000 + 1) = 1`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 1) * 1000000000 = 1000000000 - 0 + 999999999 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `1 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 0 - 0 + 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1 + 1) = 1000`
   - Profit: `1000 * 1000 - 1000 * (1000 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 1000) * 1 = 1000000 - 499500 + 0 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases. The logic for calculating `k` and the total profit is accurate.

Correctness: **True**.
