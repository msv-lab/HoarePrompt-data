The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This operation does not change any preconditions about the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` other than assigning them the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are the three integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is not greater than `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`. `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
