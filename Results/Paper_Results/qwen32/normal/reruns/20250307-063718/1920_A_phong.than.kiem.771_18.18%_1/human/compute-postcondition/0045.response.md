Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `count_num` is 1, and `i` is such that `start <= i <= end`.**

In simple terms: The value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
