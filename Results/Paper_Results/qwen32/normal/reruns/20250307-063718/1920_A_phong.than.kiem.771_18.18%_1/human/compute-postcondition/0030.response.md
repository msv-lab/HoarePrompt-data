The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. This directly impacts the values of `t` and `v` but does not affect the other variables (`n`, `i`, `start`, `num`) unless their values are dependent on `t` and `v` as per the initial conditions provided.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the variables are affected:
- `t` and `v` are reassigned to the values read from the input.
- `n`, `i`, `start`, and `num` remain unchanged unless their values are dependent on `t` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `start` is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made.**
