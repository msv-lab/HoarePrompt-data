### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the functions involved:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function is not used in the provided code snippet. It seems to be a placeholder or a utility function that reads an integer input from the user or returns 1 based on a boolean flag. However, it is not invoked in the main execution flow.

2. **Function `func_2`:** Similar to `func_1`, this function is not used in the provided code snippet. It reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, and optionally converts them to integers. Again, it is not part of the main execution.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function concatenates elements of a list into a single string with a specified separator. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

4. **Function `func_4`:** This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

5. **Function `func_5`:** This function finds all indices of a specific element within a list. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

6. **Function `func_6`:** This function searches for a sublist within a list of lists that contains a specific value at a given index. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

7. **Function `func_7`:** This function is the core of the solution. It processes each test case by reading the number of constraints and their types. It then calculates the range of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates the `start` of the range.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates the `end` of the range.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`k != x`), it collects these values in a list `num`.
   
   After processing all constraints, it checks if the calculated range `[start, end]` is valid (i.e., `start <= end`). If the range is invalid, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in the list `num` and returns this count.

### Correctness:

The logic implemented in `func_7` correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles the constraints of type 1 and 2 to determine the valid range and constraints of type 3 to exclude specific values within that range. The function also correctly handles the case where the range is invalid by returning 0.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
