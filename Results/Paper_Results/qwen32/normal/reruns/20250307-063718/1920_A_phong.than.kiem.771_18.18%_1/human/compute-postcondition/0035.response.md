Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, `start` is updated to the value of `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` was not less than `v`, no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made. If `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is updated to the value of `v`.**
