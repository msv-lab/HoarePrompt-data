Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads multiple test cases, processes the constraints for each test case, and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all the constraints. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Processing**: For each constraint, it updates the range of possible values for \( k \) based on the type of constraint:
   - Type 1 constraints update the lower bound.
   - Type 2 constraints update the upper bound.
   - Type 3 constraints are stored in a list to be checked later.
3. **Validation**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if the updated range is valid (i.e., the lower bound is not greater than the upper bound).
4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**: It counts how many of the forbidden values (from type 3 constraints) fall within the valid range and subtracts this count from the total number of possible values in the range.
5. **Output**: The program outputs the number of valid integers \( k \) for each test case.

The logic for handling the constraints and calculating the result is correct and matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
