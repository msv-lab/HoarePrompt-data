The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently `i_end + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 2`. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need `i` to be `i_end + 1` at the start of the iteration, so we set `i` to `i_end + 1`.

The value of `n` does not change based on the loop head and remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `start` is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made.**
