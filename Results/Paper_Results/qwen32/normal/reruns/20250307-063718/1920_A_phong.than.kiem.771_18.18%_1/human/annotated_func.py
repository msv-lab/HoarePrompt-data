#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer provided by the user. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.

If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings split by spaces from `line`, and each substring is converted to an integer. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`, and each character is converted to an integer.

        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`. Since `to_int` is `False`, no conversion to integers occurs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is `True`, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `False`, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is `False`, the elements are returned as they are without conversion.

    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations, `string` will be a single string containing all elements of `arr` converted to strings and joined by the string `sym`. The variable `i` will hold the last element of `arr` after the loop completes. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `string`.
    #
    #Output State:

    #The program returns a single string that contains all elements of `arr` converted to strings and joined by the string `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of values and a string `sym`, and returns a single string that consists of the string representations of the elements in `arr` joined by the string `sym`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list containing all starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the list is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find and return the first sublist that contains a specified `value` at a given `index`. If no such sublist is found, it returns `None`.
