The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num` list and the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next element in `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `num` after the current `i`.

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

To clarify, if `i` was the current element in the previous iteration, the next iteration will have `i` as the subsequent element in the `num` list. Since we don't have the specific values of `num` or the current `i`, we can only describe the state in terms of `i` being the next element in `num`.
