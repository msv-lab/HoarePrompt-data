Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is -1; `end` is 1000000000.0; `num` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. If `t` equals 2, then `start` is updated to `v` if `v` is greater than the original `start` (which is -1), otherwise `start` remains -1, and `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000.0. `num` remains an empty list. If `t` equals 3, `start` remains -1, `end` remains 1000000000.0, and `num` is a list containing the element `v`. If `t` does not equal 2 or 3, `start` remains -1, `end` remains 1000000000.0, and `num` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `start` is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, `start` is updated to the value of `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` was not less than `v`, no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions except that if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is updated to the value of `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
