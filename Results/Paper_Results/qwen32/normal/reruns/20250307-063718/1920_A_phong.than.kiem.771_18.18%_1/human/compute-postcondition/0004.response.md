To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is the loop variable, and `n` determines the number of iterations. 

Given that `n` is already an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, this condition is already satisfied for the loop to execute at least once. The variables `start`, `end`, and `num` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `n` is within the specified range, and `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop begins since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list**
