The function `func_7` does not accept any explicit parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. It operates based on predefined variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num`. The functionality involves checking certain conditions and returning a value based on those conditions.

Functionality: **The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.**
