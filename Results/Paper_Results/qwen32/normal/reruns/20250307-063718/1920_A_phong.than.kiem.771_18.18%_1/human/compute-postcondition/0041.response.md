In the given task, the for loop iterates over the list `num`. The loop will execute if `num` contains at least one element. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `num` to ensure that it has at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `count_num` is 0**
