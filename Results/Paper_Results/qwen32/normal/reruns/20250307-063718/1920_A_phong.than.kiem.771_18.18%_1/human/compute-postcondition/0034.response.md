The given code snippet assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other preconditions intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, `start` is updated to the value of `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` was not less than `v`, no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v` as its last element. Otherwise, no changes beyond the initial conditions are made. `end` is `v`.**
