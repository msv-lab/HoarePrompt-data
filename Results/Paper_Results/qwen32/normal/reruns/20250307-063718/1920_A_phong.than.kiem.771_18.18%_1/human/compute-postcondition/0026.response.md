Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `start` is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions.**
