Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num`, `count_num` is `count_num` + 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, and `i`) retain their previous values.
