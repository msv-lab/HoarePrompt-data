The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. This means that the list `num` will now contain `v` as its last element. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, and `start` remain unchanged. The only change is to the list `num`, which gains a new element `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `start` is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions. `num` contains `v` as its last element.**
