The given code snippet initializes a new variable `count_num` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, or `num`, as these variables are not modified in the provided code.

Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0.**
