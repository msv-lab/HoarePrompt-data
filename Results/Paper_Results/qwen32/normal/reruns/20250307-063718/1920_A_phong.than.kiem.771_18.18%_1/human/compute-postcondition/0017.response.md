The code snippet `num.append(v)` adds the value `v` to the end of the list `num`. Since `num` was initially an empty list, after appending `v`, `num` will contain one element, which is `v`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` equals 3, `start` remains -1, `end` remains 1000000000.0, and `num` is a list containing the element `v`.**
