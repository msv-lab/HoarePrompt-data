You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Output hints for function number 7 : The function reads a series of constraints and calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a list of specific values. It returns the count of such integers if the range is valid; otherwise, it returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the constraints. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the overlap and exclusion of ranges defined by the constraints.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.
   - It then iterates through each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and x.
     - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and x.
     - For type 3 constraints (k must be not equal to x), it adds x to the `num` list.

2. **Counting Valid k Values**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program calculates the total number of valid k values as `end - start + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the count of numbers in the `num` list that fall within this range.
   - However, the logic for subtracting the count of numbers in the `num` list is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where multiple numbers in the `num` list fall within the range, especially if there are overlapping or adjacent numbers.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1
     2 5
     3 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     - Here, k must be between 1 and 5 (inclusive) and cannot be 2, 3, or 4.
     - The valid k values are 1 and 5.
     - The program will calculate `end - start + 1` as 5 and subtract the count of numbers in the `num` list that fall within this range, which is 3.
     - However, the correct answer should be 2 (1 and 5), but the program will return 2 (5 - 3), which is incorrect because it does not handle the overlap correctly.

4. **Specific Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple numbers in the `num` list fall within the range. It simply subtracts the count of numbers in the `num` list, which can lead to incorrect results if there are overlapping or adjacent numbers.

To fix this issue, the program should use a more robust method to handle the exclusion of numbers, such as using a set to store the numbers to be excluded and then iterating through the range to count the valid k values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the exclusion of numbers within the range.
