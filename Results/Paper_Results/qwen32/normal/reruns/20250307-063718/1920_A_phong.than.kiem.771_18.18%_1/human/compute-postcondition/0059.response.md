Output State: **The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.**

This means that the program calculates the difference between the maximum value (`end`) and the minimum value (`start`) encountered for `v` when `t` is 2 and 1, respectively, adds 1 to this difference, and then subtracts the count of `v` values (`count_num`) that fall within the range `[start, end]` when `t` is 3. If the result of this calculation is non-negative, it returns that value; otherwise, it returns 0.
