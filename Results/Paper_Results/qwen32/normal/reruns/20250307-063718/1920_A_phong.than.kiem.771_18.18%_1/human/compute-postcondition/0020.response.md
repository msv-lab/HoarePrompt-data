The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `t` and `v` after converting them to integers. The initial state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
