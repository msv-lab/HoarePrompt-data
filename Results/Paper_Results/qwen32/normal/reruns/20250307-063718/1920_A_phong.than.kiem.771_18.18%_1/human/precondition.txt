isOne is a boolean value. However, based on the problem description provided, the function `input_n` does not seem to match the description of the problem. The input consists of multiple test cases with constraints on integer k, and the function definition does not reflect this. The correct function definition should accept the number of test cases and the constraints for each test case. Therefore, a more appropriate precondition would be: the input consists of multiple test cases where each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a (1 ≤ a ≤ 3) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the type and value of the constraint, respectively. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
