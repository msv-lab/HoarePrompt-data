Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is `v`, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are the two integers read from the input, and `t` equals 1. The current value of `v` is greater than `start`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
