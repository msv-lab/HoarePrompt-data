### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. The constraints can be of three types:
1. \( k \geq x \)
2. \( k \leq x \)
3. \( k \neq x \)

The program reads the input, processes the constraints, and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It then reads each constraint, which consists of a type \( a \) and a value \( x \).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000. These represent the range of possible values for \( k \).
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (\( k \geq x \)), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (\( k \leq x \)), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (\( k \neq x \)), it adds \( x \) to a list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - It initializes `count_num` to 0, which counts the number of integers in the range \([start, end]\) that are not equal to any value in `num`.
   - It iterates through each value in `num` and checks if it lies within the range \([start, end]\). If it does, it increments `count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because the range is invalid.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`. This formula calculates the total number of integers in the range \([start, end]\) and subtracts the count of integers that are not allowed (i.e., those in `num`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the range \([start, end]\) is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) by returning 0.
   - It also ensures that the count of invalid integers (`count_num`) does not exceed the total number of integers in the range.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints. It handles the edge cases appropriately and provides the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
