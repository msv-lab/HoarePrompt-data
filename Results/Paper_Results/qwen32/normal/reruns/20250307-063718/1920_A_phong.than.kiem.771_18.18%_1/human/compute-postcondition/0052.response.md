Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged.
