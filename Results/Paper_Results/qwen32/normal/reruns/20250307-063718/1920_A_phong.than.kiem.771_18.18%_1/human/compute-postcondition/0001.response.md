The code snippet provided does not actually change the value of `start` as it is already initialized to `-1`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the code explicitly sets `start` to `-1` again, which does not alter its value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is -1; `end` is 1000000000.0; `num` is a list that will store integers (values of x for constraints of type 3).**
