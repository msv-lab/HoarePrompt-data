Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return 1 or an integer input from the user. If isOne is False, the function reads and returns an integer from the input. If isOne is True, the function returns the integer 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input from the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer provided by the user. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into items based on spaces, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean, `to_int` is a boolean, `line` is the input string. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers where each element is an integer conversion of the corresponding element in `items`. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings split by spaces from `line`, and each substring is converted to an integer. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`, and each character is converted to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`. Since `to_int` is `False`, no conversion to integers occurs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is `True`, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `False`, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is `False`, the elements are returned as they are without conversion.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values, and sym is a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of values that must have `n` elements, `sym` is a string, `string` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `arr` with `sym` inserted between each pair of elements, and `i` is the last element of `arr`.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations, `string` will be a single string containing all elements of `arr` converted to strings and joined by the string `sym`. The variable `i` will hold the last element of `arr` after the loop completes. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `string`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return string
    #The program returns a single string that contains all elements of `arr` converted to strings and joined by the string `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of values and a string `sym`, and returns a single string that consists of the string representations of the elements in `arr` joined by the string `sym`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, and substring is a string.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)

        indices.append(index)

    return indices
    #The program returns a list `indices` containing all starting indices of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list containing all starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the list is empty.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element is a value that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the value of `element` is found in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` and a value `element`, and returns a list of indices where `element` is found within `arr`. If `element` is not present in `arr`, it returns an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is a non-negative integer, and value is a value of any type.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The loop has iterated over all subarrays in `arr` and has not found a `subArray` such that `subArray[index] == value`. The function does not return anything, and the state of `arr`, `index`, and `value` remains unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find and return the first sublist that contains a specified `value` at a given `index`. If no such sublist is found, it returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is an integer initialized to -1, end is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, num is a list that will store integers (values of x for constraints of type 3).

    #The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of constraints and calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a list of specific values. It returns the count of such integers if the range is valid; otherwise, it returns 0.
