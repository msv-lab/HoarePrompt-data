To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables `start`, `end`, and `num` are updated based on the input values `t` and `v` over `n` iterations.

Here's a breakdown of how the variables change in each iteration:

1. **`start`**: This variable is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
2. **`end`**: This variable is updated to the value of `v` if `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **`num`**: This variable is updated to include `v` at the end of the list if `t` is 3. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given that `n` iterations occur, the final state of `start` will be the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, the final state of `end` will be the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, and `num` will be a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3.

### Final Output State

**Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, and `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `start` will hold the largest number provided when `t` was 1.
- `end` will hold the smallest number provided when `t` was 2.
- `num` will be a list of all numbers provided when `t` was 3.
