Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. If `t` equals 2, then `start` is updated to `v` if `v` is greater than the original `start` (which is -1), otherwise `start` remains -1, and `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000.0. `num` remains an empty list. If `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains -1, `end` remains 1000000000.0, and `num` remains an empty list.**
