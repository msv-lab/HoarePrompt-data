You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. The constraints can be of three types:
1. \( k \geq x \)
2. \( k \leq x \)
3. \( k \neq x \)

The program reads the input, processes the constraints, and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It then reads each constraint, which consists of a type \( a \) and a value \( x \).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000. These represent the range of possible values for \( k \).
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (\( k \geq x \)), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (\( k \leq x \)), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (\( k \neq x \)), it adds \( x \) to a list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - It initializes `count_num` to 0, which counts the number of integers in the range \([start, end]\) that are not equal to any value in `num`.
   - It iterates through each value in `num` and checks if it lies within the range \([start, end]\). If it does, it increments `count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because the range is invalid.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`. This formula calculates the total number of integers in the range \([start, end]\) and subtracts the count of integers that are not allowed (i.e., those in `num`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the range \([start, end]\) is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) by returning 0.
   - It also ensures that the count of invalid integers (`count_num`) does not exceed the total number of integers in the range.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints. It handles the edge cases appropriately and provides the correct output for the given examples.
