Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1.**
