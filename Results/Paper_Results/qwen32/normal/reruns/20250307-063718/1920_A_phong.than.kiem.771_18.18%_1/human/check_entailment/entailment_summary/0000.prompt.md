Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer provided by the user. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is `True`, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `False`, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is `False`, the elements are returned as they are without conversion.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function takes a list `arr` of values and a string `sym`, and returns a single string that consists of the string representations of the elements in `arr` joined by the string `sym`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list containing all starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the list is empty.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function takes a list `arr` and a value `element`, and returns a list of indices where `element` is found within `arr`. If `element` is not present in `arr`, it returns an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find and return the first sublist that contains a specified `value` at a given `index`. If no such sublist is found, it returns `None`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    if start > end:
        return 0
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a series of constraints and calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a list of specific values. It returns the count of such integers if the range is valid; otherwise, it returns 0.
