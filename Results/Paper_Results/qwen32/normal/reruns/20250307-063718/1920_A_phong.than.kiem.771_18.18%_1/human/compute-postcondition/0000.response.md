The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`. Since the code reassigns `n` with the input value, the new value of `n` will be the integer provided by the user, which must still satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 100`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 (as provided by the user input); `start` is -1; `end` is 1000000000.0; `num` is a list that will store integers (values of x for constraints of type 3).**
