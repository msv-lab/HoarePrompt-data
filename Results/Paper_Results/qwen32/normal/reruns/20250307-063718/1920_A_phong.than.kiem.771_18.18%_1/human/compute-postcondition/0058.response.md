Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.**
