Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has at least one element, `count_num` is 0. The current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**
