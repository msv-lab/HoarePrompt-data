### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not called in the main program as provided. It seems to be intended to handle input, but it is not used. The main program directly reads the number of test cases using `int(input())`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input, optionally splits it into items, and optionally converts those items to integers. It is not used in the main program.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function concatenates elements of a list with a given symbol. It is not used in the main program.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the main program.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function returns indices of a given element in a list. It is not used in the main program.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function searches for a subarray in a list of arrays where a specific index matches a given value. It is not used in the main program.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function is the core of the solution. It processes each test case. It reads the number of constraints, then processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint type is 1, it updates the `start` variable to the maximum of its current value and the constraint value.
   - If the constraint type is 2, it updates the `end` variable to the minimum of its current value and the constraint value.
   - If the constraint type is 3, it adds the constraint value to the `num` list.
   
   After processing all constraints, it checks if `start > end`, which would mean there are no valid `k` values, and returns 0 in that case. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` from the total range size `end - start + 1`.

8. **Main Program**: The main program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_7` to compute the number of valid `k` values and prints the result.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It correctly handles the constraints:
- It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It counts the values of `k` that are excluded due to constraints of type 3.
- It calculates the number of valid `k` values by considering the range `[start, end]` and subtracting the count of excluded values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
