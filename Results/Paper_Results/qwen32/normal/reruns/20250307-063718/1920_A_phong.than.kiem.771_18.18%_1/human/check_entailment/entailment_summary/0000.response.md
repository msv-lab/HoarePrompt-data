### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. The constraints can be of three types: \( k \geq x \), \( k \leq x \), or \( k \neq x \). The program processes multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints, and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \).

The provided code consists of several functions, but the core functionality of the program is encapsulated in `func_7`. Here's a breakdown of how `func_7` works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Reading Constraints**:
   - The function reads an integer \( n \) which is the number of constraints.
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \( 10^9 \). These represent the inclusive range of possible values for \( k \).
   - It initializes an empty list `num` to store the values that \( k \) must not equal.

2. **Processing Each Constraint**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type \( t \) and the value \( v \).
   - If \( t = 1 \) (k must be greater than or equal to \( x \)), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and \( v \).
   - If \( t = 2 \) (k must be less than or equal to \( x \)), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and \( v \).
   - If \( t = 3 \) (k must not be equal to \( x \)), it adds \( v \) to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values**:
   - It initializes `count_num` to 0.
   - It iterates through the `num` list and increments `count_num` for each value in `num` that lies within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Calculating Valid Integers**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid range, so it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts `count_num` (the number of invalid values) from it.
   - It ensures that the result is not negative by returning 0 if the calculated value is less than 0.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the constraints of type 1 and 2 by adjusting the `start` and `end` variables.
- It correctly handles the constraints of type 3 by counting how many of the excluded values lie within the valid range.
- The function ensures that the result is not negative by returning 0 if the calculated number of valid integers is less than 0.
- The function handles the edge cases where there are no valid integers (e.g., when `start > end` after processing all constraints).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Since the other functions (`func_1` to `func_6`) are not directly involved in the core logic of solving the problem and are not misused, the entire program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
