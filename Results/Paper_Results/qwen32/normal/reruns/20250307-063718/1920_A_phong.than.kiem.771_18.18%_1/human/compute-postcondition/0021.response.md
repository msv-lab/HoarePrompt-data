The code snippet assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `start` is the value of `v`.**
