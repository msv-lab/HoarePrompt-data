The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is `True`, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `False`, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is `False`, the elements are returned as they are without conversion.
