Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has at least one element, `count_num` is 0, and the current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states.
