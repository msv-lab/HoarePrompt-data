The code snippet provided does not change the value of `end` as it is already assigned the value `1000000000.0`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `start`, `num`, and `end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is -1; `end` is 1000000000.0; `num` is a list that will store integers (values of x for constraints of type 3).**
