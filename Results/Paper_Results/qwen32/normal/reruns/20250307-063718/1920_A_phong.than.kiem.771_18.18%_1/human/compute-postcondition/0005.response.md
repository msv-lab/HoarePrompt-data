The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
