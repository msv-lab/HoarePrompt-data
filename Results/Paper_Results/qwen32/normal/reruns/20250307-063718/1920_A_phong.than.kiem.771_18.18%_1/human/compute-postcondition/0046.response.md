Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has at least one element. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is set to 1 and `i` is such that `start <= i <= end`.**
