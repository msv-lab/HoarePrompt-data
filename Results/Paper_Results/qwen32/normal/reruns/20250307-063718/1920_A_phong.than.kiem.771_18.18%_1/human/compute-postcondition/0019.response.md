The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's denote it as `i_end`), and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `i_end + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Since the problem statement does not provide the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_end + 1`, where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
