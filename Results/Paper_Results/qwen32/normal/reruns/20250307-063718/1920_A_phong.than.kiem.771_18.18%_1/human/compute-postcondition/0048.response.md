Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num` and we continue to the next iteration.**

The values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
