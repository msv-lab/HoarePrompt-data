The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num` list and the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of the `num` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must have at least one more element that `i` can take. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in the `num` list.

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num` after the last iteration**.

Since we don't have the specific values of `num` and `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state in a general form where `i` is adjusted to the next element in `num`.

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3 and has more than one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.
