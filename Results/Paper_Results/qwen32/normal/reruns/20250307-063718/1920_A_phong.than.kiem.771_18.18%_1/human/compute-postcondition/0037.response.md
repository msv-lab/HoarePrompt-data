The given code snippet is `num.append(v)`. This line of code appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. 

Based on the initial state, `num` is a list that could potentially contain elements, and `v` is the second integer from the input. After the execution of the code, `num` will have `v` as its last element, as specified in the initial conditions when `t` is 3.

The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged by this line of code. The conditions for `start` and `end` are not affected since the code only modifies `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` contains `v` as its last element. If `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, `start` is updated to the value of `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` was not less than `v`, no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, no additional changes are specified beyond the initial conditions except that if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is updated to the value of `v`.**
