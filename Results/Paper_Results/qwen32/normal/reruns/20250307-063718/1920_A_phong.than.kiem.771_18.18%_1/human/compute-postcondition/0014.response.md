Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is updated to `v` if `v` is greater than the original `start` (which is -1), otherwise `start` remains -1, `end` is `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` equals 2, and `v` is an integer.**
