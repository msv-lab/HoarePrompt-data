The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `num` becomes either 3 or 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input, `num` is either 3 or 4, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1.**
