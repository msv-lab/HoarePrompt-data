To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game on an \( n \times n \) chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The player starts by placing white rooks, and the computer responds by placing black rooks in a mirrored position. The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves by the player and the corresponding computer moves.

### Key Points
1. **Mirroring Rule**: If a player places a rook at position \((r, c)\), the computer places a rook at \((c, r)\) unless \(r = c\), in which case the computer skips its turn.
2. **Valid Moves**: A move is valid if it does not attack any previously placed rook.
3. **Final Configurations**: We need to count the number of unique configurations possible after all valid moves are exhausted.

### Implementation Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
2. **Counting Moves**: It counts the number of moves that result in the computer skipping its turn (i.e., when \( r = c \)) and those that do not.
3. **Remaining Slots Calculation**: It calculates the remaining slots \( m \) where rooks can be placed.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: It uses a DP array to compute the number of ways to place the remaining rooks. The DP transition formula is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This formula calculates the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks on the remaining slots.

### Verification
- **Base Cases**:
  - When \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), there is only one way to place the rooks.
- **DP Transition**:
  - The DP transition formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks considering the mirroring rule.
- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The results are taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
