Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num`, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.

In simple terms, the value of `num` has been increased by 2, so `num` is now 2. The value of `m` is recalculated as `n - num`, which means `m` is now `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
