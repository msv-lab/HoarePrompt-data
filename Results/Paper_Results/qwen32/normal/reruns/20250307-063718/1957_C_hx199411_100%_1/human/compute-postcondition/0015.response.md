The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `num` is initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, and 2 otherwise. After the increment, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 3, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `i` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
