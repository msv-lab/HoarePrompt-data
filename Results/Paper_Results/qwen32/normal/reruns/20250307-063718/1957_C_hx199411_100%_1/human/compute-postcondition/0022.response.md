To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `num` based on the values of `c` and `r` for each iteration. The loop runs `k` times, and for each iteration, it increments `num` by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can generalize the behavior:

1. For each iteration, `num` is incremented by either 1 or 2.
2. After `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of these increments.

Let's denote the total number of times `c` equals `r` as `x`. Therefore, `c` does not equal `r` for `k - x` iterations. The final value of `num` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{num} = x \cdot 1 + (k - x) \cdot 2 = x + 2k - 2x = 2k - x \]

This means `num` is incremented by 2 for each of the `k` iterations, minus the number of times `c` equals `r` (since those times it only increments by 1 instead of 2).

The final output state after all `k` iterations is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, and `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.**

In simpler terms, `num` is the total count of increments, which is `2k - x`, where `x` is the number of times `c` equals `r` during the `k` iterations.
