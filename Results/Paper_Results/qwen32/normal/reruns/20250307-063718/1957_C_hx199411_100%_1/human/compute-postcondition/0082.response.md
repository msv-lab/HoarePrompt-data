To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0. This tells us that `t` is a positive integer, but its exact value isn't relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input. Its value is not relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input. Its value is not relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c == r` or not across all `k` iterations. Its value is not relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement.
- `m` is 8.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific values assigned to `dp[1]` through `dp[8]`.

Given that `m` is 8, the statement `print(dp[m])` translates to `print(dp[8])`.

From the initial state, we know that `dp[8]` is assigned the value 5937.

Therefore, the output of the `print(dp[m])` statement will be the value of `dp[8]`, which is 5937.

Output: **5937**
