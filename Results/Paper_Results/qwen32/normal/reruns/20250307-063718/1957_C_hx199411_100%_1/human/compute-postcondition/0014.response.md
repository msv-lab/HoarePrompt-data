The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` was initially 1, and if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` was initially 2. After the increment, if `c` was equal to `r`, `num` becomes 2, and if `c` was not equal to `r`, `num` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1.**
