The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5. The variable `m` does not need to be adjusted since it is dependent on the values of `n` and `num`, which are not part of the loop head and have already been established.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5, and `m` remains as it is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 5**
