You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the problem and the program's approach to solving it.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an n x n chessboard where two players take turns placing rooks. The first player (you) places white rooks, and the second player (the computer) places black rooks by mirroring your moves. The goal is to find the number of distinct final configurations of the board after all valid moves have been played.

### Key Points:
1. **Mirroring Moves**: When you place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r). If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
2. **No Two Rooks Attack Each Other**: Rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column as another rook.
3. **Final Configurations**: We need to count the number of distinct ways to place the remaining rooks on the board after k initial moves.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, the answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the board) and `k` (the number of moves already played).
   - It then reads the `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `r` and `c`.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - The program counts the number of moves that result in the computer skipping its turn (`r == c`) and those that do not (`r != c`).
   - If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn, so only one rook is placed. Otherwise, two rooks are placed (one by you and one by the computer).

3. **Calculating Remaining Slots**:
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the total number of rooks placed after `k` moves.
   - The remaining slots available for placing rooks are `m = n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations**:
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, there is only one way to place the remaining rooks.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of distinct configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Verification

The dynamic programming approach seems to correctly model the problem. The recurrence relation is designed to account for the ways to place rooks in the remaining slots while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem. It handles the base cases and uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of distinct final configurations for larger values of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
