Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c == r` or not across all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not 0. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.**
