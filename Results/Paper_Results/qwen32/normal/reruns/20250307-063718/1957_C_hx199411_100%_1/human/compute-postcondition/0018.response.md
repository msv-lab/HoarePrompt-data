The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` have specific values, and `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `c` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input after `n` and `k`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
