The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Initially, `num` is 0, so after the operation, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.
