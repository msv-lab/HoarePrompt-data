The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` was initially 0, so after the increment, `num` becomes 1. The value of `m` is `n - num`, and since `num` has changed from 0 to 1, `m` will now be `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 1, `m` is `n - 1`, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input, and `c` equals `r`.**
