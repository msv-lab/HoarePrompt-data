Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly account for all possible final configurations of the chessboard. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Counting Moves**: The program correctly counts the number of moves (`num`) that have already been made and their implications on the board. It increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), and by 2 otherwise.

2. **Remaining Slots (`m`)**: The program calculates the remaining slots (`m`) on the board where rooks can be placed. This is done by subtracting `num` from `n`.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining slots. The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill in the DP table up to `dp[m]`.

However, the transition formula and the base cases do not accurately represent the problem's requirements for counting the configurations of rooks on the board. Specifically:

- **Base Case for `dp[2]`**: The base case `dp[2] = 3` is incorrect. When there are 2 remaining slots, the possible configurations are:
  - Place a white rook in the first slot and a black rook in the second.
  - Place a black rook in the first slot and a white rook in the second.
  - Place a white rook in the first slot and a white rook in the second (and similarly for black rooks).
  This results in 4 configurations, not 3.

- **Transition Formula**: The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly account for the placement of rooks. The factor of 2 in the formula seems to be incorrect and does not accurately represent the choices available for placing rooks.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider a 4x4 board with 1 move already made at (1, 2). The correct number of configurations should be 3, as described in the problem statement. However, the program calculates the number of configurations incorrectly due to the flawed DP formula and base cases.

To fix the program, the base cases and transition formula should be revised to accurately reflect the problem's requirements for counting the configurations of rooks on the board.
