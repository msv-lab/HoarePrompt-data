Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 1` if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `n - 2`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input, and `r` is the second integer read from the input.**
