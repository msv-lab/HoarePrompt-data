The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. The values of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.**
