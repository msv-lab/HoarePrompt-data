The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3 because the loop starts with `i = 3` and goes up to `m + 1`.

Given the current state, `m` is in the range `[n - 2k, n - k]` and `m` is not 0 or 1. To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be at least 3. Therefore, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 3. 

The state `t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]` do not affect the loop execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is 3**
