The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, so we need to compute `dp[5]` using the values of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]`.

Given:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25

Using the formula:
```
dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81
```

The value of `dp[5]` is now 81. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the other elements of `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81, `i` is 5**
