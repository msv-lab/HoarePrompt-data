The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `i-1` before it was incremented), and `k` is a constant value that does not change.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration to occur, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we will assume it was `i-1` and now it is `i`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is `i+1`**

To make it more concrete, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is 3**

Generalizing, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `i`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `i+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is `i+1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate state we can describe is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
