The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `k` must be such that `i` is still less than `k`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0
- `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`
- `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`
- If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is set to 2. If `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is set to 3 and `i` is incremented by 1

Since the loop is `for i in range(k)`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `i` is incremented by 1**
