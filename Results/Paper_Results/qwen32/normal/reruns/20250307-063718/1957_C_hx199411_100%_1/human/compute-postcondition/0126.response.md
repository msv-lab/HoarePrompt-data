Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`. If `m` is 0, `dp` is unchanged unless `m` is 0, 1, or 8. If `m` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged unless `m` is 8. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 331, `dp[7]` which is 1303, `dp[8]` which is 5937, `dp[9]` which is 26785, `dp[10]` which is 133651, and `i` is `m + 1`.**
