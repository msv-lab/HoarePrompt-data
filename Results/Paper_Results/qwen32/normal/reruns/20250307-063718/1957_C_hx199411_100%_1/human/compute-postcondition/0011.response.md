Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input after `n` and `k`, `r` is the second integer read from the input after `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
