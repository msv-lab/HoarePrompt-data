The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and since the loop is still executing, it means `i` was less than `m`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 4. The value of `m` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**
