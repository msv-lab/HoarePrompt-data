Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `m` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is explicitly printing the integer `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
