Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c == r` or not across all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made to `dp`. If `m` is 1, `dp` is a list of length 2 with `dp[1]` as 1. If `m` is 8, `dp` is a list of length 9 with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, `dp[3]` as 7, `dp[4]` as 25, `dp[5]` as 81, `dp[6]` as 331, `dp[7]` as 1303, and `dp[8]` as 5937.**
