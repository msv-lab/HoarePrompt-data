Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**

In natural language: The value of `dp[2]` has been updated to 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
