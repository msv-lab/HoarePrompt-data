To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 because the `range(k)` function will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `k`. If `k` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `num` is 0.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range(k)` function. However, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is greater than 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and `num` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is 0**
