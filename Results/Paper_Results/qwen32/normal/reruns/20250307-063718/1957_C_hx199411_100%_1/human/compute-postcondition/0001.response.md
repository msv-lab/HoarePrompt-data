The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the loop will certainly execute at least once because the minimum value of `t` is 1.

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be in a range that allows the loop to execute at least once, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
