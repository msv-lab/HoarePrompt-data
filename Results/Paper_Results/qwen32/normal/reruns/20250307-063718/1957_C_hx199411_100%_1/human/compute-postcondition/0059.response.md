The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` in the if part, otherwise `num` is 3 in the else part, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 2` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 3`), and if `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
