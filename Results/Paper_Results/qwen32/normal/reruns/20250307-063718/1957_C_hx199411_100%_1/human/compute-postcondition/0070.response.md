The given Python code snippet contains a `print(1)` statement. This statement will simply print the integer `1` to the console. The initial state provided does not affect the value that is printed by this statement because the `print(1)` is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `dp`), but these are not used in the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement is a direct instruction to output the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
