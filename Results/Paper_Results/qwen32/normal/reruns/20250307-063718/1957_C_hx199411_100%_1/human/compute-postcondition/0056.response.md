The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `num` will be either 2 or 3.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 2` if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `n - 3`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
