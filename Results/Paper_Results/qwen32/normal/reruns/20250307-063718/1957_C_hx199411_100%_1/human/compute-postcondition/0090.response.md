Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input`**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new input is read and split into two integers, which are assigned to `c` and `r`.
