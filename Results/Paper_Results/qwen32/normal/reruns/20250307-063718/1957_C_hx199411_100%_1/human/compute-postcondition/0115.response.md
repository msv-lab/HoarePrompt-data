Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` is in the range `[n - 2k, n - k]` and `m` is not 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the element at index 1 of the list `dp` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
