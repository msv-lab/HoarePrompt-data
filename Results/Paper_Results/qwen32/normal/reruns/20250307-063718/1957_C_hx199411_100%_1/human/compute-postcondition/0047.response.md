The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those to ensure the loop can execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, `num`, and `m` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num` which is `n`, and if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 0**
