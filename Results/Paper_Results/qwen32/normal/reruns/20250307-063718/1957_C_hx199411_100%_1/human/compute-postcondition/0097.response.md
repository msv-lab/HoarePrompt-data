The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. This means the previous values of `c` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input, `num` is 1 and `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1.**
