The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state, if `c` equals `r`, `num` was 2, and it becomes 4. If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was either 3 or 4, and it becomes either 5 or 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the new input, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 2, and `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is either 5 or 6.**
