The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `dp`, `i`) except for updating the values of `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` in the if part, otherwise `num` is 3 in the else part, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 2` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 3`), if `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
