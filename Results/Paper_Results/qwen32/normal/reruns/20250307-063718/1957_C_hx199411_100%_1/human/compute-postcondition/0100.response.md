Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1, and `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4.**
