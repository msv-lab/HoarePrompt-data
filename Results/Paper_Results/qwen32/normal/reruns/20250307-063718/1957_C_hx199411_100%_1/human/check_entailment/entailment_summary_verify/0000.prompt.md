You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
def func():

    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:

            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the moves made, where each move is represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The result is printed for each test case, which is either `1` if the remaining cells to be filled are `0` or `1`, or a value computed using a dynamic programming approach if there are more cells to be filled.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly account for all possible final configurations of the chessboard. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Counting Moves**: The program correctly counts the number of moves (`num`) that have already been made and their implications on the board. It increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), and by 2 otherwise.

2. **Remaining Slots (`m`)**: The program calculates the remaining slots (`m`) on the board where rooks can be placed. This is done by subtracting `num` from `n`.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining slots. The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill in the DP table up to `dp[m]`.

However, the transition formula and the base cases do not accurately represent the problem's requirements for counting the configurations of rooks on the board. Specifically:

- **Base Case for `dp[2]`**: The base case `dp[2] = 3` is incorrect. When there are 2 remaining slots, the possible configurations are:
  - Place a white rook in the first slot and a black rook in the second.
  - Place a black rook in the first slot and a white rook in the second.
  - Place a white rook in the first slot and a white rook in the second (and similarly for black rooks).
  This results in 4 configurations, not 3.

- **Transition Formula**: The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly account for the placement of rooks. The factor of 2 in the formula seems to be incorrect and does not accurately represent the choices available for placing rooks.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider a 4x4 board with 1 move already made at (1, 2). The correct number of configurations should be 3, as described in the problem statement. However, the program calculates the number of configurations incorrectly due to the flawed DP formula and base cases.

To fix the program, the base cases and transition formula should be revised to accurately reflect the problem's requirements for counting the configurations of rooks on the board.
