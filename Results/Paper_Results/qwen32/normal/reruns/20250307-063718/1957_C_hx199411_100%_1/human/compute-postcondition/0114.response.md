The code snippet initializes the list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `m + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and the condition for `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` is in the range `[n - 2k, n - k]` and `m` is not 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`.**
