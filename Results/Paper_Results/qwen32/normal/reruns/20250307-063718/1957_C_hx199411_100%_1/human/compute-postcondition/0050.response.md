Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1, `m` is `n - num` which is `n - 1`, and if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input, `r` is the second integer read from the input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

In this output state, `num` has been incremented by 1, making its value 1. Consequently, `m` is recalculated as `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
