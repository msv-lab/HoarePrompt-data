The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` was initially 0. After the increment, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num` which is `n - 2`, and if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input, `r` is the second integer read from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.
