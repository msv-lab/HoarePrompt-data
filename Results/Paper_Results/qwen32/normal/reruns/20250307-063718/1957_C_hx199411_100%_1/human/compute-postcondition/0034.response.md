The given code snippet updates the value of the `dp` list at index `i` based on the values at indices `i-1` and `i-2`. The specific calculation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

The initial state specifies that `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3. The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is an index for the `dp` list that is being updated.

Given the code snippet, the value of `dp[i]` will change based on the calculation, while other elements of `dp` and other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
