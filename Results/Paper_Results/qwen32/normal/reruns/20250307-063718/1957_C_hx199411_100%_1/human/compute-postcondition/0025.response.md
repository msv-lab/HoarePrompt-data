Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is the first integer read from the input, and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
3. `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `k` must be greater than 0.
4. `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
5. `m` is `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. The code simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
