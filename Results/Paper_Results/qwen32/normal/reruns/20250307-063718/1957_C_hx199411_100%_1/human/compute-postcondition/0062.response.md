The code snippet provided increments the value of `num` by 2. Therefore, if `num` was 2, it will now be 4, and if `num` was 3, it will now be 5.

The value of `m` is calculated based on the original value of `num` (before the increment), so `m` remains unchanged by this operation. The value of `m` is `n - num` (which was `n - 2` or `n - 3`), and this does not change with the increment of `num`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `c`, and `r` are not affected by the increment of `num`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r` initially, otherwise `num` is 5, `m` is `n - 2` if `c` equals `r` initially, otherwise `m` is `n - 3`, if `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
