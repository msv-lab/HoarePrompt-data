The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the range `3` to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning `m + 1` must be greater than `3`. This implies that `m` must be at least `2`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`
- `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.

To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be at least `2` so that `m + 1` is at least `3` and the range `3` to `m + 1` is valid.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least `2`. Since `m` is defined as `n - num`, we need to ensure that `n - num` is at least `2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
