Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the first integer read from the new input, `r` is the second integer read from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 2`.**
