The given code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state provides some information about the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp`, but it does not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement. The `print(1)` statement will simply output the integer 1, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `dp`).
2. The value to be printed is explicitly `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
