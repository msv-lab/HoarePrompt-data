The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 1` if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `n - 2`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer read from the input, and `r` is the second integer read from the input.**
