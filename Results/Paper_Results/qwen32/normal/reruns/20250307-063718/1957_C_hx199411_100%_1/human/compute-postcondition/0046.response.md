Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num` which is `n`, and if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.**

In simple terms, the variable `num` has been reset to 0, and `m` has been recalculated as `n` since `num` is now 0. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
