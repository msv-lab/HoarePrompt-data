Given the initial state and the specific case where `m = 7`, we know the values of the `dp` list are explicitly provided as `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 265, 889]`. The `dp` list is of length `m + 1`, and we are asked to print `dp[m]`.

Since `m = 7`, we need to print `dp[7]`. According to the provided `dp` list, `dp[7]` is `889`.

Thus, the code will print the value `889`.

Output: **889**
