The code snippet provided increments the variable `num` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `num` will be increased by 1 from its previous value, while the rest of the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input after `n` and `k`, `i` is incremented by 1, `num` is incremented by 1.**
