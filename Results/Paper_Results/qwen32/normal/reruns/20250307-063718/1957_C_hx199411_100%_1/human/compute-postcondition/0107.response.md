The value of `m` is updated to `n - num`. Given that `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` will be in the range `[n - 2k, n - k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` is in the range `[n - 2k, n - k]`, `dp` is unchanged unless `m` is 0, 1, or 8.**
