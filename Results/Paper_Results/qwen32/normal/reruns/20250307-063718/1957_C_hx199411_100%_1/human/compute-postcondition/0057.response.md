The code snippet provided is `num += 2`. This increments the value of `num` by 2. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2.
- `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 1` if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `n - 2`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.

After the code `num += 2` is executed:
- If `num` was initially 1 (when `c` equals `r`), `num` becomes 3.
- If `num` was initially 2 (when `c` does not equal `r`), `num` becomes 4.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 3` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 4`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
