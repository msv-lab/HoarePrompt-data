Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks. The computer mirrors your moves unless you place a rook on the diagonal, in which case the computer skips its turn. The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations of the board after all valid moves are made.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Moves**: You and the computer have already made \( k \) moves each (except when you place a rook on the diagonal, the computer skips its turn).
2. **Remaining Moves**: After \( k \) moves, we need to determine how many ways we can place the remaining rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
3. **Mirroring**: The computer mirrors your moves unless you place a rook on the diagonal.
4. **Configuration Counting**: We need to count the number of valid configurations of the board after all moves, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis

The program attempts to solve the problem by:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the board \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
2. **Counting Moves**: It counts the number of moves that are on the diagonal and those that are not.
3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: It calculates the number of remaining positions \( m \) on the board where rooks can be placed.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This relation is based on the idea that for each new rook, we can either place it in a new row/column (which gives \( dp[i-1] \) ways) or we can place it in a way that involves mirroring (which gives \( (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2 \) ways).

### Correctness Check

The program's approach seems to be based on the correct understanding of the problem and the constraints. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Base Cases**: The program correctly handles the base cases where \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \).
2. **Dynamic Programming Relation**: The recurrence relation used seems to be correct for counting the number of valid configurations.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure the result does not overflow.

### Conclusion

The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input reading, the counting of moves, and the dynamic programming calculation correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
