The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 3 to `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down step by step:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value, let's say `i = x`.
- For the next iteration, `i` must be `x + 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m + 1`.

Given that the loop is currently processing `i` and it will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration, we adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the next state as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. If we denote the previous value of `i` as `x`, then the next value of `i` will be `x + 1`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` such that `n - num` is at least 2, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**.

This state assumes that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` had a different value, `i` would be that value plus 1.
