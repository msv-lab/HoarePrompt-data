The code snippet provided only contains the line `t -= 1`. This line decrements the value of `t` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `t` must be greater than 0. After executing `t -= 1`, `t` will be one less than its initial value, but it will still be greater than 0 (as per the precondition).

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.**
