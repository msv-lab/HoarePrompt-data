The `while` loop in the provided code is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is not zero. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `t` is still greater than zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, and `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain the same.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation**.
