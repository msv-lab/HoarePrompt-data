Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 3` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 4`). If `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts of the program fragment.
