Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` equals 1, the current value of `m` is 1. Otherwise, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain the same, `m` is `n - num` and is not equal to 0 or 1, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.**
