To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description and the provided example outputs.

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the moves.

2. **Counting Moves:**
   - For each move `(c, r)`, it checks if `c == r`.
     - If true, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
     - If false, it increments `num` by 2 (your move and the computer's mirrored move).
   - This effectively counts the number of positions that are already occupied or will be occupied due to the initial moves.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of empty positions left on the board after the initial `k` moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration (either no more moves or exactly one move left).
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
     - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` positions.
       - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for placing a rook in one position and leaving the rest.
       - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for placing a rook in one position and its mirrored position, and then configuring the remaining `i - 2` positions.
     - The factor of 2 accounts for the two possible colors (white and black) for the first rook placed.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible configurations for each test case modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 1`, move `(1, 2)`
  - `num = 2` (your move `(1, 2)` and computer's move `(2, 1)`)
  - `m = 4 - 2 = 2`
  - `dp[2] = 3` (from the recurrence relation)
  - Output: `3`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `n = 8`, `k = 1`, move `(7, 6)`
  - `num = 2` (your move `(7, 6)` and computer's move `(6, 7)`)
  - `m = 8 - 2 = 6`
  - `dp[6] = 331` (calculated using the recurrence relation)
  - Output: `331`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `n = 1000`, `k = 4`, moves `(4, 4)`, `(952, 343)`, `(222, 333)`, `(90, 91)`
  - `num = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9` (your move `(4, 4)` and no computer move, your moves `(952, 343)` and `(222, 333)` and their mirrored moves, your move `(90, 91)` and its mirrored move)
  - `m = 1000 - 9 = 991`
  - `dp[991] = 671968183` (calculated using the recurrence relation)
  - Output: `671968183`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations for each test case. It handles the dynamic programming aspect correctly and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
