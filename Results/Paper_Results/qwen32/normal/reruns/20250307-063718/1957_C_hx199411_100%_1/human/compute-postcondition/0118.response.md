Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`, `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is 3`**

In simpler terms, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated to `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which simplifies to `7`. All other variables remain unchanged.
