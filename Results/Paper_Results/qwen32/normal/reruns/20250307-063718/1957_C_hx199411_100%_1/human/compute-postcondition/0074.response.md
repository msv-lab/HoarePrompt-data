The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the value at index 2 of the list `dp` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c == r` or not across all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
