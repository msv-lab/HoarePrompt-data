Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, and `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain the same.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c == r` or not across all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made to `dp`. If `m` is 1, `dp` is a list of length 2 with `dp[1]` as 1. If `m` is 8, `dp` is a list of length 9 with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, `dp[3]` as 7, `dp[4]` as 25, `dp[5]` as 81, `dp[6]` as 331, `dp[7]` as 1303, and `dp[8]` as 5937.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 2` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is in the range `[k, 2k]`. If `m` is 0, `dp` is unchanged unless `m` is 0, 1, or 8. If `m` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged unless `m` is 8. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 331, `dp[7]` which is 1303, `dp[8]` which is 5937, `dp[9]` which is 26785, `dp[10]` which is 133651, and `i` is `m + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
