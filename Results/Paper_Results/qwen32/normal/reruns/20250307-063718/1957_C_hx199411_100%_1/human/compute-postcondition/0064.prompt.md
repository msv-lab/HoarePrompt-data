Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num` which is `n`, and if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 1` if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `n - 2`), and if `m` is 0, its value remains 0. If `m` is 1, its value remains 1. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer read from the input, and `r` is the second integer read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` in the if part, otherwise `num` is 3 in the else part, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 2` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 3`), and if `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 1, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 3` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 4`). If `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
