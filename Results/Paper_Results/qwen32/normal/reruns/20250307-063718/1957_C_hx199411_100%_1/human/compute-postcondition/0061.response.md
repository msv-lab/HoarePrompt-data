The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` in the if part, otherwise `num` is 3 in the else part.
- `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 2` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 3`).
- If `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same.
- If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation.
- `i` is 2.
- `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.

After executing `num += 1`:
- If `num` was 2, it becomes 3.
- If `num` was 3, it becomes 4.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3 or 4, `m` is `n - num` (which is `n - 3` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 4`), if `m` is 0 or 1, its value remains the same, if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with values calculated by the recurrence relation, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input.**
