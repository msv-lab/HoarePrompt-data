Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the moves made, where each move is represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The result is printed for each test case, which is either `1` if the remaining cells to be filled are `0` or `1`, or a value computed using a dynamic programming approach if there are more cells to be filled.**
