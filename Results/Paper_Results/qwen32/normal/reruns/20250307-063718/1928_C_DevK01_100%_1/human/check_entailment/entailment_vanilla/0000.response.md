To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it correctly solves the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints:
1. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
2. Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are given.
3. We need to find all \( k \) such that the settling pattern assigns the number \( x \) to position \( n \).

The settling pattern alternates between an increasing sequence from 1 to \( k \) and a decreasing sequence from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats.

### Solution Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the values \( n \) and \( x \) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable \( y \) is calculated as \( n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, the function immediately prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because the pattern \( 2k - 2 \) must be even, so \( n + x \) must be even.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \). This function finds all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), the function `func_1` is called again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \). This is to account for the second part of the pattern (decreasing sequence).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) to ensure all divisors are found.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the logic correctly finds all possible \( k \) values:

- **Pattern Analysis:**
  - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
  - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that \( n \) maps to \( x \) in the pattern.
  
- **Divisor Check:**
  - The code correctly identifies the conditions under which \( k \) can be a valid solution.
  - It uses the property that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) must match the position of \( x \) within one cycle of the pattern.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the case where \( n + x \) is odd by immediately returning 0.
  - It correctly accounts for both increasing and decreasing parts of the pattern.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds all possible \( k \) values by leveraging the properties of divisors and the repeating pattern.

Correctness: **True**
