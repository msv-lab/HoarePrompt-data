The code provided only initializes the variable `i` to 1. None of the other variables (`q`, `w`, `M`) are affected by this statement. Therefore, the values of `q`, `w`, and `M` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.**
