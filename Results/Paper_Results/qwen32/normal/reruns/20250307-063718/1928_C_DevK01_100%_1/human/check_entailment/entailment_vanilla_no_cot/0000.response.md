To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately solves the problem as described.

The problem requires finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that, given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \), the described settling pattern is consistent.

Let's break down the key parts of the program and the logic it implements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (Vasya's position) and \( x \) (the number Vasya received).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program first checks if \( y = n + x \) is even. If not, it prints 0 because \( k \) must be such that the pattern fits, and an odd \( y \) would imply an inconsistency.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calculates another \( q = (n - x) // 2 \) and calls `func_1(q, x)` again, adding the results to the list of possible \( k \) values.
   - It then removes duplicates from the list of possible \( k \) values and prints the length of this list.

3. **Helper Function (`func_1`):**
   - This function finds divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), adding it to the list of possible \( k \) values.
   - It then iterates through numbers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \( q \), checking if each number and its corresponding quotient (if greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \)) are divisors of \( q \).

### Analysis:

The main issue with the program is the incorrect logic for determining the possible values of \( k \). Here are a few points to consider:

- **Pattern Analysis:**
  - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
  - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must be such that the \( n \)-th position in the repeating pattern corresponds to \( x \).

- **Possible \( k \) Values:**
  - The program attempts to find divisors of certain expressions involving \( n \) and \( x \) to determine possible \( k \) values.
  - However, the conditions and expressions used do not directly correspond to the actual pattern described in the problem.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where \( y \) is odd correctly by printing 0.
  - However, the logic for finding possible \( k \) values when \( y \) is even is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for determining the possible values of \( k \) is incorrect. It does not accurately reflect the pattern described in the problem and fails to correctly count the number of valid \( k \) values for given \( n \) and \( x \).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
