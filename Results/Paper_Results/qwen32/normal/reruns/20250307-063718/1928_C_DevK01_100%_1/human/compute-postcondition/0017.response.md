The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 2, the list `M` will have 2 appended to it. The other variables, `q`, `w`, and `i`, remain unchanged in terms of their described properties.

Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 2, `M` has 2 appended to it.**
