Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding all possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position and number fit the described "first-k-th" settling pattern. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` (Vasya's position in the line) and `x` (the number Vasya received during the settling).

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - It checks if `n + x` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the pattern can only fit if `n + x` is even. This is because the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and for a valid `k`, `n + x` must fit into this pattern in a way that respects the symmetry.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - It calculates `y = (n + x - 2) // 2` and calls `func_1(y, x)` to find all divisors of `y` that are at least `x - 1`. These divisors represent potential values of `k - 1` or `k - 2` in the pattern.
   - If `n` is large enough (specifically, `n >= 3 * x - 2`), it calculates another potential set of divisors by calling `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`. This accounts for the pattern repeating and Vasya's position fitting into the second part of the pattern.

4. **Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique `k` values found.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `q` that are at least `x - 1`. It considers both `i` and `q // i` as potential divisors and ensures they are not less than `x - 1`.

**Correctness**:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when `n + x` is odd and when `n` is large enough to require additional calculations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies all potential `k` values by finding divisors of the appropriate numbers.

However, there is a discrepancy in the execution summary. The summary suggests that `func_1` accepts a list of tuples, but in the code, `func_1` is called with a single integer and an integer, not a list of tuples. This discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the program as it stands, but it indicates a mismatch between the code and the summary.

Given the provided code and the problem statement, the program seems to be correctly implementing the solution.

Correctness: **True**
