The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 3, `M` will have 3 appended to it. The other variables (`q`, `w`) and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` has 3 appended to it.**
