The `while` loop condition is `i < w`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than `w`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `w` must be greater than 2

Since `w` must be greater than 2 and `i` is 3, we need to adjust `w` to be greater than 3 to ensure that `i < w` holds true for another iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the `while` loop condition.

State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 3, and `w` must be greater than 3**
