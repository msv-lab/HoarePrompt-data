Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors `i` and `n // i` of `n` such that `i` and `n // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `i` ranges from 1 to `n - 1`.**
