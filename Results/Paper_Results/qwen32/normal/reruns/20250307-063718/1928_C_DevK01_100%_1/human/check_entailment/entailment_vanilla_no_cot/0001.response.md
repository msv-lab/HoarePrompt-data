To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` are valid according to the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Key Observations
1. **Pattern Repetition**: The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Position Calculation**: For a given `k`, Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received must fit within the pattern.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1`, `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot match.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with parameters `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to find possible values of `k`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with parameters `(n - x) // 2` and `x` and adds the results.
   - It removes duplicates from the list of possible `k` values and prints the count.
3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds divisors of `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and if so, adds it to the list of possible `k` values.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `q` to find divisors and adds them to the list if they meet the criteria.

### Correctness Verification
The program seems to correctly implement the logic to find all possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints. It handles the repetition pattern and checks the conditions for valid `k` values. The use of divisors and the checks for the pattern's validity ensure that the results are accurate.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
