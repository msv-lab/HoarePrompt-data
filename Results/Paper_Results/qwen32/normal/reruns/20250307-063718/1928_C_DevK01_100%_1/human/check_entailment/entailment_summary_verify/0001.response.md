### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of natural numbers \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) in the line corresponds to the number \( x \) in the settling pattern. The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions increasing from 1 to \( k \) and the next \( k-2 \) positions decreasing from \( k-1 \) to 2.

#### Solution Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the values \( n \) and \( x \) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable \( y \) is calculated as \( n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, the function immediately prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because the pattern \( 2k - 2 \) must be even, so \( n + x \) must be even.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \). This function finds all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), the function `func_1` is called again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \). This is to account for the second part of the pattern (decreasing sequence).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) to ensure all divisors are found.

#### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the logic correctly finds all possible \( k \) values:

- **Pattern Analysis:**
  - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
  - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that \( n \) maps to \( x \) in the pattern.

- **Divisor Check:**
  - The code correctly identifies the conditions under which \( k \) can be a valid solution.
  - It uses the property that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) must match the position of \( x \) within one cycle of the pattern.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the case where \( n + x \) is odd by immediately returning 0.
  - It correctly accounts for both increasing and decreasing parts of the pattern.

#### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary provided is not entirely accurate. The function `func_1` does not take a list of tuples as input. Instead, it takes two integers \( q \) and \( x \) and returns a list of divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

#### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds all possible \( k \) values by leveraging the properties of divisors and the repeating pattern. The function summary, however, is incorrect in its description of the input parameters for `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct, and the original assessment is accurate despite the inaccuracy in the function summary.
