### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position and number match the described pattern.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) (Vasya's position) and \( x \) (Vasya's number).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It computes \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because the pattern described in the problem requires \( y \) to be even.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \).
   - It calls `func_1(q, x)` to find all divisors of \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calculates another \( q = \frac{n - x}{2} \) and appends divisors of this new \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - It removes duplicates from the list of divisors and prints the count.

4. **Function `func_1(q, x)`:**
   - It finds all divisors of \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks for perfect squares and ensures that the square root is a valid divisor.
   - It iterates over possible divisors up to the square root of \( q \) and adds both the divisor and its complement to the list if they meet the criteria.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program correctly computes the necessary \( q \) values based on the problem constraints.
  - It efficiently finds all divisors of \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
  - The removal of duplicates ensures that each \( k \) is counted only once.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by immediately returning 0.
  - It also handles the condition \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case based on the provided problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
