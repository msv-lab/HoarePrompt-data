You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors `i` and `n // i` of `n` such that `i` and `n // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `i` ranges from 1 to `sqrt(n) - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it correctly solves the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints:
1. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
2. Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are given.
3. We need to find all \( k \) such that the settling pattern assigns the number \( x \) to position \( n \).

The settling pattern alternates between an increasing sequence from 1 to \( k \) and a decreasing sequence from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats.

### Solution Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the values \( n \) and \( x \) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable \( y \) is calculated as \( n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, the function immediately prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because the pattern \( 2k - 2 \) must be even, so \( n + x \) must be even.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \). This function finds all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), the function `func_1` is called again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \). This is to account for the second part of the pattern (decreasing sequence).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) to ensure all divisors are found.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the logic correctly finds all possible \( k \) values:

- **Pattern Analysis:**
  - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
  - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that \( n \) maps to \( x \) in the pattern.
  
- **Divisor Check:**
  - The code correctly identifies the conditions under which \( k \) can be a valid solution.
  - It uses the property that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) must match the position of \( x \) within one cycle of the pattern.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the case where \( n + x \) is odd by immediately returning 0.
  - It correctly accounts for both increasing and decreasing parts of the pattern.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds all possible \( k \) values by leveraging the properties of divisors and the repeating pattern.
