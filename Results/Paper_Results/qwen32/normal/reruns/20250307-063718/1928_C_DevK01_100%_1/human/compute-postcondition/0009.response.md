The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 1, the list `M` will have `1` appended to it. The other variables (`q`, `n`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `M` contains the value `[1]`.**
