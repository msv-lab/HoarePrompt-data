The code snippet increments the variable `i` by 1. The other variables (`q`, `w`, `M`, `n`, `x`) are not directly modified by this statement. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `i`.

Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 4, and `w` must be greater than 3. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` has an additional element which is the result of `q // 3` appended to it. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
