Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then `M` contains the value `[1, q // i]` if `q // i >= x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
