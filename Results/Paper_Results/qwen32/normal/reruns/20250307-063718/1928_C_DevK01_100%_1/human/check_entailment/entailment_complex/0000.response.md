### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the number of valid `k` values for which the given position `n` and number `x` can fit according to the described "settling" pattern. The pattern alternates between ascending and descending sequences of length `k` and `k-2`, respectively, repeating every `2k-2` positions.

#### Key Points:
1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - Within each segment of length `2k-2`, the first `k` positions are `1, 2, ..., k`, and the next `k-2` positions are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `k > 1` (since the pattern does not exist for `k = 1`).
   - `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

3. **Approach**:
   - For a given `x`, `k` must satisfy the condition that `x` appears at position `n` in the repeating pattern.
   - The position `n` can be mapped to a position within the first `2k-2` positions using modulo arithmetic.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a certain value that meet the criteria for `k`.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Main Loop**:
  - The main loop reads `t` test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
  - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot fit.
  - If `y` is even, it calculates `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` and finds their divisors using `func_1`.
  - It combines the results and prints the number of unique `k` values.

- **Function `func_1(q, x)`**:
  - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It uses a loop to check divisors up to the square root of `q`.

#### Issues and Corrections:
- **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation**:
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the description of the function in the comments suggests that `q` is a list of tuples, which is incorrect. `q` should be an integer.
  - The function correctly finds divisors but the context in which it is used needs to be verified.

- **Pattern Matching**:
  - The main logic seems correct in identifying potential `k` values by finding divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.
  - However, the condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` before adding the results from `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` needs to be verified. This condition is not explicitly explained in the problem statement and might be incorrect.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles the case where `y` is odd by printing `0`, which is correct.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `n < 3 * x - 2` by not adding the results from the second call to `func_1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code has some issues with the description of the function `func_1` and the condition `n >= 3 * x - 2`. However, the core logic of finding divisors and combining results seems correct. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code appears to be generally correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
