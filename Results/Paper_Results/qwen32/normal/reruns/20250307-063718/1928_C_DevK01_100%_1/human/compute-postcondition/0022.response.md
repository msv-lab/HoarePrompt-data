The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, the value of `i` changes from 2 to 3. The other variables `q`, `w`, and `M` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`q` must contain at least one tuple `(n, x)` where `x` is at least 2, `i` is 3, and `w` must be greater than 2. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1`, `M` has an additional element which is `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
