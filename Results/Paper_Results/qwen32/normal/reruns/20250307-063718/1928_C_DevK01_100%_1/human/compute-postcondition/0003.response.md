The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the integer `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `M` will contain one element, which is the integer `w`.

The initial state specifies that `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. This condition remains unchanged. Additionally, `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This condition also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
