You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' prints, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs a series of operations on the list and prints 'YES' if the final two elements of the modified list are zero and all previous elements were non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic**: The code incorrectly modifies the array elements. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` do not correctly implement the described operation. The operation should reduce `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the code does not achieve this correctly.

2. **Negative Values Handling**: The code checks for negative values in the array but does not handle them properly. The logic for checking and modifying the array elements is flawed and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero as per the operation rules.

3. **Final Check**: The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if all elements in the array can be zero. It should ensure that all elements are zero after applying the operations.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The code does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
