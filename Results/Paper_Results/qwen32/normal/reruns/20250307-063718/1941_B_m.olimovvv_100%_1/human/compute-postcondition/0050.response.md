Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `a` still holds a value of at least 3. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The element `b[i + 1]` has been updated to its previous value minus twice the value of `b[i]`. The element `b[i + 2]` has been updated to its previous value minus the value of `b[i]`.
