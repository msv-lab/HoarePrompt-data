Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, the loop prints 'YES' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `a`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is set to 0. The loop prints 'YES' and then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
