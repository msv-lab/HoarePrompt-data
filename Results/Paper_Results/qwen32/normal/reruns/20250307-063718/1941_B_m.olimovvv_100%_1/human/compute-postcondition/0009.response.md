The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. The other elements of `b` and the variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged. 

So, if `b[i + 2]` was initially `x`, it will now be `x - b[i]`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and other elements of `b` remain unchanged.**
