In the given task, the initial state provided is `i` is `i + 2`. This statement suggests that the variable `i` is being updated to its current value plus 2. However, this operation does not affect the `print` statement directly, as the `print` statement only outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state modifies the variable `i` by adding 2 to its current value: `i = i + 2`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which outputs the string `'NO'`.

The value of `i` after the operation does not influence what is printed by the `print` statement because the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
