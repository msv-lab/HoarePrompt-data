The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, and the elements of `b` that are not `b[i]` or `b[i + 1]` remain unchanged. The condition regarding breaking out of the loop if `b[i]` is less than 0 is not directly affected by this operation, but it still holds for the same elements of `b`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, and if `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
