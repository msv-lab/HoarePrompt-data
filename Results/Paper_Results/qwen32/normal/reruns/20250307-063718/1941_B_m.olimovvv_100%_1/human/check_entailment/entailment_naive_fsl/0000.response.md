Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic**: The code incorrectly modifies the array elements. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` do not correctly implement the described operation. The operation should reduce `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the code does not achieve this correctly.

2. **Negative Values Handling**: The code checks for negative values in the array but does not handle them properly. The logic for checking and modifying the array elements is flawed and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero as per the operation rules.

3. **Final Check**: The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if all elements in the array can be zero. It should ensure that all elements are zero after applying the operations.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The code does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
