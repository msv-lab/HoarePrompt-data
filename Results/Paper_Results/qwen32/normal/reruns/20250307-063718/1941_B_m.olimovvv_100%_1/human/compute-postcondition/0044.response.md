The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `a - 2`. We need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` remains the same and is at least 3.
- `b[i]` is 0, but this does not affect the loop head.
- `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain the same, but these also do not affect the loop head.

To determine if the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `a - 2`.

From the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again:
- `i + 1` must be less than `a - 2`.

State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it clear, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is `i + 1` and `i_new < a - 2`**

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`**
