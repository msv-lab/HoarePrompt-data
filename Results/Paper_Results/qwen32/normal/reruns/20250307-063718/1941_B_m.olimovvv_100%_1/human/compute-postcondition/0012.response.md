The given initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, and `i`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not use any of these variables. Instead, it prints the string `'NO'` directly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Variable `a`:** It is an integer greater than 2.
3. **Variable `i`:** It is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but this operation does not affect the print statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Since the print statement contains a literal string `'NO'`, it will output this string regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `i`.

Output: **NO**
