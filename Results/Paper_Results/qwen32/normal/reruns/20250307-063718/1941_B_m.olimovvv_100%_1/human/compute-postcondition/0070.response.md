The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'YES', and if `b[i]` were less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement would be broken out of, but since `b[i]` is now 0, this condition is not met.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, the loop prints 'YES'.**
