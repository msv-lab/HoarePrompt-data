The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `b[i]` is 0, so `b[i] * 2` is also 0. Therefore, subtracting 0 from `b[i + 1]` does not change the value of `b[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
