The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is contained within. The values of the variables are not altered by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except for `i` which was incremented by 1 before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
