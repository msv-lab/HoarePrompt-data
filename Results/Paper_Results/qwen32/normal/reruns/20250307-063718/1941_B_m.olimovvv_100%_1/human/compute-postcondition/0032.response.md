Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, and the current element `b[i]` is less than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged, but we exit the current loop or if statement.
