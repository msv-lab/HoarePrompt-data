The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, and the condition related to `b[i]` being less than 0 are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.**
