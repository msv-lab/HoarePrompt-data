The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in zero. The other elements of `b` remain unchanged as per the initial state description. The values of `t` and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and other elements of `b` remain unchanged.**
