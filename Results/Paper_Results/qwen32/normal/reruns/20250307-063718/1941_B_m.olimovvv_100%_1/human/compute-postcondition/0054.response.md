The code snippet `a = int(input())` changes the value of `a` to whatever integer value is provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `b`) and their conditions remain unchanged. The loop printing 'YES' is not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is the input integer, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is 0, `b[a-1]` is 0, and the loop prints 'YES'**.
