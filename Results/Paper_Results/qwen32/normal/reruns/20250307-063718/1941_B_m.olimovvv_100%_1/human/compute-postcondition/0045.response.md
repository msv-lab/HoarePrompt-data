The given initial state describes the conditions and values of certain variables before the code snippet is executed. However, the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `t`, `a`, or `i` in any way. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Here are the steps of reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, and `i`. It states that `t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, and `i` is `i + 1`. 
2. The print statement in the code snippet is `print('NO')`.
3. The string 'NO' is a literal and does not depend on any variable or condition in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
