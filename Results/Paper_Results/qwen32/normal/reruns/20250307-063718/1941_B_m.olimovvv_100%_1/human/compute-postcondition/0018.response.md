The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limits `0` and `a - 2`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue as long as `i` is in the range `[0, a - 2)`, meaning `i` must be less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a` is an integer greater than 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.

To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration). Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged**. 

However, since we are only concerned with the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to specify `i`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`**. 

But to be clear in the context of the loop condition, we should ensure `i + 2` is still within the range `[0, a - 2)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`**. 

Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` should be `i + 2` for the next iteration, and `i + 2` must be less than `a - 2` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`**. 

Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`**. 

Since we need to ensure `i + 2` is less than `a - 2` for the loop to continue, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`**. 

But to ensure clarity and correctness, we should specify the condition:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2` and `i + 2` is less than `a - 2`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`**.
