The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The precondition describes several variables and their states, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NO'`.
2. The variables `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i` are mentioned in the precondition, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.
3. The state of `i` being incremented by 1 does not affect the `print` statement since it is not used in the statement.

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables mentioned in the precondition, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
