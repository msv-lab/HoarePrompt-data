The code snippet provided modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `b[i]` is 0, so the value of `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, the loop prints 'YES'. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
