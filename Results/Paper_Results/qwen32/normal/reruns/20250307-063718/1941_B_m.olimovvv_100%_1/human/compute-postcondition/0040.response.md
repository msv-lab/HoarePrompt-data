Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement, considering both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the behavior when `b[i]` is not less than 0 is not specified, but the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the increment of `i`.
