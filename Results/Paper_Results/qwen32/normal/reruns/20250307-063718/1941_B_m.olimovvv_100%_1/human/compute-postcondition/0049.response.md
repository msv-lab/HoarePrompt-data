The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the expression for `b[i + 1]` also remains as `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`**.
