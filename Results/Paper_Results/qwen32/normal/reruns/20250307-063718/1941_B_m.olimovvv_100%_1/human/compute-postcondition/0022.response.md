The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The condition `if b[i] < 0` and the resulting break do not affect the execution of this line, as the break would only occur after this line if the condition were met.

Given the initial state, the only change is to `b[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is defined as `i + 2`, but this does not directly affect the current operation on `b[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`. If `b[i] < 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
