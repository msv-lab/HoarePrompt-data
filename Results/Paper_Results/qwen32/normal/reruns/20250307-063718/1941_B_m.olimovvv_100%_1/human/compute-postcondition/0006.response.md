Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers read from the input. The current element `b[i]` is less than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` do not change. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
