The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` sets the value of `b[i]` to 0. This change impacts the subsequent operations in the loop, specifically the updates to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]`. Since `b[i]` becomes 0, `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged (`b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2` simplifies to `b[i + 1] - 0 * 2` which is `b[i + 1]`), and `b[i + 2]` also remains unchanged (`b[i + 2] - b[i]` simplifies to `b[i + 2] - 0` which is `b[i + 2]`). The loop continues to print 'YES' unless `b[i]` is less than 0, but since `b[i]` is set to 0, this condition is not met.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, the loop prints 'YES'. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
