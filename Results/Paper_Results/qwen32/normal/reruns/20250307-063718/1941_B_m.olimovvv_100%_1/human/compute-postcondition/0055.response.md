The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. The initial state specifies that `b` was previously a list with specific values, but since the input operation overwrites `b`, those initial values are no longer relevant.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is the input integer, `b` is a list of integers as read from the input, and the loop prints 'YES'.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `t` retains its original value, `a` retains its original value which is an input integer, and `b` is now a list of integers that were provided as input. The loop that prints 'YES' is unaffected by this operation.
