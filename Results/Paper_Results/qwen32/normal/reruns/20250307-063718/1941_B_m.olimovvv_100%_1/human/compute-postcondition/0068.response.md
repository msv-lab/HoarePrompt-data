The given code snippet modifies the value of `b[i + 1]`. Specifically, it subtracts twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. Given that `b[i]` is initially 0, the operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` effectively does not change the value of `b[i + 1]` because `0 * 2` is `0`.

Therefore, the value of `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged. The other variables and conditions provided in the initial state remain valid as well.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same, the loop prints 'YES'. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
