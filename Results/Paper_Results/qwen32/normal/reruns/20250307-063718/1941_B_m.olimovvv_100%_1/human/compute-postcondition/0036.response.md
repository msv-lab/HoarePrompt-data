The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in 0. This change impacts the subsequent updates to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` as described in the initial state.

Since `b[i]` becomes 0, the updates to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` simplify as follows:
- `b[i + 1]` becomes `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]` which simplifies to `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0` or simply `b[i + 1]`.
- `b[i + 2]` becomes `b[i + 2] - b[i]` which simplifies to `b[i + 2] - 0` or simply `b[i + 2]`.

The condition `if b[i] < 0` is no longer relevant because `b[i]` is now 0, which is not less than 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` remains the same, `b[i + 2]` remains the same.**
