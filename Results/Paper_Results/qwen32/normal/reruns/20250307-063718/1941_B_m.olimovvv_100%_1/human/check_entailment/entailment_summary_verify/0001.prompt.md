You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs a series of operations on the list and prints 'YES' if the final two elements of the modified list are zero and all previous elements were non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the described operation to make all elements zero. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Operation**: The program incorrectly applies the operation starting from index 0 and goes up to `a - 2`. The problem specifies that the operation can only be applied at indices `i` where `2 <= i <= n - 1`. This means the operation should be applied starting from index 1 (second element) to `n - 2` (second-to-last element).

2. **Incorrect Update of Array Elements**: The program incorrectly updates the array elements. Specifically, it tries to update `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i] * 2` and `b[i]` respectively, and then sets `b[i]` to 0. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem. The operation should reduce `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1, not the way it's implemented here.

3. **Negative Values**: The program checks if any element becomes negative after the operation, but this check is not sufficient to determine if the operation can be applied correctly or not. The logic for applying the operation and checking for feasibility needs to be re-evaluated.

4. **Final Check**: The program checks if the last two elements are zero after the loop. However, this check is not comprehensive enough to determine if the entire array can be made zero. The logic for ensuring all elements can be made zero is flawed.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
