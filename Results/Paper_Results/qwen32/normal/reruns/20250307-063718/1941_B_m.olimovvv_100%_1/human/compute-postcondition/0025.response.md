To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (inclusive). This means the loop will run `a - 2` times if no `break` statement is encountered.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - If `b[i] < 0`, it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - Otherwise, it modifies the list `b` as follows:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which sets `b[i]` to 0)

### Key Observations:
- The loop modifies `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]` in each iteration.
- The loop will run `a - 2` times unless a `break` condition is met.
- After all iterations, the loop checks if `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0. If not, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used in the loop condition.
- **`b`**: The values of `b` will be modified based on the loop operations. Specifically:
  - `b[i]` will be 0 after each iteration where `b[i]` was non-negative.
  - `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` will be adjusted based on the values of `b[i]` before modification.
- **Loop Completion**: The loop will complete all `a - 2` iterations unless a `break` condition is met (i.e., `b[i] < 0` for some `i`).

### Output State:
- After all iterations, the list `b` should have its first `a - 2` elements set to 0.
- The final two elements (`b[-2]` and `b[-1]`) must both be 0 for the program to print 'YES'.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` has its first `a - 2` elements set to 0, and the last two elements (`b[-2]` and `b[-1]`) are 0. The program prints 'YES' if `b[-1] == 0` and `b[-2] == 0`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `b` should have its first `a - 2` elements as 0, and the last two elements should also be 0 for the program to print 'YES'. If any of these conditions are not met, the program will print 'NO'.
