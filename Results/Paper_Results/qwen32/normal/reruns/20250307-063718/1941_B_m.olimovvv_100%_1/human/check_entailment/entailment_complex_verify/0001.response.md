### Reasoning:
Let's evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Operation Details**: The operation can only be applied at indices \(i\) where \(2 \le i \le n - 1\). This means the operation modifies the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\).
2. **Operation Effect**: The operation reduces \(a_{i-1}\) by 1, \(a_i\) by 2, and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Indexing**: The program iterates from `0` to `a - 2`, which is incorrect. It should iterate from `1` to `a - 2` to match the problem's requirement.
2. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The program updates `b[i + 1]` by subtracting `b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]`, which does not align with the problem's operation.
3. **Negative Values Check**: The program checks for negative values after each operation, but this check alone is not sufficient to ensure the feasibility of the operations.
4. **Final Check**: The program only checks if the last two elements are zero, which is insufficient to confirm that the entire array can be made zero.

#### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly identify issues with the indexing and the logic for updating array elements.
- The annotations also point out that the final check is not comprehensive enough.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for applying the operations and checking the feasibility is flawed.

### Final Assessment:
**Final: False**

The provided program is incorrect based on the analysis and the annotated version of the code.
