The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, or `i`. It only terminates the innermost loop or switch construct that it is contained within. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
