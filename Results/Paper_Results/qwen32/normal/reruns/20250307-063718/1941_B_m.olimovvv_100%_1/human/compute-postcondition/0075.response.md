The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to account for this increment when considering the indices of `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` must be at least `i + 3`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `b[i] < 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of

After the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1`. The code then modifies `b[i + 1]` to be `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` must be at least `i + 4` (since `i` was incremented by 1 in the initial state and then used in the condition `a >= i + 3`)
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`
- If `b[i] < 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of

Output State: **`a` must be at least `i + 4`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, and if `b[i] < 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
