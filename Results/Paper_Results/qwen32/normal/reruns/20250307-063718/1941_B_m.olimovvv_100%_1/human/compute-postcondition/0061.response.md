The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the element at index `i + 1` of the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i`. 

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers, and the loop prints 'YES'. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`. The loop prints 'YES'. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
