To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3`, and within the loop, it performs the following operations:
- Checks if `b[i]` is less than 0. If true, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it updates `b[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * b[i]`.
- It updates `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]`.
- It sets `b[i]` to 0.

The loop continues until it either breaks out due to a negative value in `b[i]` or completes all iterations. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of `b` (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both 0. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `b[i]` becomes 0, and `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged.
- After 2 iterations: `b[i]` again becomes 0, and `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged.
- After 3 iterations: `b[i]` becomes 0, and `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged.

From this, we can infer that the loop continues to set `b[i]` to 0 and does not modify `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` after each iteration. This implies that the values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are not affected by the previous iterations in a way that would cause the loop to break (i.e., they remain non-negative).

After the loop completes, the final check is whether `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0. If they are, the loop prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the pattern of the loop, the final output state will depend on the values of the last two elements of `b` after the loop completes. Since the loop only sets `b[i]` to 0 and does not modify `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` in a way that would cause them to become negative, the final state of `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` will determine the output.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

Output State: **t remains the same, a is the input integer, b[-1] and b[-2] are checked, and the loop prints 'YES' if both are 0, otherwise 'NO'.**

In simple terms, the final output will be 'YES' if the last two elements of `b` are both 0 after the loop completes, and 'NO' otherwise.
