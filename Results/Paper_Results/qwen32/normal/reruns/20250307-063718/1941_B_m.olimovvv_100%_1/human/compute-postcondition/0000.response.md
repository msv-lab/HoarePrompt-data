In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop will execute `t` times, the only variable in the loop head that we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The variable `t` is already given in the state as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
3. The loop head does not involve any other variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute, no further adjustments are needed for `t`. The variable `_` in the loop head is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute as long as `t` is within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
