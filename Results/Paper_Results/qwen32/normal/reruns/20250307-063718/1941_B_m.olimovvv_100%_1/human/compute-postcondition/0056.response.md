The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `a`, and the range parameters `0` and `a - 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust `a` to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if the range is valid, meaning `a - 2` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This implies that `a` must be at least `2`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` remains the same, `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers as read from the input, and the loop prints 'YES'**.
