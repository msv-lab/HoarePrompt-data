The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged unless the loop or if statement is broken out of due to a negative element in `b`.

Given the initial state, if `b[i]` is not negative, the value of `b[i + 1]` will be updated. The values of `t` and `a` will remain the same as they were initially. The condition regarding the negative element in `b` does not affect the execution of this specific line unless it is triggered in a broader context not shown here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`, and other elements of `b` remain unchanged.**
