The given initial state describes a condition that `a` must be at least `i + 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `a` and `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The condition `a` must be at least `i + 3` is a constraint on the variables `a` and `i`. However, it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
2. The statement `i` is incremented by 1 modifies the value of `i`, but again, it does not affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print('NO')` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Given the above points, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a` or `i`.

Output: **NO**
