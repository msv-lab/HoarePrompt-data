The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `b` with integer values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
