The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets the value of `b[i]` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged unless `b[i]` was initially less than 0, which would have caused a break before this line was executed. Since the problem statement does not indicate that the break condition was met, we assume that the line was executed, and `b[i]` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`. If `b[i] < 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`. `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. `b[i]` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `b[i]` is now 0. The conditions and the values of `i`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]` remain as specified in the initial state.
