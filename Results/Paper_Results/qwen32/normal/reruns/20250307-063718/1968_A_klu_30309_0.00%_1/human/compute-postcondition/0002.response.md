The only variables in the loop head are `y` and the range parameters `x - 1`, `1`, and `-1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range parameters. Specifically, the loop will execute if the starting value (`x - 1`) is greater than the stopping value (`1`).

Given that `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 1000`, the starting value of the range (`x - 1`) will always be greater than `1`. Therefore, the loop can execute with the provided range parameters. However, the variable `y` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because it will be initialized by the `range` function during the first iteration.

The variable `max_val` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since it is part of the initial state, we should include it in the final state description.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1**
