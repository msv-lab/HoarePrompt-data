You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
        
    #State: `max_val` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.
    return max_val
    #The program returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns a value `y` based on the following conditions:
#- Case_1: If `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `y`, where `y` is a divisor of `x`.
#- Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met, it returns `y - 1`.
#- Case_3: If the condition in Case_2 is not met, it returns `y` which is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
#- Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `y`, which is a divisor of `x` such that `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`

Case_2: The program returns `y - 1`

Case_3: The program returns `y` which is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Case_4: The program returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
