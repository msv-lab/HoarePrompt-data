The value of `max_val` is updated to be equal to `y`. Other variables (`x` and the condition that `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is less than `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is `y`, `x` is divisible by `y`, and 2 * y is less than x.**
