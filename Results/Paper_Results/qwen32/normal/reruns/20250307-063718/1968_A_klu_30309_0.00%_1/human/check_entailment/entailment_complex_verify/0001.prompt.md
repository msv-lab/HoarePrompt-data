You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000 and returns the largest divisor `y` of `x` that satisfies `2 * y >= x`. If no such divisor exists, it returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find an integer `y` (where `1 <= y < x`) that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`.
2. If there are multiple such `y` values, any one of them is acceptable.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. The program reads `t` test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.
3. It then calls `func_1(x)` to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.
4. The function `func_1(x)` iterates over possible `y` values from `x-1` down to `2` (inclusive).
5. If `x % y == 0`, it means `y` is a divisor of `x`.
6. If `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y`. This is based on the observation that if `y` is a divisor of `x` and `y` is large enough such that `2 * y >= x`, then `gcd(x, y) = y` and `gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y`, which is a large value.
7. If no such `y` is found in the loop, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` found so far.

### Evaluation:
1. **Divisor Check**: The program correctly checks if `y` is a divisor of `x` by using the condition `x % y == 0`.
2. **Maximization Logic**: The logic `2 * y >= x` ensures that when `y` is a divisor and large enough, `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized because `gcd(x, y) = y` in this case.
3. **Efficiency**: The loop runs from `x-1` down to `2`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`x <= 1000`).

### Testing with Example Input:
Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

- For `x = 10`, the divisors are `1, 2, 5, 10`. The largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 10` is `5`, and `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10`, which is optimal.
- For `x = 7`, the divisors are `1, 7`. Since `7` is not less than `x`, the largest `y` is `1`, and `gcd(7, 1) + 1 = 2`.
- For `x = 21`, the divisors are `1, 3, 7, 21`. The largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 21` is `18` (not a divisor, so it checks the next largest divisor `7` which is not optimal, but the next largest `y` in the loop is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `7` and the next largest `y` which is not a divisor is `18` and the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18`), but the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 21` is `18` (not a divisor, so it checks the next largest divisor `7` which is not optimal, but the next largest `y` in the loop is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `7` and the next largest `y` which is not a divisor is `18` and the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18`), but the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 21` is `18` (not a divisor, so it checks the next largest divisor `7` which is not optimal, but the next largest `y` in the loop is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18` which is not a divisor but the next largest `y` which is a divisor is `18`).
- For `x = 100`, the divisors are `1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100`. The largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 100` is `98`, and `gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 198`.
- For `x = 2`, the only valid `y` is `1`, and `gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2`.
- For `x = 1000`, the divisors are `1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000`. The largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 1000` is `750`, and `gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 1750`.
- For `x = 6`, the divisors are `1, 2, 3, 6`. The largest `y` such that `2 * y >= 6` is `3`, and `gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6`.

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to be correct.
