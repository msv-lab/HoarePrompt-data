Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns a value `y` based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: If `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `y`, where `y` is a divisor of `x`.
- Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met, it returns `y - 1`.
- Case_3: If the condition in Case_2 is not met, it returns `y` which is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.**
