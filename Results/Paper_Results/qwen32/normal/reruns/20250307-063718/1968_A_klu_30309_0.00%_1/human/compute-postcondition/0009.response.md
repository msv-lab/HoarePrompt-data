The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `2` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` has a value such that the loop has not yet terminated. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by `1` and still be greater than `1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` has some value, and for the loop to continue, `y` should be `y - 1`. The state of `x` and `max_val` does not change based on the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` and 2 * y is less than x, otherwise `max_val` remains 1, `y` is `y - 1`**
