The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. If `y` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is decremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was decremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration (since it gets decremented at the end of each iteration).

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `max_val` remains unchanged**.

To be more specific, if `y` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `max_val` remains unchanged**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `y` from the previous iteration, we can express the state as:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration, and `max_val` remains unchanged**. 

But to reflect the decrement and the need for the next iteration, we can say:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration (so it is ready to be decremented again at the start of the next iteration), and `max_val` remains unchanged**.

For clarity in the format requested:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `max_val` remains unchanged**.

Since we need to adhere strictly to the variables in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
