The code snippet assigns the current value of `y` to `max_val`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The condition for returning `y` is not evaluated in this snippet, so the program does not return a value at this point. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `y + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `max_val` is equal to `y`.**
