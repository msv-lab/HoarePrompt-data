### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

The provided function `func_1(x)` iterates through possible values of \( y \) starting from \( x-1 \) down to \( 2 \). If it finds a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)), it checks if \( 2y \ge x \). If this condition is true, it immediately returns \( y \). If the loop completes without finding such a \( y \), it returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x/2 \), or \( 1 \) if no such divisor exists.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Immediate Return Condition**: If \( 2y \ge x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \) because \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2y \), which is maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible. This condition ensures that if a suitable \( y \) exists, it will be returned immediately.

2. **Fallback Condition**: If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x/2 \). This is a reasonable fallback because it ensures that \( y \) is still a divisor of \( x \), and among divisors less than \( x/2 \), it maximizes \( y \).

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where no suitable \( y \) exists by returning \( 1 \). This is valid because \( 1 \) is always a divisor of any integer \( x \).

The annotated states and the logic described in the comments accurately reflect the behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1(x)` correctly implements the logic to find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
