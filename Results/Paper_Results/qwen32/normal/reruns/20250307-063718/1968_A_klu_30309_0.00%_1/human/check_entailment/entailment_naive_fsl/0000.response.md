Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \leq y < x) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking for the first divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)) and returns it if \( 2y \geq x \). If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor found during the iteration.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the returned \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
- The function will check from 11 down to 2:
  - 11 is not a divisor.
  - 10 is not a divisor.
  - 9 is not a divisor.
  - 8 is not a divisor.
  - 7 is not a divisor.
  - 6 is a divisor, and \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \geq 12 \), so it returns 6.
- However, the optimal \( y \) should be 5 because:
  - \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

Here, \( y = 6 \) is not the optimal solution because \( y = 4 \) gives a higher value of \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 8 \).

Thus, the code does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), making the correctness **False**.
