You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \leq y < x) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking for the first divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)) and returns it if \( 2y \geq x \). If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor found during the iteration.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the returned \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
- The function will check from 11 down to 2:
  - 11 is not a divisor.
  - 10 is not a divisor.
  - 9 is not a divisor.
  - 8 is not a divisor.
  - 7 is not a divisor.
  - 6 is a divisor, and \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \geq 12 \), so it returns 6.
- However, the optimal \( y \) should be 5 because:
  - \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \).
  - \( \gcd(12, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

Here, \( y = 6 \) is not the optimal solution because \( y = 4 \) gives a higher value of \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 8 \).

Thus, the code does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), making the correctness **False**.
