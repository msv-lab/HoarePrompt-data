Given the initial state and the code snippet, we know that `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `max_val` is 1, `x` is divisible by `y`, and `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

The code snippet simply returns the value of `y`. Since `y` is a divisor of `x` and `2 * y` is at least `x`, the value of `y` can be determined based on these constraints. However, without a specific value for `x`, we can only describe `y` in terms of these constraints.

Output State: **The program returns `y`, which is a divisor of `x` such that `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`**.
