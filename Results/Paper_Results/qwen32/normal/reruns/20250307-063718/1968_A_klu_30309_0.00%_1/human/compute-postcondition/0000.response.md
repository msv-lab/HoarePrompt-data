The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not contain any executable code that modifies variables or performs calculations. The function is designed to find the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`, but no actual computation or assignment is performed in the given snippet. Therefore, the state of the variable `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
