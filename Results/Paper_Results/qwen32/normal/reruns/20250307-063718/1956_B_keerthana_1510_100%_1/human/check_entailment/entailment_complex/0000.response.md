Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points a player can get by playing optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally. The points are awarded based on whether a card's number already exists on the table. 

The code, however, calculates the difference between the total number of tokens (cards) and the number of unique tokens (unique card numbers) for each test case. This calculation does not account for the game dynamics, turns, or the optimal play strategy described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to simulate the game turns, keeping track of which card numbers have been placed on the table, and determine the optimal moves for both players. The provided code does not perform these tasks and thus does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
