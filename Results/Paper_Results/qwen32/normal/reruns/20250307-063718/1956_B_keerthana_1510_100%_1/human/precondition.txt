Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the list. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
