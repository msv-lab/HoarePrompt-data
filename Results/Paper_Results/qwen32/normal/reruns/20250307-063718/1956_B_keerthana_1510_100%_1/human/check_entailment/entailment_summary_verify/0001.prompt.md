You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then calculates and prints the number of integers that appear exactly once in each list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a card game against an optimal opponent (Nene). The game involves:
- Each player has `n` cards, with each card having a number from 1 to `n`.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table.
- You score a point if the card you place already has a matching card on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Insight:
The key insight is that you can only score a point if you place a card that has already been placed by either player. Since Nene is playing optimally, she will try to minimize your points. The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand. If you have `k` pairs, you can score at most `k` points because each pair can contribute to one point.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of points you can score, count the number of pairs of cards in your hand. This can be done by counting the occurrences of each card number and summing up the integer division of each count by 2.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the above logic. Let's break down what the program does:
- It reads every second line starting from the third line (which corresponds to the sequences of card numbers).
- For each sequence, it calculates the difference between the total number of cards (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique card numbers (`len({*tokens})`).

#### Why This is Incorrect:
- The provided program does not count the number of pairs correctly. It simply calculates the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards, which does not give the number of pairs.
- For example, if you have the cards `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`, the program will output `3 - 2 = 1`, but you can actually form one pair (`1, 1`), so you should get `1` point, which the program does correctly in this case, but this is not the general case. If you have `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, the program will output `8 - 2 = 6`, but you can form two pairs for each number, so you should get `4` points.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly generalize to all cases to find the maximum number of points you can score.

Correctness: **False**
