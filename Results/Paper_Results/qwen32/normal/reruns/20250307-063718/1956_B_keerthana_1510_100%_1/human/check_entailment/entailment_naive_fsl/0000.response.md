Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The program simply calculates the difference between the total number of cards you have and the number of unique cards you have, which does not account for the strategic play by Nene and the rules of the game.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Strategy**: The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. This requires a more complex strategy than just counting unique cards.
2. **Game Mechanics**: The game involves alternating turns, and the score is determined by whether a card with the same number is already on the table. The provided program does not simulate the turns or the placement of cards on the table.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the program (`len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens})`) calculates the number of duplicate cards you have, which is not directly related to the optimal strategy for scoring points.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves by both players. Here's a high-level outline of what a correct solution might look like:

1. **Count Card Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each card number in your hand.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Simulate the game by alternating turns and keeping track of the cards on the table.
3. **Optimal Play**: Implement a strategy for both players to play optimally, considering the rules and the goal of maximizing or minimizing points.

Since the provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not simulate the game mechanics, it is incorrect.
