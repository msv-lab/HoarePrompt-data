Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The function returns the number of distinct integers that appear exactly once in the list.**
