To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to understand the operations being performed on the variables and objects in the context of the initial state provided.

The initial state specifies that the input must have at least five lines, but it does not specify the content of `line`. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `line` is a string that represents a line of text from the input.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the code snippet:

1. `tokens := line.split()`: This uses the walrus operator (`:=`) to assign the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens`. The `split()` method splits the string `line` into a list of words (tokens) based on whitespace.

2. `len(tokens)`: This calculates the total number of tokens (words) in the list `tokens`.

3. `{*tokens}`: This converts the list `tokens` into a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, `{*tokens}` will contain only the unique tokens from the list `tokens`.

4. `len({*tokens})`: This calculates the number of unique tokens in the set.

5. `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`: This computes the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list `tokens`.

6. `print(...)`: This prints the result of the expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`.

Given the initial state does not specify the exact content of `line`, we cannot provide a numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the content of `line`.

Output: **the number of duplicate words in `line` (where `line` is a string representing a line of text from the input)**
