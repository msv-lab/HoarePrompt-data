To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the code and understand the operations being performed.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Line Splitting**: `tokens := line.split()`
   - This line splits the string `line` into a list of words (tokens) based on whitespace and assigns this list to the variable `tokens`.

2. **Length Calculation**:
   - `len(tokens)`: This calculates the number of tokens in the list `tokens`.
   - `{*tokens}`: This converts the list `tokens` into a set, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})`: This calculates the number of unique tokens in the set.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`: This subtracts the number of unique tokens from the total number of tokens, giving the count of duplicate tokens.

### Explanation:
- The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` will yield the number of duplicate tokens in the list `tokens`.
- Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `line`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the content of `line`.

### Final Output:
Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the list `tokens` (where `tokens` is the list of words obtained by splitting `line`)**
