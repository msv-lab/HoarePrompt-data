Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the number of integers that appear exactly once in each list of cards. However, the problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, considering Nene's optimal strategy to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The correct approach involves simulating the game with both players playing optimally, keeping track of the cards on the table, and calculating points based on the rules provided. The current program does not simulate the game or account for the strategic decisions that both players would make.

Correctness: **False**
