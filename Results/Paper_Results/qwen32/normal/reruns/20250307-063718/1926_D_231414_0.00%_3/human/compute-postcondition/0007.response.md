The provided code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`. The value assigned is `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is a constant representing the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`).

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an input integer; `check` is 2147483647.**
