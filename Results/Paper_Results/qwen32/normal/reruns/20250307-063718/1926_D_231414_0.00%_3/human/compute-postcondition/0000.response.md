Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and `a_j`) are not affected by this input statement.
