The code snippet provided decreases the value of the variable `ans` by 1. The other variables (`times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `check`, `s`) remain unchanged. Since the value of `ans` is decreased by 1, and the initial state specifies that `ans` is an input integer, the new value of `ans` is the original value minus 1.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `dic` is a dictionary and it contains the key `s`; `ans` is the original `ans` input integer minus 1; `check` is 2147483647; `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`. The value of `dic[s]` is decreased by 1.**
