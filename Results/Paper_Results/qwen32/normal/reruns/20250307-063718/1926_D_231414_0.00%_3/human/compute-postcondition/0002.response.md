The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is used as a throwaway variable, and `times`. The loop will execute based on the value of `times`. The other variables `n`, the list of integers, and `check` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Given that `times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `times` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop executes since the provided condition already satisfies this.

State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4**
