The code snippet assigns the value `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This operation does not affect any other variables provided in the initial state. The value of `check` is now a specific constant, which is `2147483647` (since `2 ** 31 - 1` equals `2147483647`).

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647.**
