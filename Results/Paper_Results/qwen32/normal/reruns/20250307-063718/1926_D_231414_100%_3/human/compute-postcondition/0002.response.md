The only variable in the loop head is `times`, which determines whether the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` and `check` are not in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `times` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `times` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `check` is 2147483647**
