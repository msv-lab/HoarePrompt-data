Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of the integer input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it holds the number of test cases, and `times` now holds the integer value read from the input.
