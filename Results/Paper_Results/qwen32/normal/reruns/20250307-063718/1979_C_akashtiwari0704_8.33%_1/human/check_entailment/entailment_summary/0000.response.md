### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers and then determining each bet as the product divided by the respective multiplier. This approach is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Distribution**: The goal is to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any single winning outcome. The provided program calculates bets based on the product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier, which does not guarantee that the sum of all bets will be less than the return for any single outcome.

2. **Sum Condition Violation**: The condition `if sumo >= prod` is checking whether the sum of the calculated bets is greater than or equal to the product of all multipliers. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement that the sum of all bets must be less than the return for any single winning outcome.

3. **Logical Flaw in Solution**: The logic of the program does not address the problem's requirement effectively. For example, in cases where all multipliers are the same, it will output `-1` because the sum of bets will equal the product of multipliers, which is not allowed.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
