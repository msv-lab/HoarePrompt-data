Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`**
