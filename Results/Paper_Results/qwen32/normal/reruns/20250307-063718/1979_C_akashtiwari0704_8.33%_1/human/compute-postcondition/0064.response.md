The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space; `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes; `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes; `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
