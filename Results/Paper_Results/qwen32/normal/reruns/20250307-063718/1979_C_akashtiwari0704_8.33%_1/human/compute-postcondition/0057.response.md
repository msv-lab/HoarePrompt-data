The code snippet provided adds the integer value of the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the variable `sumo`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index `1` of the list `a` will be added to `sumo`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]` and `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` and the rest of the elements are unchanged, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a` including the newly modified `a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a` including the newly modified `a[i]` plus `int(a[1])`, `ans` is the string representation of the first `bets` elements of `a` each followed by a space, `i` is 1, `T` is the current iteration count + 1.**

In simpler terms, `sumo` is now the original `sumo` plus the value of `a[1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
