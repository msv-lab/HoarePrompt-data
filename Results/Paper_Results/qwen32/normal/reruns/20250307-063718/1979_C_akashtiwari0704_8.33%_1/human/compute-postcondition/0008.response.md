The code snippet `prod *= a[i]` updates the value of `prod` by multiplying it with the element at index `i` of the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `bets`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer such that `bets` ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its previous value and `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `prod` is now the product of its previous value and the element at index `i` in the list `a`, while the other variables remain the same.
