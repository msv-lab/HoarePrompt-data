You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2

    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that iteration is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is a string of the elements in `a` each followed by a space.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

The problem requires distributing the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided program calculates a product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. This approach is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Bet Calculation**: The product of all multipliers can be extremely large, leading to very large bets that are not necessary and may not satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome.

2. **Non-Optimal Solution**: The program does not guarantee that the total bet is minimized or that the condition is met for all outcomes. It only checks if the sum of the calculated bets is less than the product, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where a solution might exist with smaller bets. For example, in the case where all multipliers are the same, a valid solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, but the program might not produce this solution.

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```

Explanation of the expected output: If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 3 coins. If any outcome wins, you receive back 2 coins, which is more than the total bet of 3 coins. However, since the problem asks for a distribution where the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome, a valid solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, as 1 < 2.

The provided program will not produce this solution because it calculates the product of the multipliers (2 * 2 * 2 = 8) and then divides this product by each multiplier, resulting in bets of 4, 4, and 4, which is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
