Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates a new list where each element is the product of all other elements in the original list. If the sum of the new list is greater than or equal to the product of the original list, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the new list as a space-separated string.**
