The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain the integers provided in the input, replacing its previous value.

Given the initial state, all other variables (`t`, `bets`, `prod`, `sumo`, `ans`, `i`, `T`) remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`, `ans` remains unchanged based on the previous conditions, `i` remains `bets - 1`, `T` is `bets`.**
