The code snippet `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given the initial state, the value of `prod` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `bets`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer such that `bets` ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its previous value and `a[i]`**.
