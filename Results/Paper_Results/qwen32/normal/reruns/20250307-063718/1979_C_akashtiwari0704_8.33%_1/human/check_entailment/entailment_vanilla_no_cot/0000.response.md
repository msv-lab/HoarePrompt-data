Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the product divided by each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The key issue with the program is that it does not ensure the condition that the sum of the bets (sumo) is strictly less than the product (prod) divided by each individual multiplier (a[i]). Instead, it checks if the sum of the bets is less than the product itself, which is not the correct condition to verify the problem's requirements.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to assign bets in such a way that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome. One simple way to achieve this is to assign a bet of 1 to the first outcome and 0 to all other outcomes. This way, the total bet is 1, and the amount received for the winning outcome will be at least 2 (since the minimum multiplier is 2), ensuring that the condition is met.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Assign 1 to the first outcome and 0 to all other outcomes
        ans = [1] + [0] * (bets - 1)
        # Check if the condition is met
        if a[0] > 1:
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that meets the problem's requirements. However, the original program does not guarantee this, making it incorrect.
