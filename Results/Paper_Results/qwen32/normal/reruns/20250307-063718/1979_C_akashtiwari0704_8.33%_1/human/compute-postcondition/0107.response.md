Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the `t` iterations, `bets` is an integer, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`. `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`. `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that iteration is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is a string of the elements in `a` each followed by a space.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains the same. For each iteration, the list `a` is transformed such that each element is the product of all other elements in the original list. The product of these transformed elements is `prod`, and their sum is `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program outputs `-1` for that iteration. Otherwise, it outputs the transformed list `a` as a space-separated string.
