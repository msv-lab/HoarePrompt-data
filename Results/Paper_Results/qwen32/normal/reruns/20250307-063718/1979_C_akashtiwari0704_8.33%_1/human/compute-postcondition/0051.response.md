The variable `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`, `ans` is the string representation of the first `bets` elements of `a` each followed by a space, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` is the current iteration count + 1**.
