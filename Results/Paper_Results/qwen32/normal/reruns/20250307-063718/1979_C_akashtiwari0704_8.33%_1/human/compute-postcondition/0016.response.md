The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was initially 0, and after the execution of the code, it will be the integer value of `a[i]`. The other variables, `t`, `bets`, `a`, and `prod`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[i])`.**
