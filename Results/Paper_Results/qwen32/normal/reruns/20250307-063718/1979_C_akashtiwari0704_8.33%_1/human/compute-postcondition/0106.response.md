Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` from the initial `prod`, `prod` is the product of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` remains unchanged. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of all `a[i]` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
