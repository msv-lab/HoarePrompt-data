Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `ans` is an empty string; `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes; `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes; `sumo` is less than `prod`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space; `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes; `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes; `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space; `i` is `bets`; `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space appended to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `i` is `bets + 1`; `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space appended twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
