Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` for `i != 3` remains unchanged and `a[3]` is now `prod // a[3]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[i]) + int(a[3])`, `i` is 3**

Natural Language: The value of `sumo` has been updated to the sum of its previous value and the value of `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
