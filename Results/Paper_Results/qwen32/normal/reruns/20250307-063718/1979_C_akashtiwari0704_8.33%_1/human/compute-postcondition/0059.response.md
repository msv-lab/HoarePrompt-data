Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `bets` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`. `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`. `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a` and is greater than or equal to `prod`. `ans` remains the string representation of the first `bets` elements of the original list `a` each followed by a space. `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes. `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes.**
