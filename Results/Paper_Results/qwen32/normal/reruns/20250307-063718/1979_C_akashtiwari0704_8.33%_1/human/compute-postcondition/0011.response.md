The code multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Therefore, the new value of `prod` is the product of its previous value and `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `bets`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer such that `bets` ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its previous value and `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
