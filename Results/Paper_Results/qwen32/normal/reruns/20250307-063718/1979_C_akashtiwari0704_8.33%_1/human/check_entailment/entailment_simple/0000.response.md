Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a product of all multipliers and then determining bets for each outcome based on the product divided by the respective multiplier. However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bet for each outcome. This does not guarantee that the total sum of bets is less than the return for each outcome.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `3 3 2 7`
- The product of multipliers is `3 * 2 * 7 = 42`.
- The bets calculated by the program are `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, and `42 // 7 = 6`. 
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
- If the third outcome wins, the return is `7 * 6 = 42`, which is not strictly greater than the total bet of `41`.

However, a correct strategy would be to bet `27`, `41`, and `12` as given in the example output. This is because:
- Total bet is `27 + 41 + 12 = 80`.
- Returns are `3 * 27 = 81`, `2 * 41 = 82`, and `7 * 12 = 84`, all of which are strictly greater than `80`.

The program's logic does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
