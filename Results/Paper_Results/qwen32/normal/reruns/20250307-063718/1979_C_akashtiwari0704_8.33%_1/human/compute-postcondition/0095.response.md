The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides various variable definitions and conditions, but the `print` statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables directly.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print(-1)`.
- This statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `ans`, `i`, or `T`.

Given this information, the output is simply the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
