The only variable in the loop head is `T` and the range is determined by `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `T` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it will be initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Since the loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and `T` is initialized by the `range` function, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, read from input** (No further adjustment needed for `T` as it is controlled by the loop head)
