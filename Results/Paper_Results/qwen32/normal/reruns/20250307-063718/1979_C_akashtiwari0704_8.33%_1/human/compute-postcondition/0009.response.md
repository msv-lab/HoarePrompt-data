Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer such that `bets` ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its previous value and `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`. The new value of `prod` is the previous value of `prod` multiplied by `a[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `prod` has been updated to be the product of its previous value and the current element `a[i]` from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `bets`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
