The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1` to the console, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo` described in the initial state. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because it explicitly specifies the value to be printed.

Based on the information provided and the nature of the `print` statement, the output is:

Output: **-1**
