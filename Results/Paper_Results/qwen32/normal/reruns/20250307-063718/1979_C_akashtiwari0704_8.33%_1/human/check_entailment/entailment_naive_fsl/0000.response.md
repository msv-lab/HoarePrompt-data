Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

The problem requires distributing the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided program calculates a product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. This approach is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Bet Calculation**: The product of all multipliers can be extremely large, leading to very large bets that are not necessary and may not satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome.

2. **Non-Optimal Solution**: The program does not guarantee that the total bet is minimized or that the condition is met for all outcomes. It only checks if the sum of the calculated bets is less than the product, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where a solution might exist with smaller bets. For example, in the case where all multipliers are the same, a valid solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, but the program might not produce this solution.

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```

Explanation of the expected output: If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 3 coins. If any outcome wins, you receive back 2 coins, which is more than the total bet of 3 coins. However, since the problem asks for a distribution where the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome, a valid solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, as 1 < 2.

The provided program will not produce this solution because it calculates the product of the multipliers (2 * 2 * 2 = 8) and then divides this product by each multiplier, resulting in bets of 4, 4, and 4, which is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
