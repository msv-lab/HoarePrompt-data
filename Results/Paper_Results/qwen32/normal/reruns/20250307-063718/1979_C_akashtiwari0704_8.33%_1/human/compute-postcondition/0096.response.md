Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` from the initial `prod`, `prod` is the product of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` remains unchanged, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
