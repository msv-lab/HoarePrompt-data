The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer is input by the user, but it will still satisfy the initial condition's range constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, read from input.**
