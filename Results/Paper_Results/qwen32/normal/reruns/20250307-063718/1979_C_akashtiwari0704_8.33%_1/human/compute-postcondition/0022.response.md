Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer and must be greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` for `i != 3, 4` remains unchanged, `a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`, `a[4]` is `prod // a[4]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[i]) + int(a[3]) + int(a[4])`, `i` is 4**.

In simpler terms, the value of `sumo` has been updated by adding `int(a[4])` to its previous value, which was `int(a[i]) + int(a[3])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
