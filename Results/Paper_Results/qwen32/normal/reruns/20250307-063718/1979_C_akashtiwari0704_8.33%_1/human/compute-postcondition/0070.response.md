To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not directly influence the value of `ans`.
2. **bets**: An integer. This variable is used to determine the value of `i` and `T`.
3. **a**: A list of elements. The exact elements are not specified, but they are used to form the string `ans`.
4. **prod**: An integer. It is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.
5. **sumo**: An integer that is less than `prod`. It is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.
6. **ans**: A string formed by concatenating each element of the list `a` followed by a space.
7. **i**: An integer set to `bets - 1`. This variable does not directly influence the value of `ans`.
8. **T**: An integer set to `bets + 1`. This variable does not directly influence the value of `ans`.

### Key Variable for Output:
The variable `ans` is the string that will be printed. According to the description, `ans` is constructed by taking each element in the list `a` and appending a space after each element.

### Example Construction of `ans`:
If `a` is a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, then `ans` would be constructed as follows:
- Take the first element `1` and append a space: `"1 "`
- Take the second element `2` and append a space: `"1 2 "`
- Take the third element `3` and append a space: `"1 2 3 "`

So, `ans` would be `"1 2 3 "`.

### Output:
Based on the above explanation, the `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating each element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string formed by concatenating each element of the list `a` followed by a space)**
