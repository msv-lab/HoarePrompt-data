Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `ans` is the string representation of the first `bets` elements of `a` each followed by a space, and `i` is set to `bets - 1`.**
