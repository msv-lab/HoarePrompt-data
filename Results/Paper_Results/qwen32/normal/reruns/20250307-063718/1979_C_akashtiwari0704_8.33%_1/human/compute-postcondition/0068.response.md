The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`) are not modified by this statement.

Given the initial state, `ans` already includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. After executing the code snippet, `ans` will include another string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`; `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `i` is `bets + 1`; `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space appended twice.**
