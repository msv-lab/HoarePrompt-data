Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, read from input.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `ans` is the string representation of the first `bets` elements of `a` each followed by a space, and `i` is set to `bets - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `bets` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is the product of all other elements in the original list `a`. `prod` is the product of the transformed list `a`. `sumo` is the sum of the elements in the transformed list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `ans` remains the string representation of the first `bets` elements of the original list `a` each followed by a space. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, then `ans` is a string of the elements in `a` each followed by a space. `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes. `T` will be `bets + 1` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` from the initial `prod`, `prod` is the product of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` remains unchanged. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of all `a[i]` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
