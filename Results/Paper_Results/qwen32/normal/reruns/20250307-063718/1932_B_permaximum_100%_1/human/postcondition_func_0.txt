The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in each list `a` and returns a list of these LCM values corresponding to each test case.
