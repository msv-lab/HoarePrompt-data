To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `current_year` variable based on the values in the list `a`.

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.
- For each `ai`, it checks if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`.
  - If true, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
  - If false, it sets `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- After determining `next_year`, it updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
- This process repeats for all elements in `a`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the list `a`. This is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in `a`.

### Conclusion:
The final `current_year` after all iterations will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the list `a`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing for all elements in the list `a`, the `current_year` will be the smallest number that is divisible by each and every number in the list `a`.
