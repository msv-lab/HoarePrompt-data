The only object in the loop head is the variable `test`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again for the next `test` element.

At the end of the last iteration, `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, and `results` includes `current_year` as its last element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `test_cases` to assign to `test`.

State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes `current_year` as its last element, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`**
