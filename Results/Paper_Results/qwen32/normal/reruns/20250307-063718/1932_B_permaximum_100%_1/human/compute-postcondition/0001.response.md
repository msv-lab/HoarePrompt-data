In the provided task, the for loop iterates over `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are directly involved in the loop head, and `t` indicates the number of test cases in `test_cases`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is an empty list (this variable is not in the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute).

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one test case, which means `t` must be at least 1. Additionally, since `t` is the number of test cases in `test_cases`, `test_cases` should have exactly `t` test cases.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `test_cases` contains exactly `t` test cases.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list**
