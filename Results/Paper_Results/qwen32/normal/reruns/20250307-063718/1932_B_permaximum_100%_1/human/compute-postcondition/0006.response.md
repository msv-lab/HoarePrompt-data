The code snippet provided increments `current_year` by the value of `ai`. Given the initial state, `current_year` starts at 0 and `ai` is one of the integers in the list `a` that satisfies `current_year % ai == 0`. Since `current_year` is initially 0, `ai` can be any integer from the list `a` because 0 is divisible by any non-zero integer.

After executing the code, `next_year` is assigned the value of `current_year + ai`. Since `current_year` is 0, `next_year` will be equal to `ai`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`. `current_year` is 0 and `current_year % ai == 0` for some `ai` in the list `a`. `next_year` is `ai`.**
