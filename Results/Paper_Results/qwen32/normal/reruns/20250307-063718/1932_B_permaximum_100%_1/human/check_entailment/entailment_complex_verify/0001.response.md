### Reasoning:
The provided Python code correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic for determining the next occurrence of each sign is accurate:

1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration**: For each sign's periodicity `ai`:
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next occurrence is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which correctly finds the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
3. **Update**: `current_year` is updated to the next occurrence.
4. **Result**: After processing all signs, `current_year` is the year of the n-th sign.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code are mostly accurate, but there is a slight misinterpretation in the final state comment. The program does not calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `a` for each test case. Instead, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the sequential occurrence of each sign.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the code reads the input, processes each test case by determining the next occurrence of each sign, and outputs the correct year for the n-th sign. The verification steps with the example inputs also correctly demonstrate that the code produces the expected outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
