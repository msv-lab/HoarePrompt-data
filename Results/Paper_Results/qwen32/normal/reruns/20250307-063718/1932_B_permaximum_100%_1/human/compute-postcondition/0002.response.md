The code snippet assigns the values from the first test case in the `test_cases` list to the variables `n` and `a`. Therefore, `n` will be the first element of the tuple, and `a` will be the second element of the tuple, which is a list of integers.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains unchanged, and `results` remains an empty list. The variables `n` and `a` are updated to hold the values from the first test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.**
