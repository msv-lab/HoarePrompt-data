The only objects in the loop head are `test` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, and `a` is the second element of `test`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still have at least one more element. The `test` variable will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`**
