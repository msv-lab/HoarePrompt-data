Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and their periodicities, `a`.
3. The `func_1` function processes each test case:
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next occurrence year:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year.
4. The function appends the final `current_year` (the year of the n-th sign's occurrence) to the results list.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as per the problem statement and produces the expected output for the provided examples.
