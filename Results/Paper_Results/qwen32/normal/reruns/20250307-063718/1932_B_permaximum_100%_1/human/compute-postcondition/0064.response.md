The code snippet provided only reassigns `current_year` to the value of `next_year`. No other variables are modified or used in the calculation. Therefore, `current_year` will now hold the same value as `next_year`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element, `next_year` is updated to `next_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, otherwise `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`.**
