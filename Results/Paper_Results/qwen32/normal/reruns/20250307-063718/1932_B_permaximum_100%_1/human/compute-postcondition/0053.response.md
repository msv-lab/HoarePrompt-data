Postcondition: **`current_year` is 0, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is an element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
