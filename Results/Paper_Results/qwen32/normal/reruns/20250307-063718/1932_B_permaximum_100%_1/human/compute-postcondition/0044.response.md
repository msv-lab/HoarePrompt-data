The code appends the value of `current_year` to the `results` list. The other variables (`current_year`, `test_cases`, `test`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test`.**
