The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. However, based on the provided state, `a` is already defined as the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and since `test_cases` contains `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple `(n, a)` and `n` is the length of the list `a`, we can assume that `a` is not empty (because `1 <= n <= 100`).

The state provided already ensures that `a` has at least one element, so no adjustment is needed for `a` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `ai` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

However, since the task is to adhere strictly to the objects in the loop head and adjust them if necessary, and since `ai` is just an iteration variable, we don't need to adjust its state explicitly. The state of `a` is already correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `a` is not empty.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`. `current_year` is 0**
