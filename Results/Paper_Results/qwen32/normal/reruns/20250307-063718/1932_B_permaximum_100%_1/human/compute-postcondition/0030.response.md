The code calculates `next_year` based on the current `current_year` and the first element `ai` of the iterable `a`. Given that `current_year` is not divisible by any element `ai` in `a`, the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` will compute the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

Thus, the value of `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

Output State: **`current_year` is 0, `results` includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and `a` must be an iterable with at least one element, and `current_year` is not divisible by any element `ai` in `a`; `next_year` is `(0 // ai + 1) * ai`, which simplifies to `ai` since `current_year` is 0.**

In natural language: `current_year` remains 0, `results` still includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `test_cases` still has at least one more element, `test` is still the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is still the first element of `test`, and `a` is still the second element of `test` with at least one element. `current_year` is still not divisible by any element `ai` in `a`. `next_year` is calculated as `ai` because `current_year` is 0.
