Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_year` is 0, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` (previously the LCM of all elements in `a`) as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test`.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is an element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `next_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element, `next_year` is updated to `next_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, otherwise `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
