Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities of the signs. The program iterates through each test case and calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially according to the rules specified.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:
1. For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0.
2. It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a` for that test case.
3. For each `ai`, it checks if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`. If it is, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`.
4. If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
5. The `current_year` is then updated to this `next_year`.
6. This process repeats for all signs in the test case.
7. After processing all signs, the `current_year` holds the year in which the n-th sign will occur, and this value is appended to the `results` list.
8. Finally, the `results` list is returned, containing the year for the n-th sign for each test case.

The program's logic correctly implements the rules for determining the year of the n-th sign's occurrence, and it does not attempt to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) as incorrectly stated in the comments.

Correctness: **True**
