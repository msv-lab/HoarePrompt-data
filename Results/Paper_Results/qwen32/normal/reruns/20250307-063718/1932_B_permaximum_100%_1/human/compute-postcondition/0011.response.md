The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a` after the current `ai`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the current element from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Since `current_year` is `a[0]` and we are iterating through `a`, after the first iteration, `ai` would have been `a[0]`. For the next iteration, `ai` should be `a[1]`, and so on.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is `a[0]`, `ai` is the second element of `a`**
