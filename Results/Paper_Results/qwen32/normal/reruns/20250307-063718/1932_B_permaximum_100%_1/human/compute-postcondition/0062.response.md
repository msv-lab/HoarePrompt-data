Given the initial state and the code snippet, `next_year` is recalculated based on the current value of `current_year` and `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

The code snippet updates `next_year` to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. Since `current_year` is initially `next_year`, the new `next_year` will be calculated using this formula.

Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`.**

In natural language: `next_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. All other variables retain their initial states except for `next_year`, which is recalculated.
