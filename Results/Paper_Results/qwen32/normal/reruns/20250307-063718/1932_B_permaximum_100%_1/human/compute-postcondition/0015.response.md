The code snippet updates the value of `current_year` to `next_year`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code execution.

Given that `next_year` is calculated based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0`, the value of `current_year` will be updated to either `current_year + ai` or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is `next_year`, `ai` is the second element of `a`.**

In simpler terms, the `current_year` is now set to `next_year`, which is calculated based on the divisibility condition with `ai`. All other variables retain their initial values.
