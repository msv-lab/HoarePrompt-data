Reasoning:
The provided program does not actually calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in each list `a`. Instead, it correctly computes the year in which the nth sign will occur based on the problem's requirements. The program iterates through each test case, and for each sign, it determines the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign. 

The logic is as follows:
1. Start with `current_year` set to 0.
2. For each sign with periodicity `ai`, calculate the next occurrence year:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
3. Update `current_year` to the `next_year` and continue to the next sign.
4. After processing all signs, `current_year` will be the year in which the nth sign occurs.

This logic aligns with the problem description and the example provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
