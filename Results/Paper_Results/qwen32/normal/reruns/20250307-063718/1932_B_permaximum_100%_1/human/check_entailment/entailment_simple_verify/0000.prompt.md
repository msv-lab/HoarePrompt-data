You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`a`).

2. **Logic for Determining the Year of the Nth Sign**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year the sign will occur is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year the sign will occur is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - `current_year` is then updated to `next_year`.
   - After processing all periodicities, `current_year` will hold the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the year for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the next sign starts occurring only after the previous one has occurred, and it correctly calculates the next occurrence year based on the periodicity.

The example inputs provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, producing the expected outputs. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the provided problem description.
