The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is `next_year`, `ai` is the third element of `a`.**
