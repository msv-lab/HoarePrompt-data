Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary provided to verify the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the second sign can only occur after the first sign has occurred, and so on.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Year of the Nth Sign**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year the sign will occur is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year the sign will occur is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - `current_year` is then updated to `next_year`.
   - After processing all periodicities, `current_year` will hold the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the year for each test case.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided states that the function calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in each list `a` and returns a list of these LCM values. However, this summary is incorrect. The provided program does not calculate the LCM of the list of periodicities. Instead, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the sequential occurrence logic described in the problem statement.

### Verification Against the Problem Description
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. It ensures that each sign occurs sequentially and calculates the correct year for each sign's occurrence.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Calculation:
     - `current_year = 0`
     - First sign: `current_year = 3`
     - Second sign: `current_year = 4`
     - Third sign: `current_year = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36`
   - Output: `36`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `current_year = 0`
     - First sign: `current_year = 1`
     - Second sign: `current_year = 2`
     - Third sign: `current_year = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `current_year = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `current_year = 5`
   - Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `current_year = 0`
     - First sign: `current_year = 1`
     - Second sign: `current_year = 2`
     - Third sign: `current_year = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `current_year = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `current_year = 5`
   - Output: `5`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Calculation:
     - `current_year = 0`
     - First sign: `current_year = 50`
     - Second sign: `current_year = 60`
     - Third sign: `current_year = 761`
     - Fourth sign: `current_year = 961`
     - Fifth sign: `current_year = 1464`
     - Sixth sign: `current_year = 2012`
   - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. The function summary is incorrect, but the program itself is correct.

**Final: True**
