The value of `next_year` is updated to be the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. Since `current_year` is initially equal to `next_year`, the new value of `next_year` effectively becomes `next_year + ai`.

Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `next_year` is `next_year + ai`, `results` includes the previous `current_year` (which is 0) as its last element, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and `a` must be an iterable with at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`.**
