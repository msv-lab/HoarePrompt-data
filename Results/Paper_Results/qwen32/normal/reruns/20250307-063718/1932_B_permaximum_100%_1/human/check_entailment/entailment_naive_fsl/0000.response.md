Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`a`).

2. **Logic for Determining the Year of the Nth Sign**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year the sign will occur is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year the sign will occur is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - `current_year` is then updated to `next_year`.
   - After processing all periodicities, `current_year` will hold the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the year for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the next sign starts occurring only after the previous one has occurred, and it correctly calculates the next occurrence year based on the periodicity.

The example inputs provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, producing the expected outputs. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the provided problem description.
