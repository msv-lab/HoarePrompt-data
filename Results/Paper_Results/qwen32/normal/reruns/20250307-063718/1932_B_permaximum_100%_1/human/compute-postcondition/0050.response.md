Output State: **`current_year` is 0, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` (which is 0) as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is an element of `a`, and `current_year % ai == 0`; `next_year` is `ai`.**

Explanation: The value of `next_year` is calculated as `current_year + ai`. Given that `current_year` is 0, `next_year` becomes equal to `ai`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
