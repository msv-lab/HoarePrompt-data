Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `next_year` is `current_year` + `ai`, `results` includes the previous `current_year` (which is 0) as its last element, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and `a` must be an iterable with at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. All other variables retain their initial states.
