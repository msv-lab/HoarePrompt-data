The code snippet updates the value of `next_year` by adding the value of `ai` to the current value of `current_year`. Since `current_year` is initially equal to `next_year`, the new value of `next_year` will be the old value of `next_year` plus `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `next_year` is `next_year + ai`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `next_year + ai` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`**.
