Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` containing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`.**
