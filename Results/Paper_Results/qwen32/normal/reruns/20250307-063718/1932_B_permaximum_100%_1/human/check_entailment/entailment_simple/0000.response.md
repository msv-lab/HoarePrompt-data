Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iteratively determining the year in which each sign will occur, starting from year 0:
   - If the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity of the sign (`current_year % ai == 0`), the next occurrence of the sign will be `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next occurrence of the sign will be the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
4. It updates `current_year` to `next_year` and repeats the process for the next sign.
5. After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The key point is that the program correctly calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence by considering the sequential nature of the signs and their respective periodicities.

The comment in the code stating that `results` contains the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases` is incorrect. The program does not calculate the LCM; instead, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the sequential occurrence requirement.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem, even though the comment about LCM is misleading.

Correctness: **True**
