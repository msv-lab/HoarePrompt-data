You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully examine the provided Python code and verify if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
     - The second line contains `n` integers representing the periodicity of each sign, `a_i`.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

### Key Points:
- The `i`-th sign occurs in years `a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, ...`.
- The tribe waits for each sign to occur sequentially, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads the input correctly and processes each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` are read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the code initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity `ai`:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which finds the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
     - The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence.
   - After processing all signs, the final `current_year` (which is the year of the `n`-th sign) is appended to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed.

### Verification:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 3 (3 % 3 == 0)
     - Year 3: Second sign at 4 (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4
     - Year 4: Third sign at 8 (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8
     - Year 8: Fourth sign at 10 (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10
     - Year 10: Fifth sign at 18 (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18
     - Year 18: Sixth sign at 36 (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36
   - Expected Output: `36`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
     - Year 1: Second sign at 2 (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2
     - Year 2: Third sign at 3 (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3
     - Year 3: Fourth sign at 4 (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4
     - Year 4: Fifth sign at 5 (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5
   - Expected Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
     - Year 1: Second sign at 2 (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2
     - Year 2: Third sign at 3 (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3
     - Year 3: Fourth sign at 4 (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4
     - Year 4: Fifth sign at 5 (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5
   - Expected Output: `5`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 50 (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50
     - Year 50: Second sign at 60 (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60
     - Year 60: Third sign at 711 (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711
     - Year 711: Fourth sign at 1000 (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 1000
     - Year 1000: Fifth sign at 1509 (1000 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1509
     - Year 1509: Sixth sign at 2012 (1509 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012
   - Expected Output: `2012`

The code correctly computes the year of the `n`-th sign for each test case, matching the expected outputs.
