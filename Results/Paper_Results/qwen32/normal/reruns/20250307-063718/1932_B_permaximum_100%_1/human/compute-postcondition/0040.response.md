Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes the previous `current_year` (which is 0) as its last element, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and `a` must be an iterable with at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`, `next_year` is `((current_year // ai + 1) * ai)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `next_year` is recalculated based on the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
