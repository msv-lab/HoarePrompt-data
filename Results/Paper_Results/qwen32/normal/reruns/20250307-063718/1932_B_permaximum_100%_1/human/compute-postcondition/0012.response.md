Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is `a[0]`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `test_cases` remains a list of test cases, `results` is still an empty list, `n` and `a` remain the first test case's elements, `current_year` remains the first element of `a`, `ai` remains the second element of `a`, and `next_year` is calculated as the sum of `current_year` and `ai`.
