Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `results` includes `current_year` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes 0 as its second last element and the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last two elements, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
