### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its annotations, considering the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The objective is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs in a periodic manner and must occur sequentially.
   - For each sign, the next occurrence year is the smallest multiple of its periodicity that is greater than the year the previous sign occurred.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence year is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year.
   - The final `current_year` after processing all periodicities is the year the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations state that `results` is a list containing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`. However, this is not accurate. The program does not compute the LCM of the list `a`. Instead, it calculates the year of the sequential occurrence of signs based on their individual periodicities.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claims that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The assessment correctly identifies that the program handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the next occurrence year based on the periodicity.
   - The example inputs are correctly handled, producing the expected outputs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
   - The annotations are misleading as they incorrectly state that the program computes the LCM of the list `a`. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program, as it correctly calculates the year of the n-th sign based on the given periodicities.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for all potential cases as per the provided problem description.
