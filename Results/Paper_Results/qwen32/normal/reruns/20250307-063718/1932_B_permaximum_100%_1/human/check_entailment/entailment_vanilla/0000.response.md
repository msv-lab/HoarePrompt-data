Let's carefully examine the provided Python code and verify if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
     - The second line contains `n` integers representing the periodicity of each sign, `a_i`.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

### Key Points:
- The `i`-th sign occurs in years `a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, ...`.
- The tribe waits for each sign to occur sequentially, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads the input correctly and processes each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` are read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the code initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity `ai`:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which finds the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
     - The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence.
   - After processing all signs, the final `current_year` (which is the year of the `n`-th sign) is appended to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed.

### Verification:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 3 (3 % 3 == 0)
     - Year 3: Second sign at 4 (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4
     - Year 4: Third sign at 8 (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8
     - Year 8: Fourth sign at 10 (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10
     - Year 10: Fifth sign at 18 (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18
     - Year 18: Sixth sign at 36 (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36
   - Expected Output: `36`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
     - Year 1: Second sign at 2 (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2
     - Year 2: Third sign at 3 (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3
     - Year 3: Fourth sign at 4 (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4
     - Year 4: Fifth sign at 5 (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5
   - Expected Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
     - Year 1: Second sign at 2 (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2
     - Year 2: Third sign at 3 (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3
     - Year 3: Fourth sign at 4 (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4
     - Year 4: Fifth sign at 5 (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5
   - Expected Output: `5`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Steps:
     - Year 0: First sign at 50 (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50
     - Year 50: Second sign at 60 (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60
     - Year 60: Third sign at 711 (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711
     - Year 711: Fourth sign at 1000 (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 1000
     - Year 1000: Fifth sign at 1509 (1000 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1509
     - Year 1509: Sixth sign at 2012 (1509 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012
   - Expected Output: `2012`

The code correctly computes the year of the `n`-th sign for each test case, matching the expected outputs.

The provided Python code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
