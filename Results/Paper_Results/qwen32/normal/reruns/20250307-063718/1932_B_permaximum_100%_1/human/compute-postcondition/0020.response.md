The given code snippet only updates the value of `current_year` by assigning it the value of `next_year`. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `current_year` which now holds the value that `next_year` had before this assignment. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is `next_year`, `ai` is the third element of `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
