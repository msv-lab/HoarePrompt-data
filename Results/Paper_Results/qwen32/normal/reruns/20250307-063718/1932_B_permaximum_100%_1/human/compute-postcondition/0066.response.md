The code snippet `results.append(current_year)` appends the value of `current_year` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `current_year` is already the LCM of all elements in `a`, and `results` includes 0 as its last element and the LCM of all elements in `a` as its new last element. Therefore, after the code execution, `results` will have an additional element which is the LCM of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `results` includes 0 as its second last element and the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last two elements, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test`.**
