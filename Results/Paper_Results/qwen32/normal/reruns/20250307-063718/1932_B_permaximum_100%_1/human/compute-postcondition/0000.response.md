The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `results` is an empty list.**
