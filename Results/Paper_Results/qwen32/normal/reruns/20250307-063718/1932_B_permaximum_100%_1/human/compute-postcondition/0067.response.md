Output State: **`results` is a list containing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the LCM of the integers in the list `a` for every test case provided in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to the LCM calculated for each respective test case.
