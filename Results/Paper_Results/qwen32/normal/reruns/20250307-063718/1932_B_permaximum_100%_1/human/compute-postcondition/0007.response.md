Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with `n` being an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`. `current_year` is 0, and for each `ai` in `a`, `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0.**
