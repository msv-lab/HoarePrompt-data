The code snippet `results.append(current_year)` appends the value of `current_year` to the list `results`. The value of `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in the list `a`. The values of `a` and `current_year` remain unchanged, but `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.

Output State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `results` includes `current_year` as its last element.**
