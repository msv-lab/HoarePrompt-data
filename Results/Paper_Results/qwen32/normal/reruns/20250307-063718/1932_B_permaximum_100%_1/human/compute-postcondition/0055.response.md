The only object in the loop head is the variable `ai`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements of the list `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the last element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `a` that has not been iterated over yet. Therefore, `ai` should be the next element in `a`.

Given that `a` must have at least one element and `ai` is an element of `a`, we need to adjust `ai` to the next element in `a`. 

State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `current_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`**
