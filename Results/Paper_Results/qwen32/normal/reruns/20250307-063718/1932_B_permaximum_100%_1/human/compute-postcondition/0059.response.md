Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`, `results` includes 0 as its last element and `next_year` as its new last element, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet simply reassigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. Therefore, `current_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
