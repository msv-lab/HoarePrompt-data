Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` but this value is not used in the provided snippet.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not explicitly defined in the snippet, we can infer it's used in determining `v2` and `prev`).
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i` (where `i` is not explicitly defined in the snippet, but from the context, it seems `i` is the highest value of `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'>'`).
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly given as 0.
- `v2` is defined as `i`, but `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided snippet. However, based on the context, it seems `i` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`. Since `i` is not explicitly given, we can only say `v2` is `i`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The first and second placeholders in the formatted string will be `v1`, which is 0.
- The third and fourth placeholders in the formatted string will be `v2`, which is `i`.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined and we only know it is the highest value of `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'>'`, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

### Output:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the highest value of i from 1 to n-1 for which the response was '>')**
