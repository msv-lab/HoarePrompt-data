The given code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v1` is 0 and `v2` is 1. After executing the code, `v1` will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received and is `'<'`, `i` is 1.**
