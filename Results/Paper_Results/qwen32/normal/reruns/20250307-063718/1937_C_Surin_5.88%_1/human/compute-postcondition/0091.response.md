The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `prev` will now hold the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 2, `r` is the last response received from `input()`, `i` is 2**
