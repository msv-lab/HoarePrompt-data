To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and used in the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `kp` is 0.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.
- `r` is the input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This variable is defined as the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response `r` was `'<'`. Since we don't have any specific information about the responses, we can only describe `v1` in terms of the condition given.
2. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration, but we don't know the current value of `i` since it depends on previous iterations.
3. **`prev`**: This variable is set to `i` if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise it remains 0. Again, without knowing the specific responses, we can only describe `prev` based on the condition.

Given these conditions, we can provide a description of the output in terms of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. Since the exact values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` depend on the responses received during the execution, we will describe them in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the highest value of i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '<', [i] is the current value of i, and [prev] is i if the response was '>', otherwise 0)**
