Postcondition: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3 if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `v2` is 3, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, `i` is 3.**
