The code snippet provided is `prev = i`. This line assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `prev` after the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `r` is the input string, and `r` equals `'>'`.**
