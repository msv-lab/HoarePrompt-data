Postcondition: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is the input string.**
