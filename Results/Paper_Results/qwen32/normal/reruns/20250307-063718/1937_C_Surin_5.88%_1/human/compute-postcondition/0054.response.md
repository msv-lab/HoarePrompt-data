The provided code snippet only contains a single line that sets the variable `g` to 0. None of the other variables (`kp`, `n`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`**
