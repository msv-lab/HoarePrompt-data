You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: kp is equal to the total number of test cases minus one, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` for the current test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the element in `p` that has the highest value, `v2` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop, `prev` is the index of the element in `p` that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, gives the maximum value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function interacts with the user to determine a pair of indices in a permutation of integers that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices. It outputs the pair of indices in the format "! i j" for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized among all pairs. The XOR operation between two numbers is maximized when the numbers have as many differing bits as possible. 

### Program Analysis
The program uses a strategy based on comparing bitwise OR results to infer the maximum XOR pair. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Value**:
   - It initializes `v1` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\), comparing the bitwise OR of `v1` with itself against the bitwise OR of `v1` with the current index `i`.
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it updates `v1` to the current index `i`.
   - This loop is intended to find an index `v1` that has the maximum possible bitwise OR value when combined with any other index in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - It initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\), comparing the bitwise OR of `v1` with `i` against the bitwise OR of `v1` with `prev`.
   - If the result of the comparison is `>`, it updates `prev` to the current index `i`.
   - This loop is intended to find an index `prev` such that the XOR of `v1` with `prev` is maximized.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loops, it outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program's strategy seems to be based on the idea that the maximum XOR value can be inferred from the maximum OR value, but this is not necessarily true. The program does not guarantee that the pair `(prev, v1)` will yield the maximum XOR value.

### Flaws in the Program
- **Inference of Maximum XOR**: The program assumes that finding the index with the maximum bitwise OR value and then comparing it with other indices will yield the maximum XOR. However, the XOR operation is not directly related to the OR operation in a way that ensures the maximum XOR will be found through this method.
- **Lack of Exhaustive Search**: The program does not perform an exhaustive search or use a more systematic approach to find the maximum XOR, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that it will find the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
