The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all data is written to the standard output. This does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is the last response received (response to the query when `i` was `n-1`), `i` is 1**.
