The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `v1` (which is `i` from the previous iteration), `n` is greater than 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, and the value of `v2` depends on the condition `r == '<'`.

Since `i` was the loop variable in the previous iteration, it has been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, and `v2` is `i + 1` if `r` is equal to '<'. Otherwise, `v2` remains `i + 1` and there is no change to other variables, `i` is `i + 1`**
