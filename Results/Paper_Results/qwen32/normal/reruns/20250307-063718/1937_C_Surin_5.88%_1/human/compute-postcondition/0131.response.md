Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2 (This value is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation).
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` (This value is also not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation).
- `n` is greater than 1 (The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is known to be greater than 1).
- `g` is 0 (This value is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation).
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0 (The exact value of `v1` is not provided, but based on the description, it could be 0 or any value from 1 to `n-1`).
- `v2` is `n-1` (This value is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation).
- `prev` is 0 (This value is used in the print statement).
- `r` is the last response received (response to the query when `i` was `n-1`) (This value is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation).
- `i` is 1 (This value is used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Explanation:
- `v1` can be either 0 or any value from 1 to `n-1`, but without a specific value given, we can only describe it as `v1`.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

Thus, the print statement will output the formatted string with these values.

### Output:
Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] 0 (where [v1] is the highest i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '<', otherwise 0)**
