You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of p, and must eventually output "! i j" to identify a pair of indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: kp is equal to the total number of test cases minus one, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` for the current test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the element in `p` that has the highest value, `v2` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop, `prev` is the index of the element in `p` that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, gives the maximum value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any explicit parameters. It interacts with the user to query a permutation of integers and determine a pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices. The function outputs the pair of indices in the format "! i j".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
