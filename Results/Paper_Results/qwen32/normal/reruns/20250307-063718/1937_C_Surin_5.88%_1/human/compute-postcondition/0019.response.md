The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v1` was `i + 1` and `v2` was `i`. After the assignment, `v1` will have the same value as `v2`, which is `i`.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is the user input.**
