The code snippet `r = input('')` reads a new input and assigns it to the variable `r`. This input can be any string, but based on the initial state and the context, it is expected to be either `'<'` or `'>'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received (which is now the new input), and `i` is 2.**
