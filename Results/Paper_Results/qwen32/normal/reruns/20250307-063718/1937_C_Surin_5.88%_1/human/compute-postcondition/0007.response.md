The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. However, the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for `v2` based on the given information. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**
