The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently 1, it should be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration of the loop. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop and has not changed from the previous iteration.

State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, and `i` is 2**
