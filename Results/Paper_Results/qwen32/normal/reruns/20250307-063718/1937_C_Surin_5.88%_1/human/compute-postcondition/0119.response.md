Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received (which is now the new input), and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
