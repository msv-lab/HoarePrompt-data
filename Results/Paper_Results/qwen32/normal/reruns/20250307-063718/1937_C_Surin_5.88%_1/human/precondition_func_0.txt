There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of p, and must eventually output "! i j" to identify a pair of indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
