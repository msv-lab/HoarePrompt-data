The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given the initial state, `v2` was previously set to `n-1`. After the execution of this line, `v2` will hold the value of `i`.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`**. 

In simpler terms: The value of `v2` has been updated to the value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.
