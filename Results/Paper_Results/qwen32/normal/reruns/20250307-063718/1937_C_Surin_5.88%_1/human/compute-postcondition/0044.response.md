To determine the output of the print statement, we need to understand the state of the variables involved at the time the print statement is executed.

Given the initial state:
- `kp` is 0.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the new input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the variables:
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. This means `v1` is a specific integer determined by the previous responses.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, the exact value of `i` is not provided, so we will denote it as `i`.
- `prev` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `prev` is not defined, it will raise a `NameError` if the code is executed as is. But based on the context, it is likely that `prev` is a variable that holds some previous value, possibly related to the responses or indices used in the loop.

Since `prev` is not defined in the provided initial state, we will assume that `prev` is a variable that holds a value that is relevant to the context of the loop or the previous iterations. However, without an explicit value, we can denote it as `prev`.

Given the above, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest value of i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '<', i is the current value of i incremented by 1, and prev is a previously defined variable)**
