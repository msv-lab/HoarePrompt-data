The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 1, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received (which is now the new input), and `i` is 3**
