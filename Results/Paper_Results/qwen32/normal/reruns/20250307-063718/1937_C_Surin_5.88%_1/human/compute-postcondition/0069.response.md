Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to match the value of `v2`, which is 2. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
