Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`kp`** is set to 0.
2. The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this value is not directly used in the given code snippet.
3. **`n`** is greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
4. **`g`** is set to 0.
5. **`v1`** is set to `i + 1`.
6. **`v2`** is set to `i`.
7. **`i`** is set to `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Key Points to Consider:
- The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but we know that it is incremented by 1.
- `v1` is defined as `i + 1`.
- `v2` is defined as `i`.
- The print statement uses these variables in a formatted string.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is not initialized before the code snippet, we can assume it starts at 0 (a common default starting point for loop counters).
2. **Setting `v1` and `v2`**:
   - Initially, `i = 0`.
   - Therefore, `v1 = i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - And, `v2 = i = 0`.
3. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - After setting `v1` and `v2`, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i = 1`.
   - However, this increment does not affect the values of `v1` and `v2` used in the print statement because they were already set based on the previous value of `i`.

### Final Values:
- **`v1`** is 1.
- **`v2`** is 0.

### Output Calculation:
The print statement will output:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
Substituting the values:
```python
print(f'? 1 1 0 0')
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
