Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation: The value of `g` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as no other operations have been performed that would affect them.
