The code snippet provided initializes a variable `g` to 0. The values of `kp`, the number of test cases determined by `int(input())`, and `n` as an input integer remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0**.
