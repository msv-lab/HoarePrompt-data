Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 2, reflecting the assignment `v2 = i`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
