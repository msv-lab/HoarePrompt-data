Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `r` is `'>'`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, reflecting the assignment `prev = i`. All other variables retain their initial values.
