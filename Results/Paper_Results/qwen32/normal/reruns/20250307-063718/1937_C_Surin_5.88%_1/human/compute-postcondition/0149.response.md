To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information:

1. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. For each iteration, it prints a query and reads a response.
3. If the response (`r`) is `'>'`, it updates `prev` to the current `i`.
4. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer:
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `prev` is updated to `1` if `r` is `'>'`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `prev` is updated to `2` if `r` is `'>'`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `prev` is updated to `3` if `r` is `'>'`.

Following this pattern, after the last iteration (`i = n-1`), `prev` will be updated to `n-1` if `r` is `'>'`.

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:
- `kp` remains 2.
- The number of test cases remains determined by `int(input())`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v1` remains the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0.
- `v2` remains `n-1`.
- `prev` will be `n-1` if the last response (`r`) is `'>'`, otherwise it remains the last value it was updated to.
- `r` will be the last response received.
- `i` will be `n-1` (as the loop ends when `i` reaches `n-1`).

Output State: **kp is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`, otherwise it remains the last updated value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `prev` will be `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`, otherwise it will be the last value it was updated to during the loop. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state or as described in the problem.
