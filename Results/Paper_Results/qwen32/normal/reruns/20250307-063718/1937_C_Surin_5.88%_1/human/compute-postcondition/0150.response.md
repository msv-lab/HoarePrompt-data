To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `kp` is set to 2.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this value is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0. Since there is no information about any responses, `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is set to `n-1`.
- `prev` is set to `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`, otherwise it remains the last updated value. Since there is no information about any responses, `prev` is not explicitly set to `n-1`. Based on the provided state, `prev` is not mentioned to be updated, so it is not clear from the given information what its value should be. However, the problem statement does not give any other information to infer a different value for `prev`, so we'll consider the default behavior or the last mentioned value, which is `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`. Without any other information, we'll assume `prev` to be `n-1` as a reasonable default based on the provided logic.
- `r` is the last response received. Since there is no information about any responses, `r` is not explicitly set.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```
- `prev` is `n-1` (assuming the last response was `'>'` or it retains its default value).
- `v1` is 0 (no response `'<'` received).

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **! [n-1] 0 (where n is greater than 1)**
