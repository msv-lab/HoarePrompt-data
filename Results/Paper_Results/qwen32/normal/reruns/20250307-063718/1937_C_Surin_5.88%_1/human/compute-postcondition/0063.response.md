Postcondition: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `v2` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string. If `r` equals `'<'`, then `v1` and `v2` are updated to `i`.**
