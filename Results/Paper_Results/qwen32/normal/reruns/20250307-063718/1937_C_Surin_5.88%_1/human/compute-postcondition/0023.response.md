Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `i + 2`. This implies that `i` is being incremented by 2, but since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only express `i` in terms of its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 1, but this information does not directly affect the print statement.
- `v2` is defined as `i + 2`. Given that `i` is already incremented by 2, `v2` is effectively `i + 4` from the original value of `i`.

The print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know the values of `v2` and `i` in terms of their previous values. However, `v1` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1`. We can only express the output in terms of `v1` and the current value of `i`.

Given that `v2` is `i + 2`, and `i` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value, `v2` is effectively `i + 4` from the original value of `i`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [i + 2] [i + 2] (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the current value of i after being incremented by 2)**
