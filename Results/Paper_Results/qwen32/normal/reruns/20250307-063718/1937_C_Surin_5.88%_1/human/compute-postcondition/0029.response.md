The code snippet provided initializes a variable `prev` to 0. None of the other variables (`kp`, the number of test cases, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **kp is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is unchanged, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**.
