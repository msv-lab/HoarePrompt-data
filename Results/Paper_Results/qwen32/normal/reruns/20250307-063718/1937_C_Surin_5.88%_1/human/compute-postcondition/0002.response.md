In the provided task, the loop is controlled by the variable `kp` and the range is determined by the integer `n` from the input. The loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the input.

Let's break down the loop and identify which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

1. **Variable `kp`**: This is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
2. **Range `int(input())`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is the number of test cases.

The state before the loop starts includes the integer `n` for each test case, but since the loop iterates over the number of test cases, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `kp`.

The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than the number of test cases, which is `int(input())`. Therefore, the initial state of `kp` should be 0, and the range should be set by the input.

State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`**

This state ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input.
