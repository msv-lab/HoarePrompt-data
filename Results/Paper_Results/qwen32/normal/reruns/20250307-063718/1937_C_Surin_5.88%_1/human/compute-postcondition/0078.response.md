To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and its behavior:

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration `i`, it sets `v2` to `i` and prints a query string. It then waits for input `r` which can be either `'<'` or `'>'`. If `r` is `'<'`, it updates `v1` to `i`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration (`i=1`), `v1` is updated to `1` if `r` is `'<'`.
- After the second iteration (`i=2`), `v1` is updated to `2` if `r` is `'<'`.
- After the third iteration (`i=3`), `v1` is updated to `3` if `r` is `'<'`.

This suggests that `v1` keeps getting updated to the current `i` value as long as the response `r` is `'<'`. If at any point `r` is `'>'`, `v1` will not be updated further, and the loop will continue to increment `v2` to the next `i` value.

After all iterations, `v2` will be `n-1` because the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`. The value of `v1` will be the highest `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If the response was never `'<'`, `v1` will remain `0`.

Let's summarize the final output state:
- `kp` remains `1`.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `g` remains `0`.
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `r` is the last response received, which could be either `'<'` or `'>'`.

Given this understanding, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received.**

In simpler terms: After the loop completes, `v1` will be the highest index where the response was `'<'`, `v2` will be `n-1`, and `prev` will track the highest index where the response was `'>'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
