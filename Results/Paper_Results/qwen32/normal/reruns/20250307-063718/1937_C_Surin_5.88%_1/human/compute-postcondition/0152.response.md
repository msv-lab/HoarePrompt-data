Output State: **kp is equal to the total number of test cases minus one, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` for the current test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the element in `p` that has the highest value, `v2` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop, `prev` is the index of the element in `p` that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, gives the maximum value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop.**

In natural language, this means that after all the test cases have been processed, `kp` will be the index of the last test case (one less than the total number of test cases). The variable `n` will hold the length of the permutation for the last test case processed. The variable `g` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `v1` will be the index of the element in the permutation `p` that has the highest value. The variable `v2` will be the last value of `i` from the inner loop, which is `n-1`. The variable `prev` will be the index of the element in `p` that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, results in the maximum possible XOR value. The variable `r` will hold the last response received from the comparison queries, and `i` will be `n-1` from the last iteration of the inner loop.
