To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it prints a query and reads a response `r`. If the response `r` is `'>'`, it updates `prev` to the current value of `i`. If `r` is not `'>'`, `prev` remains unchanged.

Given the output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- After the first iteration, `prev` is updated to `i` if `r` was `'>'`.
- After the second iteration, `prev` is updated again to `i` if `r` was `'>'`.
- After the third iteration, `prev` is updated to `i` if `r` was `'>'`.

This pattern continues for all iterations of the loop. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `prev` will be the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response `r` was `'>'`.

The values of `kp`, the number of test cases, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified in the loop body.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **kp is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is unchanged, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`.**

In simpler terms, `prev` will hold the highest index `i` where the response was `'>'`, and all other variables remain as they were initially except for `prev`.
