To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `kp` is 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but it is also not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `g` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no specific responses have been given, we don't have a specific value for `v1`, but it is defined as per the condition.
- `v2` is `n-1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`. Similarly, no specific responses have been given, so we don't have a specific value for `prev`, but it is defined as per the condition.
- `r` is the last response received, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is `n-1`, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Given the initial state, we know that `prev` and `v1` are defined based on the responses received during the execution of the program. Since the exact responses are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `prev` and `v1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of `prev` and `v1`.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the highest i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '>', and v1 is the highest i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '<')**
