### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized by using interactive queries. The logic of the program can be broken down into two main phases:

1. **Finding the index with the highest value (v1):**
   - The program iterates through the permutation and uses queries to find the index \( v1 \) with the highest value in the permutation. This is done by comparing the bitwise OR of the current highest value with each subsequent element.
   - The query `? v1 v1 v2 v2` is used to compare \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_{v2} \). If \( p_{v2} \) is greater, \( v1 \) is updated to \( v2 \).

2. **Finding the index that maximizes XOR with v1 (prev):**
   - After finding \( v1 \), the program iterates again to find the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - The query `? v1 i v1 prev` is used to compare the bitwise OR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) against the bitwise OR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_{prev} \). If the former is greater, \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

The goal is to use these queries to identify the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation. The program uses at most \( 2n - 2 \) queries per test case, which is well within the limit of \( 3n \) queries.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
2
4

<
=
>
2
```

**Execution:**

1. For the first test case with \( n = 4 \):

   - **Finding v1:**
     - Query `? 0 0 1 1` -> Response `<` -> \( v1 = 1 \)
     - Query `? 1 1 2 2` -> Response `=` -> \( v1 = 1 \) (no change)
     - Query `? 1 1 3 3` -> Response `>` -> \( v1 = 1 \) (no change)
   
   - **Finding prev:**
     - Query `? 1 1 1 0` -> Response `=` -> \( prev = 0 \) (no change)
     - Query `? 1 2 1 0` -> Response `=` -> \( prev = 2 \) (no change)
     - Query `? 1 3 1 2` -> Response `>` -> \( prev = 3 \)

   - Output: `! 3 1`

2. For the second test case with \( n = 2 \):

   - **Finding v1:**
     - Query `? 0 0 1 1` -> Response `=` -> \( v1 = 0 \) (no change)
   
   - **Finding prev:**
     - Query `? 0 1 0 0` -> Response `>` -> \( prev = 1 \)

   - Output: `! 1 0`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation within the allowed number of queries for the provided example. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the given example.

**Correctness: **True**
