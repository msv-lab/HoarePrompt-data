Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **kp**: Set to 1.
2. **Number of test cases**: Determined by `int(input())`, but this value is not used in the provided code snippet.
3. **n**: Must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not provided in the snippet.
4. **g**: Set to 0.
5. **v1**: Set to `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0. Since `r` is not provided, we assume `v1` remains 0.
6. **v2**: Set to 2.
7. **prev**: The highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`. Since no responses are given, `prev` is not set and remains undefined, but it doesn't affect `v1` or `v2` directly in this context.
8. **r**: The input string, but its value is not provided in the snippet.
9. **i**: Set to 2.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Variable Values:
- **v1**: As per the initial state, `v1` is 0 (since `r` is not provided and thus the condition `if r == '<'` is not met).
- **v2**: Set to 2.

### Output Calculation:
Given the values of `v1` and `v2`, the print statement will output:
```
? 0 0 2 2
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
