To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration:
- `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.
- A query is printed and the response is read.
- If the response is `'<'`, `v1` is updated to `v2` (which is `i`).

After the loop completes, `i` will have reached `n-1`, meaning the loop will have iterated `n-1` times. This means `v1` will hold the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `v1` will remain 0.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state of the variables can be described as follows:

- `kp` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- The number of test cases remains as determined by `int(input())` and is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit for the loop.
- `g` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `v1` will be the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `v1` will remain 0.
- `v2` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as it is set to `i` in the last iteration.

Output State: **kp is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is unchanged, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, and `v2` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `kp` and `g` stay the same, `n` stays the same, `v1` will be the last index where the response was `'<'`, and `v2` will be the last index the loop iterated over, which is `n-1`.
