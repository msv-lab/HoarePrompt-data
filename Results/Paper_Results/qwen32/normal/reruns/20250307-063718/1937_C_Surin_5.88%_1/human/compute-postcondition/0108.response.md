Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` (this value is not provided, but it does not affect the current print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (this value is also not provided, but it does not affect the current print statement).
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 1.
- `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'` (this value is not provided, but it does not affect the current print statement).
- `r` is the last response received (this value is not provided, but it does not affect the current print statement).
- `i` is 1 (this value is not used in the current print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Values of Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 1.

### Explanation:
The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The values of `v1` and `v2` are explicitly given in the initial state. Therefore, the string will be formatted with these values.

### Output:
The formatted string will be `? 0 0 1 1`.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
