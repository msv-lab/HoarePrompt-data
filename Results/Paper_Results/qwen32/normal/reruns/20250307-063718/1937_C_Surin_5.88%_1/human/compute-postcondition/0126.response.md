The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`. Given that `v2` is 3, `v1` will now be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `v2` is 3, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the new input, and `i` is 3.**
