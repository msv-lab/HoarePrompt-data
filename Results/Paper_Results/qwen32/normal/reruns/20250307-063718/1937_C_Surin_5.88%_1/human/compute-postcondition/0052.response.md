The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `kp` and the number of test cases, which is determined by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is unchanged, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`**
