The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split component into an integer, returning the list of integers. This function does not change the value of `n` or any other variable mentioned in the initial state. It simply sets up a way to read input for future operations.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of p, and must eventually output "! i j" to identify a pair of indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function `I` is defined to read and convert input into a list of integers.**
