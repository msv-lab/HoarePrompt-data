Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`, otherwise it remains the last updated value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state, so all variables retain their original values.
