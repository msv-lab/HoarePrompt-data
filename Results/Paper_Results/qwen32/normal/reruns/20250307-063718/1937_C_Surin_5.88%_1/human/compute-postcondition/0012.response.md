The code provided assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is equal to `i`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `v1` will now hold whatever value `v2` had, which is `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string, and `r` is equal to '<'.**
