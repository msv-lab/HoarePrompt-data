The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is a command that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. This command does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `i`, `n`, or `v2` are modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `v2` is `i + 2`**.

In natural language, this means that the value of `i` remains `i + 2`, the value of `n` remains greater than 1, and the value of `v2` remains `i + 2`.
