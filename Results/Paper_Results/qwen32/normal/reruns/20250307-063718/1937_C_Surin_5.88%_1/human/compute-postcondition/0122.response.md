Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 1, `v2` is 3, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received (which is now the new input), and `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, as it is now assigned the value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
