The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `kp` and the number of test cases, which is determined by `int(input())`. If `kp` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`**
