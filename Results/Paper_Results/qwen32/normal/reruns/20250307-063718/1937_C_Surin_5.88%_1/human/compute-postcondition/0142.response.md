Postcondition: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `r` is the new input value, `i` is 2.**
