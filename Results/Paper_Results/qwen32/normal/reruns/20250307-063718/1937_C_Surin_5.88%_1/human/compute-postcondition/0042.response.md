Postcondition: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
