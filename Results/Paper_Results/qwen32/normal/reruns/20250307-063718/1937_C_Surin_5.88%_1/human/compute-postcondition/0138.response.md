To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **kp**: Set to 2.
2. **Number of test cases**: Determined by `int(input())` but not relevant to the current print statement.
3. **n**: Greater than 2.
4. **g**: Set to 0.
5. **v1**: The highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0. Since no responses are mentioned in the initial state, `v1` is 0.
6. **v2**: Set to `n-1`.
7. **prev**: Set to 1 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, `prev` is 0.
8. **r**: The new input value, not specified in the initial state.
9. **i**: Set to 2.

### Analyzing the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Substituting the Variable Values:
- **v1**: As per the initial state, `v1` is 0.
- **i**: As per the initial state, `i` is 2.
- **prev**: As per the initial state, `prev` is 0.

### Constructing the Output:
Substituting these values into the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {0} {2} {0} {0}')
```
This will output:
```
? 0 2 0 0
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 2 0 0**
