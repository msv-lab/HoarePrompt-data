The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
sys.stdout.flush()
```

This line of code flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is immediately written to the standard output. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variable values change.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
