The value of `n` is reassigned based on the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state should reflect the new value of `n` while keeping the other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`**.
