The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` remains the same since it determines the upper limit of the range.

State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `r` is the new input value, `i` is 3**
