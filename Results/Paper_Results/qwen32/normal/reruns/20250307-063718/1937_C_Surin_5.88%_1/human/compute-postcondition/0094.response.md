To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the values of the variables `v1`, `i`, `prev`, and their relationships based on the initial state provided.

Here is the initial state:
- `kp` is 1.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` (not relevant for this specific print statement).
- `n` must be at least 2 (not explicitly given, but it's a constraint).
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no responses have been given yet, `v1` is not explicitly set to any value, but based on the logic, it could be 1 (the lowest possible value).
- `v2` is `n-1` (not used in this print statement).
- `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. Since no response `r` has been received yet, `prev` is 0.
- `r` is the last response received from `input()`. Since no response has been received, `r` is not set.
- `i` is 3.

Now, let's break down the print statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Given that `v1` is not explicitly set, and considering the context, `v1` is likely to be 1 (the lowest possible value it can take given the constraints). `i` is 3, and `prev` is 0 based on the initial state.

Substituting these values into the print statement:
- `v1` is 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is 0.

So, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 1 3 1 0**
