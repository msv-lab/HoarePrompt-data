The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `R` that reads an integer from the input. This lambda function does not affect any other variables or the state of the program directly. It simply provides a way to read an integer input.

Given the initial state, there are multiple test cases with each having an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p`. The function can ask up to `3n` queries to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of `p` and must eventually output a pair of indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`.

Since the lambda function `R` is defined but not used in the provided code snippet, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the definition of `R`.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}. The function can interactively ask up to `3n` queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`, and must eventually output "! i j" to identify a pair of indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function `R` is defined to read and convert input into a list of integers.**
