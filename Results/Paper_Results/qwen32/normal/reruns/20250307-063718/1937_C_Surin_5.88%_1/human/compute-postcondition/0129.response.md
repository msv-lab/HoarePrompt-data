The provided code snippet `prev = 0` directly assigns the value `0` to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is the last response received (response to the query when `i` was `n-1`), `i` is `n-1` (final value after the loop ends)**.

In simple terms, the variable `prev` has been set to `0`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
