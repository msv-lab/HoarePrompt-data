Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `v1`:** This is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. However, the problem statement does not specify what the response is or what values `i` takes, so we can only describe `v1` in terms of its definition.
2. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. It is not clear where `i` is coming from or what its value is. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can include it in the output as it is.
3. **Variable `prev`:** This is explicitly stated to be 0.

### Output:
Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
- `i` is an undefined variable in the given initial state.
- `prev` is 0.

The print statement will output a formatted string with these values.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the highest value of i (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was '<' and i is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**
