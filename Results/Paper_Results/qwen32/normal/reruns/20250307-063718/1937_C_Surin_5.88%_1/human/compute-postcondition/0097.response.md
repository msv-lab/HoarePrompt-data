The code provided assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, `prev` will be updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 3, `r` is the last response received from `input()`, `i` is 3**.
