Postcondition: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `r` is the last response received from `input()`, `i` is 2.**
