The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console immediately. This operation does not affect any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `r`, `i`) are modified by this function call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, `i` is 2**.
