The value of `v1` is assigned the value of `v2`. Since `v2` is `i + 2`, `v1` also becomes `i + 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `v2` is `i + 2`, `v1` is `i + 2`, `r` is an input string.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `v2` is `i + 2`, `v1` is `i + 2`, `r` is an input string.**
