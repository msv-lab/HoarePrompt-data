To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `for i in range(1, n):`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` contains at least one value, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, 1)` is an empty range.

The state of `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head. The number of test cases determined by `int(input())` is also not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly in this context.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**
