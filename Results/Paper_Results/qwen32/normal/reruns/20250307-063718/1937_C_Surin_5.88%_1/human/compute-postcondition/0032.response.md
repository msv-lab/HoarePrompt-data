The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not change the values of any variables or alter the state of the program in terms of variable values or conditions.

Given this, the variables `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` retain their initial values. The number of test cases is still determined by `int(input())`, and the conditions on `n`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**.
