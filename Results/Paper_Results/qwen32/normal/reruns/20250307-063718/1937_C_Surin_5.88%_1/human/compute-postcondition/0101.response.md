Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` command does not change any of the variable values; it simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
