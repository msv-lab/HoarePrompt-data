To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to evaluate the values of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `kp` is 1.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this value is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no responses have been given yet, `v1` is not explicitly set to any value, but based on typical initialization in such scenarios, `v1` is often initialized to 1.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.
- `r` is the last response received, but no response has been given yet.
- `i` is 1.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's determine the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`:
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no responses have been given, `v1` is typically initialized to 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- `v1` = 1 (assuming typical initialization)
- `i` = 1
- `prev` = 0

### Constructing the Output:
The formatted string will be:
```
? 1 1 1 0
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 1 1 0**
