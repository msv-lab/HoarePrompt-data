Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is the last response received, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not change any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
