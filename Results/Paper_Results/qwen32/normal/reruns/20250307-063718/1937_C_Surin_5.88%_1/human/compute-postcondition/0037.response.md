To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `kp` is 0
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0
- `r` is the input string

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value from the range `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same since it determines the upper limit of the loop.
- Other variables (`kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration.

Given that `i` was some value `x` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
