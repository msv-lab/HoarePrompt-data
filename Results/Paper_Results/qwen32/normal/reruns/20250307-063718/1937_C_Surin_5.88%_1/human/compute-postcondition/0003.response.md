The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `kp` remains unchanged. The number of test cases, which is determined by `int(input())`, is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer**
