The code snippet `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, and `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
