To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
1. `kp` is 0.
2. The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this does not affect the current print statement.
3. `n` is unchanged, meaning it retains whatever value it had before.
4. `g` is 0.
5. `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
6. `v2` is `n-1`.
7. `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

### Explanation:
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.

Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` are not explicitly given in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

### Output:
The print statement will output the values of `prev` and `v1` as defined above. Since the exact values are not specified, we describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the highest value of i from 1 to n-1 for which the response was '>', and v1 is the highest value of i from 1 to n-1 for which the response was '<')**
