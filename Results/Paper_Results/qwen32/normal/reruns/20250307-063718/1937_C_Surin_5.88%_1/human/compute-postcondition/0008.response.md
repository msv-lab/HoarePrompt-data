Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this does not affect the current print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but this is a condition and does not directly influence the variables in the print statement.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so we need to infer its value or consider it as it is.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly given as 0.
- `v2` is defined as `i`, but `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Since there is no additional information about `i`, we will consider `v2` as `i`.

### Output:
Given the information, the print statement will output:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i` (since `i` is not defined, we will keep it as `i`).

So, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i**
