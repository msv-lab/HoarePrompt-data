The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

The other variables (`kp`, the number of test cases, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and should not be modified in this step.

State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `v2` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, `i` is 2**
