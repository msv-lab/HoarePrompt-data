To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Summary:
- `kp` is 2.
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, but this does not affect the current print statement.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 2 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 1.
- `v2` is 3.
- `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`. However, `prev` is not used in the print statement.
- `r` is the last response received, which is now the new input. However, the value of `r` does not affect the current print statement directly.
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format a string.
- The values `{v1}`, `{v1}`, `{v2}`, and `{v2}` are inserted into the string.
- `v1` is determined based on the value of `r`. Since the value of `r` is not provided in the initial state, we need to consider both possible scenarios:
  - If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` is 2.
  - If `r` is not `'<'`, then `v1` is 1.
- `v2` is explicitly given as 3.

### Output Scenarios:
1. **If `r` is `'<'`**:
   - `v1` will be 2.
   - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.

2. **If `r` is not `'<'`**:
   - `v1` will be 1.
   - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 3 3`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we cannot determine with certainty whether `v1` is 1 or 2. However, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `r`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] 3 3 (where v1 is 2 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1)**
