Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **kp**: Set to 2.
2. **Number of test cases**: Determined by `int(input())`, but this does not affect the current print statement.
3. **n**: Must be greater than 1.
4. **g**: Set to 0.
5. **v1**: Set to 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise set to 0. Since `r` is not explicitly defined, we assume it is not `'<'` based on the provided information. Therefore, `v1` is 0.
6. **v2**: Set to 2.
7. **prev**: The highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`. Since there is no response provided in the initial state, `prev` is not explicitly defined. However, this does not affect the current print statement.
8. **r**: The last response received. Since there is no response provided in the initial state, `r` is not explicitly defined. However, this does not affect the current print statement.
9. **i**: Set to 2.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
Based on the initial state:
- `v1` is 0 (since `r` is not `'<'`).
- `v2` is 2.

### Substituting Values:
The print statement will substitute the values of `v1` and `v2` into the formatted string:
- `v1` will be replaced with 0.
- `v2` will be replaced with 2.

### Final Output:
The formatted string will be:
```
? 0 0 2 2
```

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `? 0 0 2 2`.

Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
