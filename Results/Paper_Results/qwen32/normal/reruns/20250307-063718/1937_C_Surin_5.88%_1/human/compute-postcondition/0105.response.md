Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
