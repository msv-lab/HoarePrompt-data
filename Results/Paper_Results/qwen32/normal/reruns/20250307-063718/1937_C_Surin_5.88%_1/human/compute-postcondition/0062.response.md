The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is `i`, but the specific value of `i` is not provided. However, we know that `v1` will now hold the same value as `v2`.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, and `r` equals `'<'`**.
