Let's analyze the initial state and the given print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` must be at least 2 (We don't have an explicit value for `n`, but we know it's at least 2).
- `g` is 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no responses have been given yet, `v1` is not explicitly set to any value. However, based on typical initialization in such problems, `v1` is often initialized to 1.
- `v2` is `n-1` (The exact value of `v2` cannot be determined without knowing `n`, but we know it is `n-1`).
- `prev` is 1 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. Since no responses have been given yet, `r` is not defined, and thus `prev` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is the last response received (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `i` is 2 (This variable is explicitly set to 2).

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1`: As mentioned, `v1` is typically initialized to 1 if no responses have been given yet.
- `i`: The value of `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `prev`: Since no responses have been given, `prev` is initialized to 0.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output:
```
? 1 2 1 0
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **? 1 2 1 0**
