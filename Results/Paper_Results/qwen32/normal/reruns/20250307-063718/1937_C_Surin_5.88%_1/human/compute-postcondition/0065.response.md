The given Python code snippet only modifies the value of `v2`. According to the initial state, `v2` is initially set to `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise it remains `i`. However, the code snippet directly assigns the value of `i` to `v2`, regardless of the condition involving `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `v2` will be updated to 2.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `v2` is 2, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the input string, `i` is 2**
