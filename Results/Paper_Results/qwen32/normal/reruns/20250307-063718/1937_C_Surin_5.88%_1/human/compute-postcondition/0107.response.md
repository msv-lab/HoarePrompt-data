The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `v2` will be updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is 1**.
