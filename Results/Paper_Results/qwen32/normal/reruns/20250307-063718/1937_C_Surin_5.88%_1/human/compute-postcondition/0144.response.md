Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the given print statement).
- The number of test cases is determined by `int(input())` (though this variable is not used in the given print statement).
- `n` is greater than 2 (though the exact value is not given, it is irrelevant to the current print statement).
- `g` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the given print statement).
- `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0. Since we don't have any prior responses, we assume `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `n-1` (though this variable is not used in the given print statement).
- `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. Since `r` is not defined or given, we assume `prev` is 0.
- `r` is the new input value (though this variable is not used in the given print statement).
- `i` is 3.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `v1` is 0 again.
- `prev` is 0.

Thus, the print statement will output:
```
? 0 3 0 0
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 3 0 0**
