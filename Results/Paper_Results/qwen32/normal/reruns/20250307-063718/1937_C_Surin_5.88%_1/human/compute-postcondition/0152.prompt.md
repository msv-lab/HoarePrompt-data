Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}. The function can interactively ask up to `3n` queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`, and must eventually output "! i j" to identify a pair of indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function `R` is defined to read and convert input into a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: kp is 0, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is unchanged, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kp` is 1, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'>'`, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `kp` is 2, the number of test cases is determined by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, otherwise 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if the last response was `'>'`, otherwise it remains the last updated value, `r` is the last response received, `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
