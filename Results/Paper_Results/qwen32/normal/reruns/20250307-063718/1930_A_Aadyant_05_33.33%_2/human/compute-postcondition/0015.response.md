The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 * i` equals 4. Therefore, the integer value of `list1[4]` is appended to `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, and `list1[4]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `b` is the input string, `i` is 2**.
