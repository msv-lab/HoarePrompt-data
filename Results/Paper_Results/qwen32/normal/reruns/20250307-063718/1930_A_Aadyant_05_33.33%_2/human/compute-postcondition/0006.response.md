The variable `a` is converted from a string to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `num`, `out`, `list2`, and `list1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**
