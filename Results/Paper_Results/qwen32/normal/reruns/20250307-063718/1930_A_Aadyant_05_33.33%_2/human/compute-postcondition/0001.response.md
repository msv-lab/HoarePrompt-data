Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7; `num` is a string equal to the input provided; `out` is an empty list.**

This means that the variable `out` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `num`) retain their initial values and constraints.
