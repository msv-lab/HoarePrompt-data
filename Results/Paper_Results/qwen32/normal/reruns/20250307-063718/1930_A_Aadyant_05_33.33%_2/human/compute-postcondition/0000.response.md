The code provided is:
```
num = input()
```

This line of code takes input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The input received by `num` will be a string, as the `input()` function in Python returns a string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7; `num` is a string equal to the input provided.**
