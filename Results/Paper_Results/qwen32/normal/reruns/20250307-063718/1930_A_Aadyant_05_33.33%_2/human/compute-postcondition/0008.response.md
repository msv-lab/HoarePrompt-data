The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` takes the string `b` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `list1` will now contain the words or numbers from the string `b` as separate elements.

Given that `b` is the input string, the specific contents of `list1` will depend on the value of `b`. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of substrings from the input string `b`, `b` is the input string.**
