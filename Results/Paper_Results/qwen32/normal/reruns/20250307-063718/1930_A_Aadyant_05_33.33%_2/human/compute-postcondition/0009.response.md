The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `out`, `list2`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `b` is the input string.**
