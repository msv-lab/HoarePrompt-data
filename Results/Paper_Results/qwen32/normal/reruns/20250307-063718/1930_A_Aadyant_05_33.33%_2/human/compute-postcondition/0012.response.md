The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `a` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[0]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `b` is the input string, `i` is 1**
