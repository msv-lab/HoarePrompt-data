The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `list2`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, or `out`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of `list2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list containing 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list.**
