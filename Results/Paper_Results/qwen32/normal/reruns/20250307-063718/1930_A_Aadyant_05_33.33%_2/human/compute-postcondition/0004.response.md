The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `list1`. None of the other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `out`, and `list2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list containing 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**
