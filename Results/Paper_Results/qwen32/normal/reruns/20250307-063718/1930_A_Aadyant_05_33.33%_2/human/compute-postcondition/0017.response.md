The code snippet `out.append(sum(list2))` calculates the sum of the elements in `list2` and appends this sum to the `out` list. Since `out` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `out` will contain one element, which is the sum of `list2`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `b`, `list1`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is a list containing the sum of `list2`, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, ..., `list1[2*(a-1)]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `b` is the input string, `i` is `a-1`.**
