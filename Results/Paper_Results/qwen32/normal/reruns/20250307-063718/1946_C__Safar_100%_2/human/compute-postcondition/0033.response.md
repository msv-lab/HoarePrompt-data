Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, which is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing an edge between two vertices in the tree. The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which could be a specific structure or value indicating the new state of the tree or a result of some computation based on the modification.**
