Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` if `node == p`, otherwise `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the previously processed `node`.**
