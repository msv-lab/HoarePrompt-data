The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state, the value of `node` is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned that `node` is not equal to `p`. The value of `x` is `1`.

After executing the code, the `stack` will have an additional element, which is the tuple `(node, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is not equal to `p`.**
