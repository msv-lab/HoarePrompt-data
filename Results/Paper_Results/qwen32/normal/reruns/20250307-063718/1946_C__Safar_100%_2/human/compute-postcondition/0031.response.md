The given loop is a binary search algorithm that adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on the result of the `check(mid)` function. The loop continues until `l` is greater than `r`. 

The output state after all executions of the loop will be when `l` is equal to `r + 1`. At this point, the binary search has narrowed down the range to a single value or determined that no valid `mid` exists that satisfies the condition `check(mid) == True`.

Given the initial state and the way the loop modifies `l` and `r`, the output state will be:

- `l` will be `r + 1`.
- `r` will be the last value it was set to before exiting the loop.
- `mid` will be the last calculated midpoint value in the last iteration of the loop.
- `c` and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

The final value of `r` will be the largest value for which `check(mid)` returned `True`, or the smallest value for which `check(mid)` returned `False` minus one, depending on the last iteration's outcome.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **`l` is `r + 1`, `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `c` is 0, `g` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the loop will terminate with `l` being one more than `r`, and `r` will hold the largest value for which `check(mid)` was `True` (or the smallest `False` minus one), while `mid` will be the midpoint value from the last iteration, and other variables like `c` and `g` will remain as they were initially.
