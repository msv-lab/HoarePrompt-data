The code snippet `d[p] += d[x]` adds the value of `d[x]` to `d[p]`. Given the initial state, `d[x]` is `d[1]` which is `1`, and `d[p]` is also `d[1]` which is `1`. After the operation, `d[1]` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`.

The only change is in the dictionary `d` where `d[1]` is now `2`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 2}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`**.
