Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. It computes and prints the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing exactly `k` edges from the tree.**
