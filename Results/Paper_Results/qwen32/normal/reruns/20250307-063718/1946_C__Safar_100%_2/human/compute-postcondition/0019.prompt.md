Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]` if `node == p`, otherwise `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is not equal to `p` if `stack` has been updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` if `node == p`, otherwise `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the previously processed `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least two adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]` if `node != p` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]` if `node == p`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the previously processed `node`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
