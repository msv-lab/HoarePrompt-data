Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`.**

In this output state, the `visited` set now includes the value `1`, indicating that the vertex `1` has been visited. All other variables retain their initial values.
