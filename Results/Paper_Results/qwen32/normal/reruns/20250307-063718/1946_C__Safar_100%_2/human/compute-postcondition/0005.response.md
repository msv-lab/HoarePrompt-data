The code snippet `x, p = stack[-1]` unpacks the last element of the `stack` list into two variables, `x` and `p`. Given that `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, the last element is `(1, 1)`. Therefore, `x` will be `1` and `p` will also be `1`.

The other variables (`A`, `g`, `k`, `visited`, `d`, and `r`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`**.
