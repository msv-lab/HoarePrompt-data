Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `x` is in the `visited` set. Additionally, since `x` equals `1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`.**
