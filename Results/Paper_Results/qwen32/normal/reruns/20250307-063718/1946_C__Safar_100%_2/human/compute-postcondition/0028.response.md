Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, then the current value of `d[x]` remains unchanged and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `d[x]` is updated to `2`.**
