The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` adds a tuple `(node, x)` to the end of the `stack` list. Given the initial state, `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the previously processed `node`, and `x` is `1`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the previously processed `node`.**

In natural language: The `stack` now includes an additional tuple `(node, 1)` at the end, making it `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
