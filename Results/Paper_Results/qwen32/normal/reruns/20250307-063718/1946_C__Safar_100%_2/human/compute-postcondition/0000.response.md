The code snippet initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. This does not affect the values of `A`, `g`, or `k`. The only change is the introduction of the `stack` variable.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`.**
