Output State: **A is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is `[]`, `visited` is an empty set (since `x` was removed from it), `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, then the current value of `d[x]` remains unchanged and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `d[x]` is updated to `2`.**

In natural language: The variable `x` (which is `1`) has been removed from the `visited` set, making it an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
