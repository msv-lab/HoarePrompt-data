To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `cnt` variable for each set of four integers (`a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`). The loop iterates based on the number of test cases `t`.

For each test case (each iteration of the loop):
1. It checks if all elements in the list `a` are odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1.
2. It then adds the integer division of each element in `a` by 2 to `cnt`.

The initial state consists of the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. However, these counts do not directly influence the computation of `cnt` in the loop. Instead, `cnt` is computed based on the values of `a` provided in each test case.

After all iterations, the final `cnt` will be the sum of:
- 1 for each test case where all elements in `a` are odd.
- The integer division of each element in `a` by 2 for all test cases.

Given the initial state does not affect the computation of `cnt` within the loop, the output state after all executions of the loop is solely dependent on the inputs provided in each test case.

To summarize, the output state is the final value of `cnt` after processing all test cases.

Let's calculate this in a generic manner and express it in the required format:

Output State: **the final value of `cnt` after processing all test cases.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the accumulated `cnt` value after all iterations based on the input values provided for each test case.

Since we don't have specific test cases provided, we can't compute a concrete number. However, the format of the output state after all iterations would be:

Output State: **final accumulated value of `cnt`.**

If you provide specific test cases, we can compute the exact final value of `cnt`. For now, the answer in the required format is:

Output State: **the final accumulated value of `cnt`.**
