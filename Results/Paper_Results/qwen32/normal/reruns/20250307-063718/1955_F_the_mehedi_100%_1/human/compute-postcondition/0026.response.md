To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variable `cnt` is calculated.

### Given Initial State:
1. `cnt` is the initial value (0 or 1) plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
2. `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input.

### Calculation of `cnt`:
- Let's denote the four integers in the list `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`.
- The floor division of each element in `a` by 2 is calculated as `a[0] // 2`, `a[1] // 2`, `a[2] // 2`, and `a[3] // 2`.
- The sum of these floor divisions is `a[0] // 2 + a[1] // 2 + a[2] // 2 + a[3] // 2`.
- `cnt` is then calculated as `initial_value + (a[0] // 2 + a[1] // 2 + a[2] // 2 + a[3] // 2)`, where `initial_value` is either 0 or 1.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of the integers in the list `a` and the `initial_value` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the value of `cnt` in terms of the provided information.

The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the `initial_value` (either 0 or 1) and the sum of the floor divisions of each element in the list `a` by 2.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the initial value (0 or 1) plus the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2)**
