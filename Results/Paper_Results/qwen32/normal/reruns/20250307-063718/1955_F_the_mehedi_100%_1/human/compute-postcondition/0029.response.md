The code snippet provided resets the value of `cnt` to 0. The initial state indicates that `cnt` was previously the initial value (0 or 1) plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. However, the code snippet explicitly sets `cnt` to 0, disregarding its previous value.

Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers derived from the input; `cnt` is 0.**
