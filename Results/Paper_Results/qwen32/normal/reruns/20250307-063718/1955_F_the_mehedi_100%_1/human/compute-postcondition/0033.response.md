The code snippet `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` increments the variable `cnt` by the floor division of `x` by 2. The values of `a`, `x`, and `cnt` are affected, but since the initial values of `x` and `cnt` are not provided, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

Given that `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, this list remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
