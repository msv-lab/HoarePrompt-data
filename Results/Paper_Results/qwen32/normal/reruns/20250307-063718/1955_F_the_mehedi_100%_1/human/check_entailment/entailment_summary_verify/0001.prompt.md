You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the counts and prints this value. The calculation involves checking if all counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd, and then adding half of each count (rounded down) to a cumulative total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Winning Condition:**
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

2. **XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is associative and commutative.

3. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Eve removes one number at a time.
   - Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins, which means she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

4. **Key Observations:**
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of an odd number of identical numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of numbers can be zero if the counts of numbers contributing to the XOR result in pairs that cancel each other out.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Logic for Bob's Wins:**
   - The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob can win once because removing one of each will make their counts even, leading to a XOR of zero.
   - The program then adds half the count of each number to `cnt`. This part of the logic is based on the idea that removing pairs of numbers will not change the XOR result, and thus, Bob can win for each pair removed.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the program correctly identifies that Bob can win once by removing one of each 1, 2, and 3 (though there is no 3 in this case, the logic still holds).
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, Bob can win once by removing one 1 and one 3.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, Bob can win three times by removing pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, Bob can win three times by removing pairs of 1s and 2s, and one 3 will remain, making it possible for Bob to win once more.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, Bob can win 12 times by removing pairs of 2s, 3s, and 4s.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. It handles the cases where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the given examples.
