The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `a`. According to the loop, `x` will take the value of the next element in the list `a` during each iteration. The variable `cnt` is mentioned as being increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` during the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, `cnt` does not need to be modified here.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last processed element of the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element to process. Therefore, `x` will now take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
