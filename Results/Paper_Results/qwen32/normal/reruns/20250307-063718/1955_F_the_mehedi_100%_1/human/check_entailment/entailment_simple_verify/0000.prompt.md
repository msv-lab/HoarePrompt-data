You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: the final accumulated value of `cnt`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

The problem is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The provided program seems to be counting the number of times Bob can win based on the parity (odd/even) of the counts of ones, twos, and threes, and also by counting the number of pairs of each number.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the code:
1. If the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, Bob can win at least once by removing one of each, leaving the XOR of the remaining numbers to be zero.
2. For each number type (ones, twos, threes, fours), the number of times Bob can win is incremented by the integer division of the count by 2 (i.e., the number of pairs).

However, this logic does not fully capture the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. Specifically, the code does not account for the presence of fours and how they can affect the XOR of the sequence. Here is a potential issue:

Consider the case where there are only fours:
- If there are an even number of fours, the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.
- If there are an odd number of fours, the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

The presence of fours should be considered in the overall XOR calculation, not just in pairs. The current code does not handle this correctly.

Let's consider an example:
- Input: `0 0 0 3`
- Expected Output: `1` (Bob wins if Eve removes one four, leaving two fours, which XOR to zero)
- Actual Output: `1` (The code correctly identifies that Bob can win once based on the pairs of fours)

However, let's consider another example:
- Input: `0 0 0 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (Bob wins if Eve removes two fours, leaving two fours, which XOR to zero, and then removes another pair of fours)
- Actual Output: `2` (The code correctly identifies that Bob can win twice based on the pairs of fours)

The code seems to handle the pairs of fours correctly, but it does not account for the initial parity of ones, twos, and threes in the presence of fours. For example, if there is one of each (one, two, three) and an even number of fours, Bob can win by removing one of each, leaving the fours to XOR to zero.

Let's consider a more complex example:
- Input: `1 1 1 4`
- Expected Output: `3` (Bob wins if Eve removes one of each (one, two, three), leaving the fours to XOR to zero, and then removes pairs of fours)
- Actual Output: `3` (The code correctly identifies that Bob can win three times)

However, the code does not handle the initial parity of ones, twos, and threes correctly in all cases, especially when there are fours involved. The code seems to be missing a more comprehensive strategy to handle the presence of fours and their interaction with the other numbers.

After careful analysis, it appears that the code does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly involving the presence of fours and their interaction with the other numbers.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully account for the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins, especially in cases involving the presence of fours and their interaction with ones, twos, and threes.
