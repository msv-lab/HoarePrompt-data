The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements of the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a` that haven't been iterated over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the second element in the list `a`, and `cnt` was increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should now be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`**
