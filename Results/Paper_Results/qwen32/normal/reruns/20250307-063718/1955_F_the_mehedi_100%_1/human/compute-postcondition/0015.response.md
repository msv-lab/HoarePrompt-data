The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial value of `cnt` is not affected by this operation, as the calculation involving `cnt` is done before the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `math.floor(a[0] / 2) + math.floor(a[1] / 2) + math.floor(a[2] / 2) + math.floor(a[3] / 2)`; `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input.**
