To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the calculation of `cnt` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `cnt` is initially incremented by the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2. Specifically:
  - `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`
  - `math.floor(a[1] / 2)`
  - `math.floor(a[2] / 2)`
  - `math.floor(a[3] / 2)`

### Calculation:
The value of `cnt` will be its initial value plus the sum of these floor divisions. Since the exact initial value of `cnt` is not provided, we can denote it as `initial_cnt`. The final value of `cnt` will be:

\[ \text{final\_cnt} = \text{initial\_cnt} + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{a[0]}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a[1]}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a[2]}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a[3]}{2} \right\rfloor \right) \]

### Output Description:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the final value of `cnt` after the above calculation.

Since the exact values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `initial_cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the initial value of cnt plus the sum of the floor division of each element in the list a by 2)**
