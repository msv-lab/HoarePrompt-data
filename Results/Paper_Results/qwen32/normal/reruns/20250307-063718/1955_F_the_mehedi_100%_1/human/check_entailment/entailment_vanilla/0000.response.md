To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Winning Condition:**
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

2. **XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is associative and commutative.

3. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Eve removes one number at a time.
   - Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins, which means she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

4. **Key Observations:**
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of an odd number of identical numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of numbers can be zero if the counts of numbers contributing to the XOR result in pairs that cancel each other out.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Logic for Bob's Wins:**
   - The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob can win once because removing one of each will make their counts even, leading to a XOR of zero.
   - The program then adds half the count of each number to `cnt`. This part of the logic is based on the idea that removing pairs of numbers will not change the XOR result, and thus, Bob can win for each pair removed.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the program correctly identifies that Bob can win once by removing one of each 1, 2, and 3 (though there is no 3 in this case, the logic still holds).
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, Bob can win once by removing one 1 and one 3.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, Bob can win three times by removing pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, Bob can win three times by removing pairs of 1s and 2s, and one 3 will remain, making it possible for Bob to win once more.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, Bob can win 12 times by removing pairs of 2s, 3s, and 4s.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. It handles the cases where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
