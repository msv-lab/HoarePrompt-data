Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases returned by `input()`, `a` is a list of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, where the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, `cnt` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
