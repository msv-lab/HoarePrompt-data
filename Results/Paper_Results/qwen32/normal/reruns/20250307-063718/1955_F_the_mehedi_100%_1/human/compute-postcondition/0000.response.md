In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer value that is obtained from the `input()` function. The loop variable `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not going to be used inside the loop body. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the integer value that `input()` returns.

Given that the loop is supposed to run for each test case, the integer value that `input()` returns should be the number of test cases, `t`. 

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The loop variable `_` does not need any specific state as it is not used inside the loop.
3. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the value returned by `input()`, which should be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the value returned by `input()` is the number of test cases `t`.

State: **Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) must be the value returned by `input()`.**
