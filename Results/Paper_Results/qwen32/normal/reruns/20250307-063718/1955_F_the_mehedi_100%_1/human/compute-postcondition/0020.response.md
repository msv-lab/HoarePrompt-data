The code attempts to execute `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)`. However, the variable `x` is not yet assigned a value, which means the code will raise a `NameError` because it tries to use an undefined variable. Since the code does not execute successfully due to this error, the values of `cnt` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is 0 or 1, `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, `x` is not yet assigned a value and a `NameError` is raised.**
