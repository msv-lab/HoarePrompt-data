The code snippet `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` increases the value of `cnt` by the integer division of `x` by 2. Given that `x` is the third element in the list `a`, and `cnt` was previously increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`, the new value of `cnt` will be `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input and `x` is the third element in the list `a`, the value of `x` remains unchanged. The value of `cnt` is updated to reflect the additional increment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` twice, `x` is the third element in the list `a`**.
