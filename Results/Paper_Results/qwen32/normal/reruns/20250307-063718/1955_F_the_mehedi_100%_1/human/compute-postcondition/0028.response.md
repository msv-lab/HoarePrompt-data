The code provided reads four integers from the input, converts them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `cnt` is calculated as the initial value (which is either 0 or 1) plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. Since the initial value of `cnt` is not explicitly provided in the code snippet, we will consider its initial value as part of the precondition and will not change it.

Given that `a` is updated by the input, the output state will reflect this change. The value of `cnt` will be recalculated based on the new list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers derived from the input; `cnt` is the initial value (0 or 1) plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.**
