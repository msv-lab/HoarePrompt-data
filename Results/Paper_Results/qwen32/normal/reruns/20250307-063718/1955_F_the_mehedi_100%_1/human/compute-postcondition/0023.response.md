The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`cnt` is either 0 + math.floor(x / 2) or 1 + math.floor(x / 2), `a` is a list of four integers derived from the input, `x` is the second element of `a`**
