The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is now ordered from the largest to the smallest integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
