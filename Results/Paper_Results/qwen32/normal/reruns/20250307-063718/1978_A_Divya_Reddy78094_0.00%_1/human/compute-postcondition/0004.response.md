The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `nums` is now a list of integers sorted from the largest to the smallest.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
