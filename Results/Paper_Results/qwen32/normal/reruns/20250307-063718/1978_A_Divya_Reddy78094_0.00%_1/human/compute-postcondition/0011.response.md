The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` represents the number of test cases left to process, and it decreases by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of test cases remaining, `n` is the input integer for the current test case, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order for the current test case. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` decreases by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one more than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 2 ≤ t ≤ 501; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
