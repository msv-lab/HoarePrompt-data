Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book.
3. It sorts the list of pages in descending order.
4. It outputs the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the maximum number of pages Alice can read by picking the two books with the most pages.

This approach ensures that Alice always picks the two books with the highest number of pages, maximizing the total number of pages she reads. The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.
