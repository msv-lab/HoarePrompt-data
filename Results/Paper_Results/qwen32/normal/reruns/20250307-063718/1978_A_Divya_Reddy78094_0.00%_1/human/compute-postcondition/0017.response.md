Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the total number of pages for each test case.**
