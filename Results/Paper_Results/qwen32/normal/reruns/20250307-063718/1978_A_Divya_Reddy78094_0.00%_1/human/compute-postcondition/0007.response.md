The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
