### Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by sorting the list of pages in each test case in descending order and then summing the two largest values. This approach ensures that Alice reads the books with the highest number of pages in each pile, which maximizes the total number of pages she can read.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books, `n`.
   - Then it reads the list of pages for each book, `nums`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in descending order. This places the largest number of pages at the beginning of the list.

3. **Summing the Two Largest Numbers**:
   - The program sums the first two elements of the sorted list (`nums[0]` and `nums[1]`), which are the two largest numbers. This sum represents the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

4. **Output**:
   - The sum is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2\n1 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The two books have 1 page each. The maximum pages Alice can read is 1 + 1 = 2.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4\n2 3 3 1`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The two largest numbers are 3 and 1. The maximum pages Alice can read is 3 + 1 = 4.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5\n2 2 3 2 2`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The two largest numbers are 3 and 2. The maximum pages Alice can read is 3 + 2 = 5.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `2\n10 3`
   - Output: `13`
   - Explanation: The two largest numbers are 10 and 3. The maximum pages Alice can read is 10 + 3 = 13.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The two largest numbers are 3 and 2. The maximum pages Alice can read is 3 + 2 = 5.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The output for all the provided test cases matches the expected results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
