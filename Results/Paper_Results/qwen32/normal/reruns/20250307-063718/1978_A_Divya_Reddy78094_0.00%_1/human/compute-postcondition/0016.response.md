Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; the loop has executed `t` times; for each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums` has been printed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing all `t` test cases. For each test case, an integer `n` was read, followed by a list of `n` integers which were sorted in descending order. The sum of the two largest numbers in this sorted list was then printed. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations as specified by `t`.
