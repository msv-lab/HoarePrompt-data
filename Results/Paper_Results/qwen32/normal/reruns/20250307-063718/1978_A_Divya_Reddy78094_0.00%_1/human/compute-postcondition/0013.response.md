The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state where `nums` was described as a list of integers sorted in descending order, the code snippet will replace `nums` with a new list of integers based on the input provided. The new `nums` will not necessarily be sorted in descending order unless the input happens to be sorted that way.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 501; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers based on the input provided.**
