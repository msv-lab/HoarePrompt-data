Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(2 \leq t \leq 501\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means that the first element of `nums` (`nums[0]`) is the largest element in the list, and the second element of `nums` (`nums[1]`) is the second largest element in the list.

Therefore, `nums[0] + nums[1]` will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest element and nums[1] is the second largest element in the sorted list `nums`)**
