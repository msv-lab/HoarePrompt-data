The code snippet provided updates the `nums` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then collecting these integers into a list. The initial state mentions that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, but this precondition is overwritten by the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers as provided by the input.**
