Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 501; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it will be updated to whatever integer value is provided by the user input. The other variables, `t` and `nums`, remain unchanged.
