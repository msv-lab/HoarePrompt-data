To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `nums[0]` is the first element of the list, which is the largest element since the list is sorted in descending order.
- `nums[1]` is the second element of the list, which is the second largest element since the list is sorted in descending order.
- The `print` statement outputs the sum of the first and second elements of the list `nums`.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of the largest and the second largest integers in the sorted list `nums`.

Output: **the sum of the largest and the second largest integers in the list `nums`**
