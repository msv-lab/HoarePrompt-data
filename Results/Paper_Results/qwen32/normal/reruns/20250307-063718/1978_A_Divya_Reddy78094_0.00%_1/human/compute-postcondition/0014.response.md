The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is now ordered from the largest to the smallest element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 2 ≤ t ≤ 501; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
