The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. No other variables are affected or initialized by this single line of code. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the new value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
