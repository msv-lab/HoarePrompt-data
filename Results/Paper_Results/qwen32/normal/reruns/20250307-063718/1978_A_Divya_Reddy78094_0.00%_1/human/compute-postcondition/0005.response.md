The `print(nums[0] + nums[1])` statement will print the sum of the first two elements in the `nums` list. Given that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `nums` list are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical sum. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the nums list)**
