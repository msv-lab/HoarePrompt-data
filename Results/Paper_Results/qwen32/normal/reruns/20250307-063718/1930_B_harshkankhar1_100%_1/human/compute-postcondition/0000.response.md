The code provided reads an integer `n` from the input and creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, the list `a` will be a permutation of the first `n` positive integers.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is read for each test case, and `a` is assigned a new list for each test case.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is the length of the permutation read from the input.**
