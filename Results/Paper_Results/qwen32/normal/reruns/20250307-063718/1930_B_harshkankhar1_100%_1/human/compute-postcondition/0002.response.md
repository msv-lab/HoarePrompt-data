To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, we need to understand the transformation applied to the list `a` as described in the initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
- The list `a` has elements at even indices reversed compared to their initial state.
- The elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Steps to Determine the Output:
1. Identify the elements at even indices and reverse them.
2. Keep the elements at odd indices as they are.
3. Combine these elements to form the final list `a`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this transformation.

Suppose the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

- Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`.
- Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are `[2, 4, 6]` and remain unchanged.
- Combining these, the transformed list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

### General Description:
Given the initial state, the list `a` will have its even-indexed elements reversed, while the odd-indexed elements will remain the same. The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the transformed list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output:
Based on the transformation rule and the structure of the list `a`, the output will be the elements of the list `a` after applying the transformation.

Output: **the elements of the list `a` after reversing the elements at even indices and keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged**.
