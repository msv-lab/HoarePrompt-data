You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p`. It then reverses the elements at even indices of the permutation while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged, and prints the modified permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (1 \(\leq\) \( i \), \( j \) < \( n \); \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
- The number of test cases \( t \) is provided first, followed by \( t \) lines, each containing a single integer \( n \) (3 \(\leq\) \( n \) \(\leq\) \( 10^5 \)).
- The solution should output a valid permutation for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Here is the code again for reference:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
```

### Checking the Correctness:
1. **Permutation Validity**: The program generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This is correct.
2. **Condition Check**: The program needs to ensure that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Let's analyze the generated permutation to see if it satisfies the condition:
- The permutation generated by reversing the elements at even indices is:
  - For \( n = 4 \), the permutation is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
  - For \( n = 5 \), the permutation is `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.
  - For \( n = 6 \), the permutation is `[1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.

We need to check if there exist any \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

  - \( (3, 2) \) and \( (2, 5) \): 3 does not divide 2.
- No such pair exists.

For \( n = 6 \):
- Permutation: `[1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2]`
- Checking pairs:
  - \( (1, 6) \) and \( (6, 3) \): 1 divides 6, but 6 does not divide 3.
  - \( (1, 6) \) and \( (6, 4) \): 1 divides 6, but 6 does not divide 4.

  - \( (1, 6) \) and \( (5, 2) \): 1 divides 6, but 5 does not divide 2.
  - \( (6, 3) \) and \( (3, 4) \): 6 does not divide 3.
  - \( (6, 4) \) and \( (3, 4) \): 6 does not divide 4.
  - \( (6, 4) \) and \( (4, 5) \): 6 does not divide 4.
  - \( (6, 4) \) and \( (5, 2) \): 6 does not divide 4.
  - \( (3, 4) \) and \( (4, 5) \): 3 does not divide 4.
  - \( (3, 4) \) and \( (5, 2) \): 3 does not divide 4.
  - \( (4, 5) \) and \( (5, 2) \): 4 does not divide 5.
- No such pair exists.

### Conclusion:
The program generates a permutation that satisfies the condition for the provided test cases. After analyzing multiple cases, no counterexample could be found where the generated permutation does not satisfy the condition.

Thus, the program is correct.
