The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements of the list `a` that are at even indices. 

To break it down:
- `a[::2]` selects all elements of `a` at even indices.
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

Given the initial state where `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the elements at even indices will be reversed in their order.

For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `a[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`, and reversing it would give `[5, 3, 1]`. Assigning this back to `a[::2]` would result in `a` becoming `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

So, the list `a` will have its elements at even indices reversed while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list where elements at even indices are reversed compared to the initial state, and elements at odd indices remain unchanged.**
