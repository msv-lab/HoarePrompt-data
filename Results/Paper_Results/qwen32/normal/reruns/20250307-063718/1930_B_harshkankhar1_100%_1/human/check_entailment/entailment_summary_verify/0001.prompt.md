You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p`. It then reverses the elements at even indices of the permutation while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged, and prints the modified permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the requirements and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)).

3. The output should be a valid permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it constructs a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices of the list of integers from 1 to \( n \).

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- `a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`: This creates a list containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
- `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`: This reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For \( n = 4 \):
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After reversing elements at even indices (0-based index): `[4, 2, 1, 3]`

For \( n = 3 \):
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After reversing elements at even indices (0-based index): `[3, 2, 1]`

### Verification:
1. **For \( n = 4 \) with permutation `[4, 2, 1, 3]`**:
   - Check pairs:
     - (4, 1) and (2, 3): 4 does not divide 1, and 2 does not divide 3.
     - (4, 2) and (1, 3): 4 does not divide 2, and 1 does not divide 3.
     - (4, 3) and (2, 1): 4 does not divide 3, and 2 does not divide 1.
     - (2, 1) and (3, 4): 2 does not divide 1, and 3 does not divide 4.
     - (2, 3) and (1, 4): 2 does not divide 3, and 1 does not divide 4.
     - (1, 3) and (2, 4): 1 does not divide 3, and 2 does not divide 4.
   - The permutation `[4, 2, 1, 3]` satisfies the conditions.

2. **For \( n = 3 \) with permutation `[3, 2, 1]`**:
   - Check pairs:
     - (3, 2) and (2, 1): 3 does not divide 2, and 2 does not divide 1.
     - (3, 1) and (2, 2): 3 does not divide 1, and 2 divides 2, but since \( i \neq j \), this pair is valid.
     - (2, 1) and (3, 3): 2 does not divide 1, and 3 divides 3, but since \( i \neq j \), this pair is valid.
   - The permutation `[3, 2, 1]` satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program generates permutations that satisfy the given conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
