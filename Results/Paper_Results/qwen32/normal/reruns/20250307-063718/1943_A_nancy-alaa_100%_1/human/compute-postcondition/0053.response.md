The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has just finished executing for that `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 1**
