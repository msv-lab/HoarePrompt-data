The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a` where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, we need to ensure that the input to the `range` function is at least 1.

Since the loop iterates `t` times (as per the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
