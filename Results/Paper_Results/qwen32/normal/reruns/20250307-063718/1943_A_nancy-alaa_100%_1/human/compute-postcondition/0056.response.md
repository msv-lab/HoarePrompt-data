Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking.**
