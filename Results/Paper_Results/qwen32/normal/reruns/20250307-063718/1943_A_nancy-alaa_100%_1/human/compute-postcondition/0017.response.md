To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `i` in `range(n + 1)`. 

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
- The loop iterates over `i` in `range(n + 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n + 1`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.**

However, since we do not know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it by saying `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`.**

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is 3, and it must be less than `n + 1`.**

But since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`.**
