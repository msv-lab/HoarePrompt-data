You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that either does not appear in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described in the problem statement. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, but it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` optimally.

Let's analyze the program and see why it is incorrect:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program tries to find the MEX by iterating through numbers from 0 to `n` and checking if they are present in the array `arr` using a `Counter`. However, this does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make choices to maximize and minimize the MEX respectively.

2. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice should try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that delay the appearance of smaller numbers, while Bob should try to minimize the MEX by choosing elements that force smaller numbers to appear earlier.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal strategy for both players. For example, in the first test case, the program simply finds the first missing number in the array `arr` without considering the order in which elements are chosen by Alice and Bob.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the first test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for the given test cases, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Output:**
```
4
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `4` because it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` optimally. The correct output should be `2` because Alice can force the MEX to be `2` by choosing elements strategically.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game as described in the problem statement and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
