Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `first` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is a boolean. If `first` is True and `mpp[i]` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is a boolean, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
