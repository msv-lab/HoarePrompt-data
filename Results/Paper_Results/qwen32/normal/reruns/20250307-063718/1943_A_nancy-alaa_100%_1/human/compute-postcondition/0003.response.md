The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements from the list `arr` and the values are the counts of those elements in `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `mpp` is newly defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.**
