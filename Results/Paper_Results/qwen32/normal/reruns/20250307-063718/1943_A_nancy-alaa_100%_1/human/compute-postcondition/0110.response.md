Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that either does not appear in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list.**
