Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`. If `first` is True and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `first` or any other variables.**
