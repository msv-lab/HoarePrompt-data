The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The initial state mentions conditions related to a loop and variables `i`, `first`, `mpp`, and `n`, but none of these are directly modified by the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, the loop breaks when `i` is the first integer not in `mpp.keys()` or the second integer in `mpp.keys()` with a frequency of 1, the value of `i` at this point is the output, the value of `first` is `True` if an integer with a frequency of 1 has been encountered at least once, otherwise `False`, the range has more iterations left to execute the loop one more time.**
