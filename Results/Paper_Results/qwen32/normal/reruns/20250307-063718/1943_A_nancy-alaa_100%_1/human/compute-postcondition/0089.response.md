The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The condition for breaking out of the loop does not affect the values of `i` and `n` directly; it only affects the control flow within the loop.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `i` must be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it defines the range of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.** 

However, since `i` is incremented, the specific condition `i` being a key in the dictionary `mpp` would need to be evaluated with the new value of `i`. Therefore, the state should reflect that `i` is incremented and does not make any assumption about whether it is a key in `mpp` without evaluating.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`.**
