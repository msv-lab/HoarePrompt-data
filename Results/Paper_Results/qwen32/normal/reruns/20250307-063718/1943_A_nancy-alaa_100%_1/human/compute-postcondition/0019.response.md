Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must still be less than `n + 1`. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
