The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The initial state mentions conditions related to a loop and a dictionary `mpp`, but these are not affected by the current code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; the loop will print the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is not a key in `mpp` or the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 after `first` has been set to `True`. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything. The loop will continue to iterate based on the range specified by the input.**
