Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will print the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is not a key in `mpp` or the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 after `first` has been set to `True`. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop breaks when `i` is the first integer not in `mpp.keys()` or the second integer in `mpp.keys()` with a frequency of 1. The value of `i` at this point is the output. The value of `first` is `True` if an integer with a frequency of 1 has been encountered at least once, otherwise `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: the value of `i` when the loop breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
