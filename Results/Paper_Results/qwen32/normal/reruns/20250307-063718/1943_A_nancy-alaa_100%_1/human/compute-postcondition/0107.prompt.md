Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, the loop breaks when `i` is the first integer not in `mpp.keys()` or the second integer in `mpp.keys()` with a frequency of 1, the value of `i` at this point is the output, the value of `first` is `False` if an integer with a frequency of 1 has not been encountered, otherwise `True`, the range has more iterations left to execute the loop one more time, `mpp` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged and the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `arr`, `n`, or `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
