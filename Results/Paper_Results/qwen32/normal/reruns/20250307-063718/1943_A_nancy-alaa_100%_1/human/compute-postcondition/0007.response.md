To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we need to determine the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not provide an explicit value for `i`. The only information we have is that `i` is not one of the keys in the `Counter` object `mpp`.

Since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it could be any value that is not present in `arr`. Without specific information about the value of `i`, we can only describe it as a value that is not a key in `mpp`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`, which is not one of the keys in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is not a key in mpp)**
