The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, or `i`. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement that it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement does not change the state of any variable.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, and `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.**
