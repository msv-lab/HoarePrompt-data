The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `first` to `False`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`) are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `first` is False.**
