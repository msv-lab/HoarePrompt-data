Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that represents the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean variable, and its current value is `True`.
- `i` is a key in `mpp` with a value of 1, meaning `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in `arr`.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is the integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **i (where i is the integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
