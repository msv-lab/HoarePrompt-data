To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `arr` is a list of integers, but its specific values are not provided.
- The variable `n` is a non-negative integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- The variable `i` is defined as `i + 1`. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value after the increment. All we know is that the printed value of `i` will be one more than its initial value.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(i)`. Given the information, we can only describe the output in terms of the initial value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` that will be printed is one more than its initial value. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of this relationship.

Output: **i (where i is the initial value of i incremented by 1)**
