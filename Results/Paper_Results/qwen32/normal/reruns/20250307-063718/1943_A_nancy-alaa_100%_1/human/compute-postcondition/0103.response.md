Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which exits the most internal loop or if statement. This affects the control flow but does not change the values of `arr`, `n`, or `i`. The value of `i` is already specified as `i + 2` in the initial state, and this remains unchanged.
