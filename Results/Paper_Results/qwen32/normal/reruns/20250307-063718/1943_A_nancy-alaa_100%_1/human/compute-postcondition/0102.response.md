Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer.
3. **`i`**: Initially defined as `i + 2`. This suggests that `i` is incremented by 2 before the print statement is executed.
4. **`mpp`**: A dictionary (implied by the use of `mpp.keys()`). The condition checks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is initially `i + 2`, meaning it is incremented by 2.
- The condition `if i is not in mpp.keys()` suggests that the print statement will only execute if `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- Since the exact values of `arr`, `n`, `i`, and `mpp` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` or whether it is a key in `mpp`. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the value of `i` as `i + 2`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i` which is `i + 2`, and this value is only printed if `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

Output: **i + 2 (where i + 2 is the incremented value of i and is a key in the dictionary mpp)**
