Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables `arr`, `n`, or `i`.
