To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the code snippet.

### Given Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers.
3. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. `first` is a boolean.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.
6. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement is executed.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i` after it has been incremented.
- The code checks if `i` is in the keys of `mpp`. If not, the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement. This means that the value of `i` printed must be a key in the `mpp` dictionary.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement, the value of `i` will be the next integer in the sequence starting from whatever its previous value was.
- The value of `i` printed must be a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`, which means `i` must be an integer that appears in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1, and this value must be a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is the incremented value of i and i is a key in the Counter object mpp)**

This output reflects the fact that `i` is incremented and then printed, and it must be a key in the `Counter` object `mpp` to avoid breaking the loop or if statement.
