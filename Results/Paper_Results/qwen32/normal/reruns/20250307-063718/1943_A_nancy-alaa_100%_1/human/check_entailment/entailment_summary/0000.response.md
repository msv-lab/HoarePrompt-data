### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the smallest integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that either does not appear in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the optimal play of the game by Alice and Bob, and therefore does not correctly determine the final score of the game.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Objective Misunderstanding**: The program incorrectly assumes that the smallest integer not appearing in the list or appearing exactly once will be the MEX after optimal play. However, the game involves strategic choices made by Alice and Bob, which affect the final composition of the array `c`.

2. **Game Dynamics Ignored**: The program does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it. The optimal strategy involves considering the frequency of each number and how it affects the MEX after each player's turn.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the program to determine the MEX is flawed. It does not consider the sequence of moves and the impact of each player's choice on the final MEX. For example, if a number appears an even number of times, both players can cancel each other out by picking that number alternately, and it won't affect the MEX.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly determine the MEX after optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
