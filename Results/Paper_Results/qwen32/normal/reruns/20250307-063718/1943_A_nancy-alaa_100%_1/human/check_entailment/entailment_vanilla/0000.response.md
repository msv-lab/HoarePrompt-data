Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (Alice) or simply removing them (Bob). The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the final array `c` when both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to include as many small numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including certain numbers.

### Strategy:
- The strategy involves counting the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
- If a number appears more than once, Alice can include it in `c` because Bob can always remove one of the duplicates.
- If a number appears exactly once, Alice will include it in `c` if it's her turn and no other number with a single occurrence has been included yet. This is because including such a number will increase the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n` to find the smallest number that either:
1. Does not appear in the array `a` (hence, it's the MEX).
2. Or appears exactly once and it's the first such number encountered (indicating that Alice can include it to increase the MEX).

### Issues in the Program:
The program does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy:
- The program does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
- It does not ensure that Alice includes the smallest number with a single occurrence only after Bob has had a chance to remove duplicates.
- The logic for determining the MEX based on the count of numbers is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the MEX when both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
