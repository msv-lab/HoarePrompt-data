Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is a boolean, and `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.**
