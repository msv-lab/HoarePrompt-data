The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `i` should now be set to `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration to reflect the increment that happens at the beginning of each loop iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 2`**
