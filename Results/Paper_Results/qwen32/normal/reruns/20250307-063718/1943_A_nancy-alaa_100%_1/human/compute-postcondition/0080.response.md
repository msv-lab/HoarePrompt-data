Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `arr`, `n`, and the condition about `i` not being a key in `mpp` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
