To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the variable `i` is used.

### Initial State Summary:
1. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers.
3. `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. `first` is a boolean.
5. `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

### Key Points:
- The variable `i` is described as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. This suggests that `i` is being incremented in a loop.
- Without the full context of the loop, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` at the point where `print(i)` is executed.
- However, based on the description, `i` is an integer that is incremented in each iteration of the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can say that `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration of a loop. Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration or the number of iterations that have occurred, we can only describe `i` in terms of its relationship to the previous iteration.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1)**
