Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1, and `first` is True. The state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `arr`, `n`, `i`, `mpp`, and `first` remain the same as in the initial state, and the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
