Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remains unchanged.**
