To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state:

1. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1.
4. `first` is True.
5. The state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.

The key piece of information here is that `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, while we know that `i` is a key in `mpp` with a specific value, we cannot determine the exact numerical or string value of `i` based on the given information.

Given this, the output will be the value of `i`, which is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1)**
