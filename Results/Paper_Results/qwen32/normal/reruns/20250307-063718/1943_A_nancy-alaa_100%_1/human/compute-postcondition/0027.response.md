To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step.

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). However, `t` is not directly used in the `print(i)` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. **Variable `n`**: This is at least 0. It represents the length of the list `arr`.

3. **List `arr`**: This is a list of integers. The specific elements of `arr` are not provided, but we know it has `n` elements.

4. **Counter Object `mpp`**: This is a Counter object where the keys are the unique elements from `arr`, and the values are their respective counts in `arr`.

5. **Variable `i`**: This is an integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`. This implies that `i` is an index that iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive of 0, exclusive of `n + 1`).

6. **Boolean Variable `first`**: This variable is set to True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise it retains its previous value. However, `first` is not used in the `print(i)` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

Given the above information, the `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i`. Since `i` is an integer that iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, the exact value of `i` at the time of execution will be printed.

However, since the specific value of `i` at the time of execution is not provided, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that iterates through the range from 0 to n, inclusive of 0, exclusive of n + 1)**
