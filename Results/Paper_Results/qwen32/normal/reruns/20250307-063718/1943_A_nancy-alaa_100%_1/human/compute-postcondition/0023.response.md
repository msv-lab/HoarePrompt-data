Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.**
