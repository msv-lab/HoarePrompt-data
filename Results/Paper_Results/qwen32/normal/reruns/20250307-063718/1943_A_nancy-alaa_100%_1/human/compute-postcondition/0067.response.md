Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is a boolean, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the loop or if statement is exited.
