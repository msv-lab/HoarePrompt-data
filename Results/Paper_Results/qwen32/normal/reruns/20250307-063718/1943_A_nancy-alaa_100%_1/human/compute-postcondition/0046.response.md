Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is False. The current value of `first` is True, and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a value of 1. The state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remains unchanged except for the current value of `first` and the condition that `mpp[i]` equals 1.**
