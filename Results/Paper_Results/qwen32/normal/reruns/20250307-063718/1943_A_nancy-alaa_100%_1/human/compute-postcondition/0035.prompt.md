Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `first` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`. If the current key `i` in `mpp` has a count of 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `first` or any other variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute; `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise it retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n + 1`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, `first` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` retains its previous value. If `mpp[i] == 1`, `first` is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
