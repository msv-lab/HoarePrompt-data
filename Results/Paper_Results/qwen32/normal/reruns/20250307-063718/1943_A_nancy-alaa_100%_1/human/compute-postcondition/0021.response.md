Let's break down the provided initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. `n` is at least 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `mpp` is a `Counter` object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
5. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`.
6. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is a variable that is being incremented and checked against the condition `i < n + 1`. The exact value of `i` at the point of the `print` statement depends on the previous iterations and the loop structure that contains the `print` statement. However, based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

- `i` is an integer that starts from some initial value (which is not explicitly mentioned but can be assumed to start from 0 or 1 based on typical loop initialization).
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the loop or if statement breaks.

### Determining the Output:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided at the point of the `print` statement and the loop structure is not fully described, we can only describe `i` in terms of the conditions it satisfies.

Given the information, `i` will be printed, and its value will be the current iteration value of the loop, which is less than `n + 1`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the loop will break before reaching that point, but if it is in `mpp.keys()`, it will be printed.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i` at the point the statement is executed, which is an integer less than `n + 1` and is a key in the `mpp` dictionary.

Output: **i (where i is the current iteration value of the loop, less than n + 1 and a key in the mpp dictionary)**
