To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer.
3. **`i`**: Initially, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
4. **`mpp`**: An implicit dictionary that is used to check if `i` is a key in it. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop or if statement breaks.

### Execution Context:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement is executed.
- The loop or if statement breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `i` and the contents of `mpp` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i` that will be printed.
- However, we know that `i` has been incremented by 1 before the print statement.
- The print statement will output the value of `i` at the point just before the loop or if statement potentially breaks.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is the current value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1, before any potential break condition is checked.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
