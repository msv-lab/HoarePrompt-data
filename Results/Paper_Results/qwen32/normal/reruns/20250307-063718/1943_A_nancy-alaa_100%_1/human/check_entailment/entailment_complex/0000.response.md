Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The program incorrectly identifies the smallest integer `i` that does not appear in the list `a` or appears exactly once, without considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

To solve the problem optimally, we need to understand the strategy of both players:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

The optimal strategy involves considering the frequency of each number in the array `a`:
1. Numbers with even frequency can be paired between Alice and Bob, and thus will not contribute to the MEX of `c`.
2. Numbers with odd frequency will contribute to the MEX of `c` because one of them will remain unpaired.

The MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer starting from 0 that is not in the list of numbers with odd frequency.

Here is the corrected approach:
1. Count the frequency of each number in `a`.
2. Identify numbers with odd frequency.
3. The MEX of `c` is the smallest integer that is not in this list of numbers with odd frequency.

The provided program does not follow this logic and hence is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
