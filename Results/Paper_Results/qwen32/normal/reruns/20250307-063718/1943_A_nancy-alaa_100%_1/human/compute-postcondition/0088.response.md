Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
