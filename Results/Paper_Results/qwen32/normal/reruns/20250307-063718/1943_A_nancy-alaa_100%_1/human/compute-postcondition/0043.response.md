Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer input that must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers.
3. `mpp` is a `Counter` object that represents the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. `first` is a boolean variable set to `False`.
5. `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is mentioned in the precondition, but its exact value is not provided. The only information we have is that `i` is not a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.
- Since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it means that the integer `i` does not appear in the list `arr` at all.
- The value of `i` can be any integer that is not present in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the exact value of `i` is not provided but we know it's not a key in `mpp`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer not present in the list `arr`)**
