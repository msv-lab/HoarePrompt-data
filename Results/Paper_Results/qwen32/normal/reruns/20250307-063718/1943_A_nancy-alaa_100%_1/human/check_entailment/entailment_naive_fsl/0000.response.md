Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described in the problem statement. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, but it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` optimally.

Let's analyze the program and see why it is incorrect:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program tries to find the MEX by iterating through numbers from 0 to `n` and checking if they are present in the array `arr` using a `Counter`. However, this does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make choices to maximize and minimize the MEX respectively.

2. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice should try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that delay the appearance of smaller numbers, while Bob should try to minimize the MEX by choosing elements that force smaller numbers to appear earlier.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal strategy for both players. For example, in the first test case, the program simply finds the first missing number in the array `arr` without considering the order in which elements are chosen by Alice and Bob.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the first test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for the given test cases, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Output:**
```
4
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `4` because it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` optimally. The correct output should be `2` because Alice can force the MEX to be `2` by choosing elements strategically.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game as described in the problem statement and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
