Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n + 1`. However, the initial value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `i` in terms of its relationship to the previous value and the condition it must satisfy.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, if its previous value was `x`, then its current value is `x + 1`. The condition that `i` must be less than `n + 1` means that the loop (or whatever mechanism is incrementing `i`) will continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Without knowing the exact previous value of `i`, we can only describe the printed value of `i` as the incremented value from its previous state, which must be less than `n + 1`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is the incremented value of `i` which must be less than `n + 1`.

Output: **i (where i is the incremented value from its previous state and is less than n + 1)**
