Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game and determine the final score based on the MEX of the array `c`.

Here's why the code is incorrect:
- The code attempts to determine the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the range `[0, n]` and checking if each integer is in the `Counter` object `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`.
- However, the code incorrectly assumes that if an integer `i` has a count of 1 in `mpp` and it's the first such integer, it should be printed. This logic does not align with the optimal strategy for the game.
- The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. This involves considering which elements to pick and when, but the code does not simulate this process.
- The correct approach involves understanding that Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`. The optimal play can be analyzed based on the parity of the counts of each number in the array and the number of turns left.

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal score based on the MEX of the array `c`. A correct implementation would need to simulate the game according to the rules and determine the MEX based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
