The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.
