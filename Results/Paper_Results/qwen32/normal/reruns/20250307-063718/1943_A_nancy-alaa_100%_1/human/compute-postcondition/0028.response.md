Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n + 1`, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise it retains its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `i`, and `first` remain the same as before, except that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
