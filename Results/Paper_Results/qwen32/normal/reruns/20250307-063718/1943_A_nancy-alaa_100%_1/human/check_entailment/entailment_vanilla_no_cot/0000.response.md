Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal game score based on the players' strategies. The program simply tries to find the MEX of the array `a` without considering the game dynamics where Alice and Bob are making optimal choices.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game considering the optimal strategies of both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. Here's a correct approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. Simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
3. Alice should always pick an element that helps maximize the MEX, while Bob should pick an element that minimizes the MEX.
4. Keep track of the elements added to the array `c` and determine the MEX after all elements are picked.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while i in arr:
        i += 1
    return i

def optimal_game_score(arr, n):
    from collections import Counter
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    c = []
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if mpp[i] > 0:
            if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
                c.append(i)
                mpp[i] -= 1
            else:  # Bob's turn
                mpp[i] -= 1
            turn = 1 - turn
    
    return mex(c)

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(optimal_game_score(arr, n))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This program correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
