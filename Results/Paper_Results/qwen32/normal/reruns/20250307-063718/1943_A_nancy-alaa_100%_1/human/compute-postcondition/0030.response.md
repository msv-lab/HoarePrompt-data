To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Key Information:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations but is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: At least 0. This variable likely represents the length of the list `arr`.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object that contains the counts of each unique element in `arr`.
5. **`i`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n + 1`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop breaks.
6. **`first`**: A boolean variable that is set to `True` if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise it retains its previous value. However, `first` is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Context and Execution:
- The variable `i` is incremented from its previous value and checked against the condition `i < n + 1`.
- The code snippet provided is a simple `print(i)`, which means it will print the current value of `i` at the point where this statement is executed.
- The exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value and how many times it has been incremented. However, we know that `i` is less than `n + 1` and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i` at the time of execution. The exact numerical value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but we know it will be an integer that satisfies the condition `0 < i < n + 1`.

Output: **i (where i is the current value of i, an integer such that 0 < i < n + 1)**
