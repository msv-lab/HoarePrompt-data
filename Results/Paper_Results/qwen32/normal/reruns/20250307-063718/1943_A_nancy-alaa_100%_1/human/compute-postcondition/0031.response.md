Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object with keys as unique elements from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n + 1`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `first` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
