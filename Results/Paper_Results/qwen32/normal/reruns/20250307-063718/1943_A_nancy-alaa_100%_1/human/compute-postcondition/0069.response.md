Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, and `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

Explanation: The value of `first` has been explicitly set to `True` by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code.
