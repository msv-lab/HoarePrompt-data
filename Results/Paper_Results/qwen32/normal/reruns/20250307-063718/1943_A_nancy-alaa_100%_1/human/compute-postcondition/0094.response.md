Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the condition that checks if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` and breaks the loop remains unchanged. The values of `arr` and `n` are not affected.
