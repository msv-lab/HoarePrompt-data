Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is False. The current value of `first` is False, and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a value of 1. The state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and the condition that `mpp[i]` equals 1 remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The value of `first` has been changed to False. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and the condition that `mpp[i]` equals 1 remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
