### Reasoning:

The original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` optimally. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem statement, the program's logic can be re-evaluated.

The program calculates the MEX of the array `arr` directly, which turns out to be the correct approach for this specific problem. Here's why:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n` to find the smallest number that is not in the array `arr`. This is indeed the definition of the MEX of the array `arr`.

2. **Game Simulation**: The key insight here is that the final MEX of the array `c` is determined by the initial elements in `arr`, regardless of the order in which Alice and Bob pick elements. This is because the MEX is defined based on the set of numbers present in the array, not the order in which they are added.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem states that Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX) while Bob wants to minimize it. However, the optimal strategy for both players, considering the MEX definition, is to simply consider the initial set of numbers in `arr`. The MEX of the final array `c` will be the same as the MEX of the initial array `arr` because the MEX is a function of the set of numbers present, not their order.

### Verification with Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call**: The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`.
- **Inside the function**:
  - `n` is read as the number of elements in the current test case.
  - `arr` is read as the list of integers for the current test case.
  - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
  - The program then iterates through numbers from `0` to `n` to find the smallest number not present in `arr` (i.e., the MEX).

The annotated code correctly identifies the smallest number not in `arr`, which is the MEX of the array `arr`. This is the final score of the game if both players play optimally, as the MEX is determined by the set of numbers present in `arr` and not by the order in which they are picked.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is the final score of the game when both players play optimally. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

**Final: True**
