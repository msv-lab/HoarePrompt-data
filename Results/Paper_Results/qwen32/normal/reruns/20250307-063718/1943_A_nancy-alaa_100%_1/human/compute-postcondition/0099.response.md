To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. The variable `arr` is a list of integers, but its specific contents are not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
2. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer, but its specific value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
3. The variable `i` is defined as `i + 2`. However, we do not know the initial value of `i` before this operation. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after the operation.

Given the information, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of its definition. Since `i` is defined as `i + 2`, it means that `i` is increased by 2 from its previous value. However, without the initial value of `i`, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the printed output.

Output: **i (where i is the initial value of i increased by 2)**
