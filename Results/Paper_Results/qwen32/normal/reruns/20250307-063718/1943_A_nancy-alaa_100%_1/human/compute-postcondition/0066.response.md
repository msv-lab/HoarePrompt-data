To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: An input integer that is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **`arr`**: A list of integers.
3. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. **`first`**: A boolean variable.
5. **`i`**: The value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is described as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- The loop or if statement breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`.
- Since the exact value of `i` and the state of `mpp` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `i` based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `i` will be the last integer that was a key in `mpp` before the loop or if statement broke out.
- If we assume the loop or if statement just broke, `i` would be the last key in `mpp`.

Given this understanding, the output will be the last key in the `mpp` Counter object before the loop or if statement broke.

Output: **i (where i is the last key in the `mpp` Counter object before the loop or if statement broke)**
