Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is a boolean, and `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
