To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the value of `i` or the output of the print statement. It seems to be a loop counter or some form of limit, but it is not used in the snippet provided.

2. **Variable `n`**: At least 0. This variable also does not directly affect the value of `i` or the output of the print statement. It might represent the length of the list `arr`, but this is not explicitly stated.

3. **List `arr`**: A list of integers. The elements of this list are used to populate the `mpp` Counter object.

4. **Counter `mpp`**: A Counter object created from the list `arr`. The keys of `mpp` are the unique elements from `arr`, and the values are the counts of these elements in `arr`.

5. **Variable `first`**: Boolean value `True`. This variable does not directly affect the value of `i` or the output of the print statement.

6. **Variable `i`**: A key in `mpp` with a count of 1. This means `i` is an element from the list `arr` that appears exactly once in `arr`.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will print a key from the `mpp` Counter object that has a count of 1. Since `i` is explicitly defined as such a key, the output will be one of the unique elements in `arr` that appears exactly once.

Since the exact elements of `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output one of the unique elements in `arr` that appears exactly once.

Output: **i (where i is a unique element in the list `arr` that appears exactly once)**
