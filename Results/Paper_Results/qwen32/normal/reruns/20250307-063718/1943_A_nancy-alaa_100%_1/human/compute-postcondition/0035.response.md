To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop are complete, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`. During each iteration, it checks if `i` is a key in `mpp`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and its count is 1, it checks the state of `first`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. The loop continues until one of these conditions is met or `i` reaches `n`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration, `i` was 0, and `first` was set to `True` if `mpp[0]` was 1.
2. After the second iteration, `i` was 1, and `first` was set to `True` if `mpp[1]` was 1.
3. After the third iteration, `i` was 2, and the loop either continued (if `mpp[2]` was not 1 or `first` was `False`) or broke out (if `mpp[2]` was 1 and `first` was `True`).

The loop will continue until `i` reaches a value that is not a key in `mpp` or until it finds a key `i` with a count of 1 when `first` is `True`.

The final output state will be determined by the first of these conditions that is met. Let's consider the possible outcomes:
- If `i` reaches `n + 1` without meeting either of the breaking conditions, the loop will complete all iterations without printing anything.
- If the loop breaks because `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it will print `i` and exit.
- If the loop breaks because `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is `True`, it will print `i` and exit.

Given the information, the loop will either print the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp` or the first integer `i` that is in `mpp` with a count of 1 after `first` has been set to `True`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `arr` and `mpp`, we can only describe the general final state.

Output State: **The loop will print the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is not a key in `mpp` or the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 after `first` has been set to `True`. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print the first missing integer or the first integer that appears exactly once after another integer that also appeared exactly once, or it will complete without printing if no such conditions are met.
