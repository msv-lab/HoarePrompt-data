The code snippet provided initializes a `Counter` object named `mpp` using the list `arr`. This `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is an input integer and `arr` is a list of integers. The `mpp` variable is now a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.**

In this output state, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. The new variable `mpp` is introduced and holds the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
