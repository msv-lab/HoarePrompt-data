The code provided is a simple `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
