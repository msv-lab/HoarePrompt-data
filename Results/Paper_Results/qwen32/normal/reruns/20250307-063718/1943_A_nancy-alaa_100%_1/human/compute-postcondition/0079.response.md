Given the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

The task is to determine what will be printed when the following statement executes:

```python
print(i)
```

Based on the precondition, we know the value of `i` but not its exact numeric value. The precondition only tells us that `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`. However, it does not provide any specific information about the value of `i` itself. Therefore, we can only state that `i` is some value that is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **i (where i is a value that is not a key in the dictionary mpp)**
