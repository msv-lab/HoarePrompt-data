Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged and the program continues without breaking.**
