Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the variables and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
- `favorite_value` is the value of `a[f - 1]`.
- `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order.
- `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
- The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `removed_count`, or `favorite_count`. The print statement is independent of these variables and will always print `'YES'` regardless of their values.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
