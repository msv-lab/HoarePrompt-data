Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then all occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` are within the first `k` elements. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is 0, then `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.**
