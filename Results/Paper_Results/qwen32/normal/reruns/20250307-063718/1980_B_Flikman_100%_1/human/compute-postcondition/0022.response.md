Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. The number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` (`removed_count`) is 0 and is not equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` (`favorite_count`).**
