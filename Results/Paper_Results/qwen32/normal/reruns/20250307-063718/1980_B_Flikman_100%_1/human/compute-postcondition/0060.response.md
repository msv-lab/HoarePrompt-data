Output State: **`t` is 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`.**

In this output state, the variable `removed_count` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial condition.
