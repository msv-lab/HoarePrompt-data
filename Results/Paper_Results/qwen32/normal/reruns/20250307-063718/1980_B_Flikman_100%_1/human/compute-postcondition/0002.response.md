The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 100, inclusive. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet.

After the execution of the code, the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated to the integers provided in the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.**
