Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will always be removed, never be removed, or may be either removed or left. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the provided code:

1. **Sorting the Cubes**: The program correctly sorts the cubes in non-increasing order of their values.
2. **Counting Removed Cubes**: The program counts how many cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed in the first `k` cubes.
3. **Determining the Output**:
   - If `removed_count == favorite_count`, the program prints "YES", implying all cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed. This is incorrect because it does not account for the position of the favorite cube within the sorted list.
   - If `removed_count == 0`, the program prints "NO", implying no cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "MAYBE", which is correct in some cases but not in all.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

**Explanation**:
- The favorite cube has a value of 3 (at index 2).
- After sorting, the cubes are `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The first 2 cubes removed are `[4, 3]`.
- The favorite cube could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 in the sorted list.
  - If the favorite cube is in position 2, it will be removed.
  - If the favorite cube is in position 3 or 4, it will not be removed.

The program will incorrectly print "YES" because `removed_count` (1) is not equal to `favorite_count` (3), and `removed_count` is not 0, so it defaults to "MAYBE". However, the correct answer should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed depending on its exact position.

To fix the program, we need to determine the exact position of the favorite cube in the sorted list and compare it to `k`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        favorite_position = sorted_a.index(favorite_value) + 1  # +1 to convert to 1-based index
        if favorite_position <= k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_position > k + sorted_a.count(favorite_value) - 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')

```

This corrected code properly checks the position of the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value to determine the correct output.
