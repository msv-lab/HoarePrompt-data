Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is set to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
- `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`.
- `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'MAYBE'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **MAYBE**
