The given code snippet increments the `removed_count` variable by 1. The initial state specifies that `removed_count` can be either 1 or 2 depending on whether the current element at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value` or not. Since `i` is 2, we do not need to determine the specific value of `removed_count` before the increment; we only need to add 1 to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, and `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order. `removed_count` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 2.**
