The code snippet provided sorts the list `a` in descending order and assigns the result to `sorted_a`. This affects the value of `sorted_a`, but does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `removed_count`, or `favorite_count`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of the new `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`.**
