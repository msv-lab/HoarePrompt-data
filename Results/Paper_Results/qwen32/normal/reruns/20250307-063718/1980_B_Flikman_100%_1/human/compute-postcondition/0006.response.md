Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, and `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order. `removed_count` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `removed_count` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, and `sorted_a`) retain their initial values as described.
