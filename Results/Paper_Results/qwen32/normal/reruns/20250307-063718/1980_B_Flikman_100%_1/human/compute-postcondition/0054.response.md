Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it means `favorite_value` appears the same number of times in the first `k` elements as it does in the entire `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is greater than 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` appears more times in the first `k` elements than in the rest of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0.**
