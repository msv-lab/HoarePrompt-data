Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the new integer value provided by the input; `n`, `f`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then all occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` are within the first `k` elements. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is 0, then `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it means `favorite_value` appears the same number of times in the first `k` elements as it does in the entire `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is greater than 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` appears more times in the first `k` elements than in the rest of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` remains equal to `favorite_count`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count` and if `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
