You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will always be removed, never be removed, or may be either removed or left. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the provided code:

1. **Sorting the Cubes**: The program correctly sorts the cubes in non-increasing order of their values.
2. **Counting Removed Cubes**: The program counts how many cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed in the first `k` cubes.
3. **Determining the Output**:
   - If `removed_count == favorite_count`, the program prints "YES", implying all cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed. This is incorrect because it does not account for the position of the favorite cube within the sorted list.
   - If `removed_count == 0`, the program prints "NO", implying no cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "MAYBE", which is correct in some cases but not in all.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

**Explanation**:
- The favorite cube has a value of 3 (at index 2).
- After sorting, the cubes are `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The first 2 cubes removed are `[4, 3]`.
- The favorite cube could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 in the sorted list.
  - If the favorite cube is in position 2, it will be removed.
  - If the favorite cube is in position 3 or 4, it will not be removed.

The program will incorrectly print "YES" because `removed_count` (1) is not equal to `favorite_count` (3), and `removed_count` is not 0, so it defaults to "MAYBE". However, the correct answer should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed depending on its exact position.

To fix the program, we need to determine the exact position of the favorite cube in the sorted list and compare it to `k`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        favorite_position = sorted_a.index(favorite_value) + 1  # +1 to convert to 1-based index
        if favorite_position <= k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_position > k + sorted_a.count(favorite_value) - 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')

```

This corrected code properly checks the position of the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value to determine the correct output.
