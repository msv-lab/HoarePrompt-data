Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` based on the new `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new `a` in descending order, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is incremented by 1. `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the new `sorted_a`.**
