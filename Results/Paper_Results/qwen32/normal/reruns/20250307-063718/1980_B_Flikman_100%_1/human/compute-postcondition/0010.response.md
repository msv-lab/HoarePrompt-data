Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, and `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order. If the current element at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 1; otherwise, `removed_count` remains 0. `i` is 0.**
