Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1.
- `n`, `f`, `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
- `favorite_value` is the value at index `f - 1` of the list `a`.
- `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a` in descending order.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a`.
- It is given that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state does not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not depend on any variables or conditions derived from the initial state. The `print` statement is static and will always output `'YES'`.

### Output:
Based on the given code snippet and the initial state, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
