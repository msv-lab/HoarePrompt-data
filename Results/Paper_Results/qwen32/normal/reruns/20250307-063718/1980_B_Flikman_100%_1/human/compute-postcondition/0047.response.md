Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: `t` is `t - 1`. This means `t` is updated to be one less than its previous value.
2. **n, f, k**: These are integers provided by the input.
3. **a**: This is a new list of integers derived from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
4. **favorite_value**: This is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
5. **sorted_a**: This is a sorted version of the list `a` in descending order.
6. **removed_count**: This is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
7. **favorite_count**: This is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire list `sorted_a`.
8. **Current State**: The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`.

### The Python Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The condition that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count` does not affect the output of the `print` statement. It only affects the logic that might lead to this point in the code, but the `print` statement itself is independent of these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
