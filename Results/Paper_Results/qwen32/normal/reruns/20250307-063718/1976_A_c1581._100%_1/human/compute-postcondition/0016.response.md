Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing for all characters in the `password` string, the `digits` list will have all the digit characters from the `password`, and the `letters` list will have all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`.
