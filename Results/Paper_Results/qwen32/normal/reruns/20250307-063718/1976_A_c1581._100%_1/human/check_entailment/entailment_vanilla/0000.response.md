Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - It separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (ensuring no digit comes after a letter).
   - It constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It compares `sortedPassword` with the original password to determine if the password is strong.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit can come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks the last digit against the first letter. It should ensure that no digit is followed by a letter anywhere in the password.
- The function `func_1` should also check if the letters are in non-decreasing order, but this is already handled by sorting the `letters` list and comparing the `sortedPassword` with the original password.

### Corrected Approach:
- The program should iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow.
- It should also ensure that both the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement that no digit can come after a letter. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
