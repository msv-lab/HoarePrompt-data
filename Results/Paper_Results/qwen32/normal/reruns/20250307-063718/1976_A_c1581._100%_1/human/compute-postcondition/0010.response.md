The code appends `char` to the `letters` list. Given the initial state, `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, so `letters` was initially an empty list. After appending `char`, `letters` will contain this lowercase Latin letter. The `digits` list remains unchanged as it was initially empty and the code does not modify it. The `password` string and the integer `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `char` is a lowercase Latin letter; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing the lowercase Latin letter `char`.**
