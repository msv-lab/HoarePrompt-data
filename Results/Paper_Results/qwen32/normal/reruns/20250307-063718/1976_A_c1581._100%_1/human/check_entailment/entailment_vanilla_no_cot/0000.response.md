Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly verifying the strength of the passwords according to the problem description:

1. **Sorting and Comparison Logic**: The function `func_1` sorts the digits and letters separately and then compares the entire sorted password with the original password. However, the problem requires that all letters come before all digits in the password, and both the letters and digits must be in non-decreasing order. The current logic does not ensure that all letters appear before any digits in the original password.

2. **Digit After Letter Check**: The function does not correctly check that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is not the correct way to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_digit = False
    prev_char = ''
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            seen_digit = True
            if prev_char.isdigit() and char < prev_char:
                return False
        else:
            if seen_digit:
                return False
            if prev_char.isalpha() and char < prev_char:
                return False
        
        prev_char = char
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- No digit comes after a letter.
- Digits are in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are in non-decreasing order.

So, the original program is incorrect.
