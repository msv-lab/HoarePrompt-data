Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `char` is the next character in `password` to be processed. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the lowercase Latin letter `char` and the newly appended `char`.**

Natural Language: The `letters` list now contains the `char` character appended to it. The `password`, `n`, and `char` remain unchanged. If `char` was a digit before, `digits` still contains `char` and `letters` is now a list with `char` as its only element. If `char` was a lowercase Latin letter before, `digits` remains an empty list and `letters` now contains all previous lowercase Latin letters from `password` plus the newly appended `char`.
