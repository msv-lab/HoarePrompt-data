Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
The given program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a password length and the password itself. It then checks each password using the `func_1` function and prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` is supposed to verify if a password meets the conditions specified in the problem description. According to the summary, it checks:
- If all digits come before letters.
- If digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the combined sorted string matches the input.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the function does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter. It suggests that the function might incorrectly return "YES" for some cases where digits appear after letters in the original string.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The function `func_1` does not explicitly check if a digit appears after a letter in the original password string. Instead, it checks if the combined sorted string matches the input password, which does not enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.
   
2. **Sorting and Matching:**
   - The function sorts the digits and letters separately and checks if the combined sorted string matches the input password. This is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The corrected version of the function provided in the original assessment explicitly checks that no digit appears after a letter by iterating through the password and setting a flag when a digit is encountered. If a letter is found after the flag is set, it returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The function only checks if the digits and letters are sorted individually and if the combined sorted string matches the input, which is not sufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.
