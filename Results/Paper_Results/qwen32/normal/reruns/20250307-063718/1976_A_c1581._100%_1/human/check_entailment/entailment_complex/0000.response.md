### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly verifies whether a password is strong based on the given conditions.

1. **Function `func_1(password)`**:
    - **Initialization**: Two lists, `digits` and `letters`, are initialized to store digits and letters from the password, respectively.
    - **Character Classification**: The function iterates through each character in the password. If the character is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list; otherwise, it is added to the `letters` list.
    - **Sorting**: Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    - **Condition Checks**:
        - The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This is redundant since the `digits` list is already sorted.
        - The function checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.
    - **Final Check**: The function constructs a `sortedPassword` string by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists. It then checks if this `sortedPassword` matches the original password. If it does, the password is considered strong, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Main Program Loop**:
    - The main loop reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
    - It then calls `func_1(password)` to determine if the password is strong and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly separates digits and letters and sorts them.
- The condition that no digit should come after a letter is correctly checked by ensuring that the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter.
- The final check ensures that the password is already sorted as required (digits before letters, both in non-decreasing order).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
