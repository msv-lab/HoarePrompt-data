The code snippet concatenates the `digits` and `letters` strings and assigns the result to `sortedPassword`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `digits` and `letters`, we will represent `sortedPassword` as the concatenation of these two variables.

Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations without returning False; `sortedPassword` is `digits + letters`.**
