Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `char` is the next character in `password` after the one that was just processed. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the character `char` has been appended to the `digits` list, regardless of whether `char` was originally a digit or a lowercase Latin letter. The `letters` list remains empty.
