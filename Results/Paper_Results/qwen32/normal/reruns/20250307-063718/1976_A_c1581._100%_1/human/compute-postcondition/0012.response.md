The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which is iterated over the string `password`. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the `password` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters.
- `char` is the next character in `password` after the one that was just processed.
- Depending on whether `char` is a digit or a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` or `letters` is updated accordingly.

For the next iteration of the loop, `char` should be the next character in the `password` string. Since the loop iterates over `password`, `char` will naturally be the next character in sequence.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `char` is the next character in `password` after the one that was just processed. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the lowercase Latin letter `char`.**

Since `char` is the loop variable, it will be updated automatically to the next character in `password` in the next iteration. Therefore, no explicit adjustment is needed for `char` itself, but we should ensure that `password` and the conditions around `char` are correctly described for the next iteration.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `char` is the next character in `password` to be processed. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the lowercase Latin letter `char`.**
