Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of exactly n characters where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. The function returns `True` if the password meets a specific condition (Case_7), and `False` in all other cases (Case_1 through Case_6 and Case_8).**
