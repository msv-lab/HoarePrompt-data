Let's systematically analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly verifies the strength of passwords according to the given problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - It separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order (which is redundant since the list is already sorted).
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (which is incorrect as it should ensure no digit comes after any letter).
   - It constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It compares `sortedPassword` with the original password to determine if the password is strong.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit can come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks the last digit against the first letter. It should ensure that no digit is followed by a letter anywhere in the password.
- The function `func_1` should also check if the letters are in non-decreasing order, but this is already handled by sorting the `letters` list and comparing the `sortedPassword` with the original password.

### Corrected Approach:
- The program should iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow.
- It should also ensure that both the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states:
- The function checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, both are in ascending order, and no digit is greater than any letter. It returns `True` if the password meets these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.

This summary is partially correct but misses the crucial point that no digit should come after any letter, not just the first letter.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the function, we need to ensure:
- Digits are in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are in non-decreasing order.
- No digit comes after any letter.

Here's a corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(password):
    saw_letter = False
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if saw_letter:
                return False
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            saw_letter = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the requirement that no digit can come after a letter. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
