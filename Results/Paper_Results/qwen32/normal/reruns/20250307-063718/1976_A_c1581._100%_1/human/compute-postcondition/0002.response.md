Now, let's analyze the given task step by step.

State before the loop starts: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for char in password:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the only variable in the loop head is `char`. The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string. The state of `password` is already given and does not need adjustment since it is defined as a string of length `n` with the specified conditions. The variables `digits` and `letters` are not part of the loop head and thus their states cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop iterates over `password`, the loop will execute if `password` has at least one character. Given that `password` is defined to have `n` characters where `1 <= n <= 20`, the loop will definitely execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The state of `password` is already sufficient.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list**
