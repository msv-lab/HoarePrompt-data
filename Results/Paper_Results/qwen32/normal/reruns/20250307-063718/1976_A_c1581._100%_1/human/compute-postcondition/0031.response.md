The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `len(digits)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(digits)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. The length of `digits` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue executing.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `password` must contain at least one digit; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password` and must have at least two digits; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`; `i` is 2.**
