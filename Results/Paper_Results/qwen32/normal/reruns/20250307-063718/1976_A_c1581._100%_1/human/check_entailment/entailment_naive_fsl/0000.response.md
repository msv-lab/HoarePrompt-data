Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that "there should be no digit that comes after a letter". The current implementation does not enforce this rule and only checks if the digits and letters are sorted individually and if the combined sorted string matches the input password.

Let's consider an example where the program will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
5
a1b2c
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Failure:**
- The password "a1b2c" has digits after letters, which violates the rule that no digit should come after a letter.
- The program, however, will sort the digits and letters separately and check if the combined sorted string matches the input. In this case, the sorted string would be "12abc", which is not the same as the input "a1b2c". But the program does not specifically check for the rule that no digit should come after a letter, so it might incorrectly return "YES" for some cases where the digits and letters are sorted individually but digits appear after letters in the original string.

To fix this, the program should check explicitly that no digit appears after a letter in the original password string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    # Check if the password has digits after letters
    seen_digit = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            seen_digit = True
        elif seen_digit:
            return False  # A letter after a digit found
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify passwords that do not meet the specified conditions.
