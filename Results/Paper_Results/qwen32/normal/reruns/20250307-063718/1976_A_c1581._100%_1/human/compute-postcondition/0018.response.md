The code snippet `letters.sort()` sorts the list `letters` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`. After sorting, the order of the letters in the `letters` list will be from 'a' to 'z' if they are present in the password.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password`; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`.**
