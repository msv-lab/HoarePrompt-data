The code appends the current character `char` to the `digits` list. Given that `char` is a digit, `digits` will now contain this digit. The values of `password`, `n`, and `letters` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is a list containing the digit `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**
