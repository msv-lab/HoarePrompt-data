The code snippet `digits.append(char)` adds the character `char` to the list `digits`. Given the initial state, if `char` was initially a digit, it was already the only element in the `digits` list, and `letters` was an empty list. If `char` was initially a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` was an empty list and `letters` contained `char`. After appending `char` to `digits`, `digits` will contain all previous elements of `digits` plus `char`.

Since the initial state specifies that `char` is the next character in `password` to be processed, and based on the condition provided, `char` will be added to `digits` regardless of its previous nature (digit or letter). This means that if `char` was initially a letter, `digits` will now contain that letter, and `letters` will still be empty. If `char` was initially a digit, `digits` will now contain all previous digits plus this new digit, and `letters` will still be empty.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `char` is the next character in `password` to be processed; `digits` is a list containing all previous digits in `password` plus `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**
