Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `password` must contain at least one digit; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password` and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`; `i` is 1. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues without returning False.**
