The code sorts the `digits` list. The `password` string and the `letters` list remain unchanged. The `digits` list, which originally contained all the digits from `password`, is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password`; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`.**
