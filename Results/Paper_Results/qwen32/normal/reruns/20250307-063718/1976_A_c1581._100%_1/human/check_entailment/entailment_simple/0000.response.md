### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Splitting Digits and Letters:**
     - The function iterates through each character in the password. If the character is a digit, it adds it to the `digits` list; otherwise, it adds it to the `letters` list.
   - **Sorting:**
     - Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - **Checking Conditions:**
     - The function then iterates through the `digits` list and checks if any digit is greater than the next digit. If so, it returns `False`.
     - It also checks if the last digit in the sorted `digits` list is greater than any letter in the sorted `letters` list. If so, it returns `False`.
   - **Reconstructing and Comparing:**
     - The function constructs a new string `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
     - It then checks if `sortedPassword` is equal to the original `password`. If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Issues:**
- The function does not correctly check the condition that no digit should come after a letter. It only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is insufficient.
- The correct condition should be that once a letter is encountered in the password, no digit should follow it.

**Corrected Condition:**
- The function should iterate through the password and ensure that after the first letter is encountered, no digit appears.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the current implementation does not correctly enforce the condition that no digit should come after a letter. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
