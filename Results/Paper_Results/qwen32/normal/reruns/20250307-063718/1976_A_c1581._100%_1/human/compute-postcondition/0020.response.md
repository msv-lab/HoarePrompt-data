Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `password` must contain at least one digit; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password` and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`; `i` is 0. The condition `i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]` is true, indicating that the list `digits` is not sorted in non-decreasing order at index `i`.**
