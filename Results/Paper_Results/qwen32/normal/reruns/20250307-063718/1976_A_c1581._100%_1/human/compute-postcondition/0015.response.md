Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. `char` is the next character in `password` to be processed. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing all previous digits in `password` plus `char`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing all previous lowercase Latin letters in `password` plus `char`.**
