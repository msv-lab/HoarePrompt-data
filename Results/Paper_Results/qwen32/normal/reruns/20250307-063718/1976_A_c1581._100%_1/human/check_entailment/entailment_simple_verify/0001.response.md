### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - **Separation of Characters:**
     - The program separates the password into `digits` and `letters` lists. This part is correct.
     - **Annotation State:** `digits` contains all digits, and `letters` contains all letters from the password.
   
   - **Sorting:**
     - Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted. This part is correct.
     - **Annotation State:** `digits` and `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
   - **Digit and Letter Order Check:**
     - The loop checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This part is correct.
     - The loop also checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter. This check is incorrect because it only ensures that the last digit does not exceed the first letter, but it does not ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the password.
     - **Annotation State:** The loop checks conditions related to digits and letters, but it does not correctly enforce the rule that no digit can come after a letter.
   
   - **Password Construction and Comparison:**
     - The program constructs `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
     - It then compares `sortedPassword` with the original password to determine if the password is strong.
     - **Annotation State:** The program checks if the concatenated sorted list matches the original password, which is incorrect because it does not validate the specific order constraints.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Order Constraint Handling:**
  - The program does not correctly enforce the rule that no digit can come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is insufficient. It should iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow.
  
- **Redundant Sorting and Comparison:**
  - The sorting and comparison approach does not correctly validate the problem's conditions. The program should directly check the order of characters in the original password.

### Corrected Approach:
- Iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow.
- Ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
- Ensure that all letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement that no digit can come after a letter. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
