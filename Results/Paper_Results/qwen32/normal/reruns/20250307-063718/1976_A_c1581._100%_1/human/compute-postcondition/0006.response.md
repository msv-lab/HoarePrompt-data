Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing one element, which is the lowercase Latin letter `char`.**

In simple terms, the `letters` list now contains the `char` element, while `password`, `digits`, and `n` remain unchanged.
