You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, both are in ascending order, and no digit is greater than any letter. It returns `True` if the password meets these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - It separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (ensuring no digit comes after a letter).
   - It constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It compares `sortedPassword` with the original password to determine if the password is strong.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit can come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks the last digit against the first letter. It should ensure that no digit is followed by a letter anywhere in the password.
- The function `func_1` should also check if the letters are in non-decreasing order, but this is already handled by sorting the `letters` list and comparing the `sortedPassword` with the original password.

### Corrected Approach:
- The program should iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow.
- It should also ensure that both the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement that no digit can come after a letter. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
