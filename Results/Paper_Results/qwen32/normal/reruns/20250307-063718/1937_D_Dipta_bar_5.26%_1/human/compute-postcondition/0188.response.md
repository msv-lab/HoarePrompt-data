The code snippet provided updates the value of `b` by adding the product of `(idx_B[r] - i)` and `l` to it. 

Given the initial state, the value of `b` is either updated based on the previous condition or retains its original value. The new value of `b` will be the sum of its previous value and `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
