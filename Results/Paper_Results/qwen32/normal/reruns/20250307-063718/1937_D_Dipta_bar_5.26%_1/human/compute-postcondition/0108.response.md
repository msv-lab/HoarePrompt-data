Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the variable `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, we know that `l` is at least 1 (as it must be greater than `r` which is at least 0). Therefore, `l - 1` is a valid index for the list `A`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `b` is now equal to the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`. All other variables retain their initial values.
