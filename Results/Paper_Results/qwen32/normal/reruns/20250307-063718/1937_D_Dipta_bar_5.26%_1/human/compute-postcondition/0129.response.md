The code snippet `b = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `l - 1` of list `A` to variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b` is now set to the element at index `l - 1` in list `A`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
