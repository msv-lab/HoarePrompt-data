To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and understand how the variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` evolve.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is an empty list.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Loop Structure Recap:
The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. For each iteration:
- `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
- If `s[i] == '<'`:
  - If `idx_B` is empty, `B` becomes `[0]` and `idx_B` becomes `[i]`.
  - If `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `B` appends `x`, and `idx_B` appends `i`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all `n` iterations, we need to consider the following:
- `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
- `B` and `idx_B` are modified based on the occurrences of '<' in `s` from right to left.

#### Explanation:
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `B` will contain cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.

### Final Output State in Format:
Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).**

In simpler terms, the final state is that `A` and `idx_A` remain the same, while `B` and `idx_B` are populated with values and indices of '<' characters, respectively, processed from right to left in the string `s`.
