The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `b` based on the current index `i` of the character '>', the last index in `idx_B`, and the value of `l`. The variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the given line of code.

Given:
- `b` is recalculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- `i` is the index of the current character '>'.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index in `idx_B`.
- `l` is 0.

The new value of `b` is calculated using the formula `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, which simplifies to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * 1` or simply `idx_B[r - 1] - i`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character `s[i]` is '>', `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `len(B) - 2`, `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] - i`.**
