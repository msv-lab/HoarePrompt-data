Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is not 0, then `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is 0 and `r` is not 0, then `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is 0, no further changes are made to `a` and `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both branches of the condition.
