To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`A`**: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
2. **`idx_A`**: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
3. **`B`**: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
4. **`idx_B`**: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
5. **`n`**: Is greater than 0.
6. **`i`**: Is 0.
7. **`r`**: Is decreased by 1.
8. **`a`**: Is `B[r]`.
9. **`b`**: Is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`a`**: This is set to `B[r]`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to know the value of `B[r]` before the decrement. Let's denote the value of `B[r]` as `B_r`.
2. **`b`**: This is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b + (-idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
3. **`n`**: This is a positive integer.
4. **`i`**: This is 0.
5. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     - `B_r * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 0)`
     - `B_r * 2 + b * 2 + n`

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `B_r * 2 + b * 2 + n`.

Since the exact values of `B_r`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **B_r * 2 + b * 2 + n (where B_r is B[r], b is the updated value of b, and n is a positive integer)**
