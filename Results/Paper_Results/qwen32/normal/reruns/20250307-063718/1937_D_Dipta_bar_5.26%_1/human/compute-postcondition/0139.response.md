Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the state).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is set to `n`.
- Therefore, `i + 1` will be `n + 1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `i + 1`, which is `n + 1`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **n + 1**
