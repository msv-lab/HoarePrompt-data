The code snippet `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the end of the list `B`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `B` contains an additional element `0` at the end.**
