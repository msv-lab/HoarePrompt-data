To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`A`**: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
2. **`idx_A`**: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
3. **`B`**: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
4. **`idx_B`**: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
5. **`n`**: Greater than 0.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n`.
7. **`a`**: Set to `A[l]`.
8. **`x`**: Set to `r - (l + 2)`.
9. **`b`**: Initially not mentioned, but updated based on the conditions:
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - Finally, `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Code Analysis

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's identify the values of `a`, `b`, and `i`:

1. **`a`**: `a` is `A[l]`, where `l` is an index into the list `A`. Since the exact value of `l` is not provided, we can denote it as `A[l]`.

2. **`b`**: The value of `b` is determined by the following conditions:
   - If `x` (which is `r - (l + 2)`) is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - Finally, `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   
   Since the exact values of `r`, `l`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we can denote `b` as the final value after these updates.

3. **`i`**: `i` is set to `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.

### Final Expression

The final expression to be printed is:
```python
a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1
```
Substituting the values we have:
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `b` is the final value after the updates described above.
- `i` is `n`.

Thus, the output of the print statement can be described as:
Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * b + n + 1 (where b is the final value after the updates based on the conditions involving B and idx_B)**
