The provided code snippet appends `0` to the list `A`. The value of `i` remains `i_prev + 2`, `s`, `n`, `idx_A` are unchanged from the previous iteration unless `s[i] == '>'` in which case `idx_A` has `i` appended to it, and `A` gets updated as per the given rules. However, the code snippet only appends `0` to `A` and does not alter `i`, `s`, `n`, or `idx_A` directly.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `A` has `0` appended to it; `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, except that if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` has `i` appended to it; and if `idx_A` was empty before appending `i`, a `0` was appended to `A` previously, otherwise, a new value `x` was appended to `A` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`**.
