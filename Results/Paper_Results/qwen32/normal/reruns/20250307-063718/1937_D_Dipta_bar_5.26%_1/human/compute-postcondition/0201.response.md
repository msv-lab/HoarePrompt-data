Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1, and if `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `x` is set to `r - (l + 2)` and `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, if `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `r` is decremented by 1, and if `l` is not 0, `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is 0 and `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is 0, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`.**
