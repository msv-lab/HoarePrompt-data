The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` was `i_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 2`.

Therefore, we increment `i` by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, except that if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` has `i` appended to it; and if `idx_A` was empty before appending `i`, a `0` was appended to `A` previously, otherwise, a new value `x` was appended to `A` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`**.
