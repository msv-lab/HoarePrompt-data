The provided Python code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, indicating that `B[r]` is the last element of the list `B`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and the conditions on `s[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r]`.**
