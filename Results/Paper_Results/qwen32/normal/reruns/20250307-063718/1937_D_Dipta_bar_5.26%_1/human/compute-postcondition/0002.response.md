The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `idx_A` as an empty list. No changes are made to the existing variables `s` and `A`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `idx_A` while keeping `s` as a string of '<' and '>' characters with length `n`, and `A` as an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**
