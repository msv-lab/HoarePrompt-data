To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
- `A`: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`. (The exact values are not specified, but we know they are derived from positions of '>' in the string `s`.)
- `idx_A`: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B`: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B`: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n`: Is greater than 0.
- `i`: Is 0.
- `r`: Is decreased by 1 (implying it was initially some positive value and is now one less than that value).
- `b`: Is updated to its previous value plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`. (The exact value of `b` is not specified, but we know it is updated based on the formula.)

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break this down:
- `a * 2`: Since `a` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume `a` is some value derived from `A` or another part of the code not provided. However, based on the format of the output, we will represent it as `a`.
- `b * 2`: `b` is updated based on the formula `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b * 2 = b * 2`.
- `i + 1`: Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `0 + 1 = 1`.

### Putting It All Together
The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + 1`.

Given that the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we will represent them as they are. Therefore, the output will be in terms of `a` and `b`.

### Final Output
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 (where a is a value derived from positions of '>' in `s` and b is updated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left)**
