The given code snippet modifies the variable `b` by adding to it the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `(r + 1)`. 

Initial State: 
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `B[r]`
- If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.

The code snippet modifies `b` as follows:
```
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
```

After this execution, `b` is updated to include the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.
