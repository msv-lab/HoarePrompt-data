Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **A and idx_A**: These variables contain values and indices related to the '>' characters in the string `s`.
2. **B and idx_B**: These variables contain cumulative values and indices related to the '<' characters in the string `s`, but in reverse order.
3. **l and r**: 
   - `l` is initialized to 0.
   - `r` is initialized to the length of `B`.
4. **n**: This is an integer that is greater than 0.
5. **s[i]**: The current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
6. **l is not less than r**: This condition implies that `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
7. **r is 0**: This directly implies that `r` is 0.

### Key Observations
- Given `r` is 0, the condition `l is not less than r` means `l` must also be 0.
- The current character `s[i]` is '>', which means `i` is the index of a '>' character in `s`.

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

- **n**: This is an integer greater than 0.
- **i**: This is the index of the current character in `s`, which is a '>'.
- **n - i**: This is the result of subtracting the index `i` from `n`.

### Conclusion
Given that `r` is 0 and `l` is not less than `r`, `l` must also be 0. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is the index of a '>' character in `s`. The print statement will output `n - i`.

### Final Output
The exact value of `n - i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `i`. However, based on the provided information, the print statement will output the result of `n - i`.

Output: **n - i (where n is an integer greater than 0 and i is the index of a '>' character in the string s)**
