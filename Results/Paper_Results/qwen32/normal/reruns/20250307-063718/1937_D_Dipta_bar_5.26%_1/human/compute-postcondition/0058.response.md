The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `l` to 0. The other variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0.**
