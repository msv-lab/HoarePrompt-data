To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
   - `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is updated based on the condition:
     - If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
     - Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is to be printed, followed by a space.

3. **Substituting known values:**
   - Since `i` is set to `n`, the term `(n - i)` becomes `0`.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2`.

4. **Values of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is calculated differently based on the condition `l - r > 0`:
     - If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
     - Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `r`, `l`, and `i` (which is `n`) are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

**Final Output:**
The print statement will output the value of `a * 2 + b * 2` where `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is calculated based on the condition `l - r > 0` as described above.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 (where a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r and b is calculated based on the condition l - r > 0)**
