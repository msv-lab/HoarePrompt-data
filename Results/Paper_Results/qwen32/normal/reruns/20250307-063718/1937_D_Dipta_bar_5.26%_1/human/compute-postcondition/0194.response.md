Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its previous value `A[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
