The code snippet calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, and `i`. The value of `x` is derived from the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, and the current value of `i`. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
