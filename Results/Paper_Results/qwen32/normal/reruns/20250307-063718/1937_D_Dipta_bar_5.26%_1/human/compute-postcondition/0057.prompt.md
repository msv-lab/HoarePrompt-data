Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`. If the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<', then if `idx_B` was an empty list, `B` becomes a list containing the value 0 and `idx_B` remains empty. Otherwise, `B` contains the value `x` (which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`), and `idx_B` has `i` appended to it, increasing its length by 1. If the current character at position `i` in `s` is not '<', then `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[i] == '<'`, then if `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` includes the newly appended value `x` and `i`. If `s[i] != '<'`, then no changes are made to `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` has an additional element `i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
