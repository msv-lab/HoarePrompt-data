Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character `s[i]` is '>', `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `len(B) - 2` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated to be the result of `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, where `x` is `len(B) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
