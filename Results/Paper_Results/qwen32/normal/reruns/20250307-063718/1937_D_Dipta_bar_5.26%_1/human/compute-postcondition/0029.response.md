The code snippet provided initializes a new list `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the existing variables `A` and `idx_A` or the previously defined list `B`. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `idx_B` which is set to an empty list.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.**
