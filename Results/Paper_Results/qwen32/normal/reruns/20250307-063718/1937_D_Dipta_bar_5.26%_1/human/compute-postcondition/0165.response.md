The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left)

The updated value of `b` is:
\[ b = (B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) \]

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.**

In natural language: The only variable that has changed is `b`, which now holds the value `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
