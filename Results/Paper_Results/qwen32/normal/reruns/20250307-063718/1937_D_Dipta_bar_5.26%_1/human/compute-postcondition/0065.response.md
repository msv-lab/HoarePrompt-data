The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given that `r` is the length of `B`, `r - 1` refers to the last index of `B`. Therefore, `b` will hold the last element of `B`.

The other variables remain unchanged by this operation. Specifically:
- `A` still contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` still contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` still contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` still contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` is still 0.
- `r` is still the length of `B`.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- The current character `s[i]` is still '>'.
- `a` is still `A[0]`.
- `x` is still `len(B) - 2`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character `s[i]` is '>', `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `len(B) - 2`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**
