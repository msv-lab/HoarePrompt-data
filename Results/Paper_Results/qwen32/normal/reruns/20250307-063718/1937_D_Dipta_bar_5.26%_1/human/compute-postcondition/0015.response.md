The code snippet calculates a new value for `x` based on the previous values of `A`, `i`, `idx_A`, and their respective indices. The value of `x` is computed as the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`. The variables `s`, `n`, `A`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged, while `i` is updated to `i_prev + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.
