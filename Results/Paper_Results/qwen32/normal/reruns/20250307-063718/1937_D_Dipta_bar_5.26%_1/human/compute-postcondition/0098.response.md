The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left)
- `l` is greater than 0
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- The condition `r - l >= 0` holds true
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`

After executing the code, the new value of `b` is:
\[ b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) \]

The other variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `s[i]`, `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left; `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left); `l` is greater than 0; `r` is the length of `B` minus 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `s[i]` is not equal to '>'; `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**
