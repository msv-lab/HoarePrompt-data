Given the code snippet and the initial state, the code modifies the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.

Here's the updated output state considering the changes:

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

In natural language, the value of `b` has been updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
