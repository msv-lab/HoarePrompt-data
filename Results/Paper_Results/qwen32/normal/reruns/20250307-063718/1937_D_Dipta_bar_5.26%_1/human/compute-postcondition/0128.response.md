The code snippet calculates the value of `a` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `i`. The value of `a` is computed as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**
