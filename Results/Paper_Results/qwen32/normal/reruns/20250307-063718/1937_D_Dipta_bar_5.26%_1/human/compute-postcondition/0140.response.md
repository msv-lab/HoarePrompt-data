The code snippet `a = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A` to the variable `a`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `r` are not changed by this line of code except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Given that `l` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume that `l` is a variable that has a specific value in the context where this code is executed. Since `l` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a` but we can describe the state in terms of `l`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1]`.**
