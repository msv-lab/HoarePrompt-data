The code snippet `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current index `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that the length of `idx_A` increases by 1, and the last element of `idx_A` becomes `i`.

Given the initial state, `idx_A` is a non-empty list, and the current character `s[i]` is '>'. After executing the code, `idx_A` will have `i` as its new last element. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing the single element 0, and `idx_A` remains empty. Otherwise, `A` is a list with the last element being `x`, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation, and `idx_A` is a non-empty list with the last element being `i`. The current character `s[i]` is '>'.**
