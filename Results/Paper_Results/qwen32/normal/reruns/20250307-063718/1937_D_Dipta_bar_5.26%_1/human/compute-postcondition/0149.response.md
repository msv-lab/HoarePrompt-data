Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values in the Context:**
    - `n` is a positive integer.
    - `i` is set to `n`, so `i` also holds the same value as `n`.
    - `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be an index used to access elements in `idx_A`. We need to assume `l` is a valid index within the bounds of `idx_A`.
    - `idx_A[l - 1]` refers to the element at the `(l - 1)`-th index in the `idx_A` list, which contains indices of '>' characters in `s`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
    - `n - i`: Since `i` is set to `n`, this expression evaluates to `n - n`, which is `0`.
    - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This part of the expression calculates the difference between `i` and the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character in `s`, then multiplies the result by `2`.

3. **Final Expression:**
    - The entire expression simplifies to `0 + (n - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which is `(n - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

### Conclusion:
The printed value will be `(n - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `idx_A[l - 1]` is an index of a '>' character in `s`, the exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]`. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given information.

### Output:
Output: **(n - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is a positive integer and idx_A[l - 1] is the index of the (l-1)-th '>' character in the string s)**
