The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1.**
