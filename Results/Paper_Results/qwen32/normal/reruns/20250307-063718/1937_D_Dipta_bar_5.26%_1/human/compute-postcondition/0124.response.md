Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.**
