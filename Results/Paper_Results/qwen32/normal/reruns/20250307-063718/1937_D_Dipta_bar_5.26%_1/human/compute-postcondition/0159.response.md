Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `s[i] == '>'`, the value of `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the conditions provided, updating `a` and `b` accordingly. If `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `b` is updated based on the value of `x`. If `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the provided conditions. If `s[i]` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the new value of `r` and `l`. `l` is incremented by 1 in the if part.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall effect of the if-else block on the variables `a`, `b`, `l`, and `r` based on the condition `s[i] == '>'`.
