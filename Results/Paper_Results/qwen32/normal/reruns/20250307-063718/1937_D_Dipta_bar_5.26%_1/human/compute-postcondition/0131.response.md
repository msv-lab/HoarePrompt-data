Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
