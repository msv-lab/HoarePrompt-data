Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The current character `s[i]` is '>'.
- `l` is not less than `r`.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` retains its original value.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Calculation of `a` and `b`
- `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is initially an undefined value but gets updated based on the condition `l - r > 0`. If true, it is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, it retains its original value (which we can assume to be 0 for this explanation, as it's not specified otherwise).
- `b` is then updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Substituting the Values
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` where `b` could be 0 if not updated by the condition.

Thus, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` becomes:
- `2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r) + 2 * (b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - i)`

Given the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b` without knowing the specific values of `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, `l`, and `r`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output Description
The print statement will output a value that is calculated based on the given variables and their relationships:
- `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is calculated as `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` where `b` could be 0 if not updated by the condition `l - r > 0`.
- The final printed value is `2 * a + 2 * b + (n - i)`.

Output: **2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r) + 2 * (b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - i) (where a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r and b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)**
