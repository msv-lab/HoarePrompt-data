To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables involved in the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

### Given:
- `A` contains values calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `a` is defined as `A[l]`, where `l` is an index used to access the list `A`.
- `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b = idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.
- `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so it is irrelevant for this calculation.

### Expression to Evaluate:
The expression to be evaluated is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Substituting the known values:
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.

The expression becomes:
\[ a \times 2 + b \times 2 + 0 + 1 = 2a + 2b + 1 \]

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement will be:
\[ 2a + 2b + 1 \]
where:
- `a` is the value at index `l` in the list `A`.
- `b` is the value calculated as `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **2a + 2b + 1 (where a is A[l] and b is idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1))**
