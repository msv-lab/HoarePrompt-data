The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from it. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and the condition `r - l >= 0` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is greater than 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is less than or equal to `r`. The condition `r - l >= 0` holds true. `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**
