To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` based on the input string `s`. The loop processes each character in `s` from left to right, adjusting `l` and `r` as it encounters '>' and '<' characters, respectively. The output is a series of computed values based on the current state of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and the current position `i`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
   - `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
   - `l` is initialized to 0.
   - `r` is initialized to the length of `B`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each character in `s`:
     - If the character is '>', `l` is incremented. If `l < r`, certain calculations involving `A` and `B` are performed and printed. If `l` is not less than `r`, different calculations are performed.
     - If the character is '<', `r` is decremented. Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, different calculations involving `A` and `B` are performed and printed.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After processing all characters in `s`, the final values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` will reflect the state after all iterations.
   - `l` will be equal to the number of '>' characters processed.
   - `r` will be equal to the number of '<' characters processed from right to left.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the need to compute specific values for `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` based on the input string `s`, we need to simulate the loop to determine the final state. However, since the problem does not provide the specific string `s`, we can describe the final state in a general form.

**Output State:**
After all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be:

- `A` will contain values calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` will contain indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` will contain cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` will contain indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` will be equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`.
- `r` will be 0 if all '<' characters have been processed, otherwise it will be the number of remaining '<' characters from right to left.

In natural language, the final output state is the state where all characters in the string `s` have been processed, and the variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` reflect the cumulative effects of processing these characters. The values of `l` and `r` will indicate the number of '>' and '<' characters processed, respectively.

Output State: **A contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r` is 0 if all '<' characters have been processed, otherwise it is the number of remaining '<' characters from right to left.**
