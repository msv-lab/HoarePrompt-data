The code snippet `b = B[r]` assigns the value at index `r` of the list `B` to the variable `b`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the variable `b` with a specific value from `B`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r]`.**
