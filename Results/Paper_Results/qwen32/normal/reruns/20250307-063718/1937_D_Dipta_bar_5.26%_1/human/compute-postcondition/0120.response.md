The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `a`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
