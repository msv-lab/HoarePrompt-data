The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `x` is being appended to `B`, the length of `B` increases by 1, and the last element of `B` becomes `x`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and `j` is `j + 1`. The list `idx_B` and its elements are also unchanged, as they are only used in the calculation of `x`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `B` has a new last element `x` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

In simpler terms, `B` now includes a new element `x` calculated based on the previous last element of `B` and other variables, while all other variables retain their previous values.
