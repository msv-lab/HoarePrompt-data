### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a grid for each cell, given the movement rules. The program uses a couple of arrays, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative values based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - It iterates through the string `s` to calculate values for `A` and `idx_A`:
     - `A` stores cumulative values based on the positions of '>' characters.
     - `idx_A` stores the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - It iterates through the string `s` in reverse to calculate values for `B` and `idx_B`:
     - `B` stores cumulative values based on the positions of '<' characters from right to left.
     - `idx_B` stores the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order.

4. **Calculating Output:**
   - It iterates through each cell in the grid and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current character ('<' or '>').
   - The calculations involve using the cumulative values stored in `A` and `B`, and adjusting them based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic of the program seems complex and involves intricate calculations based on cumulative values. However, the provided code does not match the expected output for the given example. Let's verify the correctness by comparing the expected output with the actual output produced by the code.

For the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
3
>><
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output from the provided code does not match the expected output. There are discrepancies in the calculated values, indicating that the logic or implementation might be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and comparison of the expected output with the actual output, the program does not appear to be correct.

**Correctness: False**
