The variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `B`, the value of `x` becomes `len(B) - 2`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current character `s[i]` is '>', and `a` is `A[0]`; `x` is `len(B) - 2`.**
