To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
   - `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (implying `r` was initially some value, possibly the length of `idx_B`).
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.

3. **Analyzing the expression:**
   - `a * 2`: This is twice the value of `a`.
   - `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`.
   - `i + 1`: This is the value of `i` plus 1.

4. **Substituting the expressions:**
   - The final expression to be printed is `2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * b + i + 1`.

5. **Description of the output:**
   - The output will be a single number calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `b`, `i`, `l`, and `idx_B` as described above.
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `i`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the expression precisely.

Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * b + i + 1 (where A[l - 1] is the l-th element of A, idx_A[l - 1] is the l-th element of idx_A, b is the cumulative value, i is the current index, and l is some index used in the calculations)**
