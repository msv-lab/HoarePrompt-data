The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left; `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left); `l` is greater than 0; `r` is the length of `B` minus 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `s[i]` is not equal to '>'; `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; if `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
