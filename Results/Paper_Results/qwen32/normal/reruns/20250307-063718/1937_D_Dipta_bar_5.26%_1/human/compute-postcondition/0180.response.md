The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which means the value of `r` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `r`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1.**
