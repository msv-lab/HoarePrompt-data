Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` now includes the newly appended value `x`.**
