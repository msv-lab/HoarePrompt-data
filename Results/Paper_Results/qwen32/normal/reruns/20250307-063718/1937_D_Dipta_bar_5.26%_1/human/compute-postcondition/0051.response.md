The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. This modifies the list `B` by adding `0` as its new last element. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `B` contains its previous elements with an additional `0` appended to it.**
