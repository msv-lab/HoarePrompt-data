The provided code modifies the value of `b` based on the current values of `b`, `idx_B`, `r`, `l`, and `i`. The new value of `b` is calculated by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value.

Given the initial state, `b` is initially `B[r] - B[r - l]`. After the code executes, `b` becomes:

\[ b = (B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) \]

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `(B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**.
