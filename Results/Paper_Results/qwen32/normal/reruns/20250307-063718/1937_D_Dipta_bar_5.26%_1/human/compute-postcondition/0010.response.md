Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. If `idx_A` is empty, then `A` is a list containing the single element 0, and `idx_A` remains empty. Otherwise, `A` is a list with the last element being `x`, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation, and `idx_A` is a non-empty list. The current character `s[i]` is '>'.**
