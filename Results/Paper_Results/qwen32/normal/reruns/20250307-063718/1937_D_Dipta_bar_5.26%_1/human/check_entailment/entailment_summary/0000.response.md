Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The program uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of '<' and '>' characters, respectively, as the pinball moves through the grid. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and for each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative movement based on the previous '>' characters and their positions.
   - The list `A` stores these cumulative movements, and `idx_A` stores the positions of '>' characters.

2. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates through the string `s` in reverse and for each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative movement based on the previous '<' characters and their positions.
   - The list `B` stores these cumulative movements, and `idx_B` stores the positions of '<' characters.

3. **Calculating Pinball Movement Time:**
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, the program determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the position of the character (`'<'` or `'>'`) and the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The program uses the indices `l` and `r` to keep track of the current position in `A` and `B` respectively, updating them as it processes each position in the string.

The program's logic seems to be based on the idea that the pinball's movement can be broken down into segments between '>' and '<' characters, and the cumulative movements can be reused to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

However, there are several issues with the provided code that make it incorrect:
- The logic for calculating the pinball movement time is overly complex and seems to have incorrect calculations, especially in the way it handles the cumulative movements and indices.
- The program does not correctly handle the inversion of characters after each move, which is a key part of the problem.
- The program does not correctly account for the pinball leaving the grid, which can happen when the pinball moves beyond the left or right border of the grid.

Given the complexity and the presence of these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
