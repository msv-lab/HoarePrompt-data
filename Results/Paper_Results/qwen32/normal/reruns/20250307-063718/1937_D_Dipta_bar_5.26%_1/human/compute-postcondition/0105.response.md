To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **`A`**: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
2. **`idx_A`**: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
3. **`B`**: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
4. **`idx_B`**: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
5. **`l`**: Initialized to 0.
6. **`r`**: Initialized to 0.
7. **`n`**: Must be greater than 0.
8. **`s[i]`**: Not equal to '>'.
9. **`l > r`**: Not applicable as `r` is 0.

### Code Snippet Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **`l - 1`**: Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` equals `-1`. This means the code is trying to access the last element of `idx_A` using negative indexing.
2. **`idx_A[l - 1]`**: This will be the last element of `idx_A` because of negative indexing. Let's denote this value as `idx_A_last`.
3. **`i - idx_A_last`**: This is the difference between the current index `i` and the last index of '>' in `s`.
4. **`(i - idx_A_last) * 2`**: This multiplies the difference by 2.
5. **`n - i + (i - idx_A_last) * 2`**: This is the final expression to be printed. It combines `n - i` and the doubled difference calculated above.

### Output Description
Given the initial state, the exact value of `i` is not provided, but we can describe the output in terms of `i` and `idx_A_last`.

- **`n`**: A positive integer.
- **`i`**: An index in the string `s` where `s[i]` is not equal to '>'.
- **`idx_A_last`**: The last index of '>' in `s`.

The printed output will be:
\[ n - i + (i - \text{idx\_A\_last}) \times 2 \]

### Final Output
Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A_last) * 2 (where idx_A_last is the last index of '>' in the string s)**
