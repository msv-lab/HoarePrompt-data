The given code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. This means `idx_B` will now contain one more element, which is `i`. The values of other variables like `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The length of `idx_B` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<'. If `idx_B` was an empty list, `B` becomes a list containing the value 0 and `len(idx_B)` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx_B` is not empty, `B` contains the value `x` (which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`), and `len(idx_B)` remains unchanged. Now, `idx_B` has `i` appended to it, and `len(idx_B)` is increased by 1.**
