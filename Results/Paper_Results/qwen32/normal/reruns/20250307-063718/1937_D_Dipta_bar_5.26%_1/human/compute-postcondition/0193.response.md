The code snippet `b = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A` to the variable `b`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged except for `b` which is newly assigned a value.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
