Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration except that a `0` has been appended to it. Otherwise, `A` is the list with the new value `x` appended to it, where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation.**
