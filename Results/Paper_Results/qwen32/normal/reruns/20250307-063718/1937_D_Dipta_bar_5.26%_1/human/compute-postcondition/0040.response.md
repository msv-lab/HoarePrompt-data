Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`. If the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<', then if `idx_B` was an empty list, `B` becomes a list containing the value 0 and `idx_B` remains empty. Otherwise, `B` contains the value `x` (which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`), and `idx_B` has `i` appended to it, increasing its length by 1. If the current character at position `i` in `s` is not '<', then `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**
