The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, but since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`, the loop cannot execute again once `i` is `n`.

However, if we are to consider the state right before the loop terminates, we would adjust `i` to the next value it would take if the loop were to continue, which would be `n`.

State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
