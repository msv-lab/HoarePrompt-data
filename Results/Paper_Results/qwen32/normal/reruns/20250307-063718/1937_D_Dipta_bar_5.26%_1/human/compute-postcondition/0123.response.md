The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting a calculated expression from it. The expression involves the indices stored in `idx_B` and the variable `x`.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) \]

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**.
