The given code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. 

Given the initial state, the value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`. After the execution of the code, the new value of `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.

The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `s[i]` remain unchanged. The conditions `l` not being less than `r`, `r` not being equal to 0, and `l - r` being greater than 0 also remain valid.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '>', `l` is not less than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. `l - r` is greater than 0.**
