The code snippet provided modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, we can determine the new value of `b` after this operation.

Initial State: 
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left)
- `l` is 0
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'
- `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0
- `a` is `B[r]`
- `b` is `A[l - 1]`
- `l - r - 1 > 0`

The line of code `b = b - A[l - r - 2]` modifies the value of `b`. Since `b` was initially `A[l - 1]`, the new value of `b` will be `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`, and `l - r - 1 > 0`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `b` is now the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its previous value `A[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
