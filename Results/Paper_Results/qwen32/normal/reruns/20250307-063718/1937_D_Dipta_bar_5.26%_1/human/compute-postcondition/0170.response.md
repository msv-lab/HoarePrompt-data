The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `a` based on the expression `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. The variables `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `i` are used in this calculation. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, and the current state of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**

In simpler terms, the Output State is: `A` and `idx_A` remain the same, `B` and `idx_B` remain the same, `n` and `i` remain the same, and `a` is now calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
