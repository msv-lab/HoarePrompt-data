Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is set to 1, and if `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[0]` and `x` is set to `len(B) - 2`, and `b` is set to `idx_B[r - 1] - i`. If `l` is not less than `r`, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is not '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `l` is greater than 0, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` remains the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is 0, `r` remains 0.**
