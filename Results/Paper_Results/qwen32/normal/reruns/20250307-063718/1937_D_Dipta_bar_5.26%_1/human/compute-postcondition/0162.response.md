The code snippet `x = r - (l + 2)` calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `r` and `l`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, and `a` are not affected by this calculation.

Given that `r` and `l` are not defined in the initial state, we will assume they are provided or defined elsewhere in the code. The output state will reflect the new value of `x` based on the expression provided.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.**
