The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` is calculated based on the previous elements of `A` and `idx_A`. Since `A` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before appending.

After appending `x` to `A`, the length of `A` increases by 1, and the last element of `A` is now `x`. The values of `s`, `idx_A`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`; `A` is a list with the last element being `x`; `idx_A` is a non-empty list; `i` is the current index where `s[i]` is '>'; `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation.**
