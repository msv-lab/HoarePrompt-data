Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `B[r]`.**
