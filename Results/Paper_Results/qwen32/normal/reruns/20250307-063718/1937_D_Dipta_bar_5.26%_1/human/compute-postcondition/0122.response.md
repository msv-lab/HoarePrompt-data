Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, where `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
