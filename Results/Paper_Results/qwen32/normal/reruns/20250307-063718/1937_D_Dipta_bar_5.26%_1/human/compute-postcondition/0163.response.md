The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means the value at the index `r - 1` in the list `B` is now stored in `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**
