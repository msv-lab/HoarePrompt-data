To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to break down the given information and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` is greater than 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Calculation of `a` and `b`:
- `a` is derived from the elements of `A` and the index `i` relative to `idx_A[l - 1]`.
- `b` is derived from the elements of `B` and the index `i` relative to `idx_B[r - l]` and `idx_B[r]`.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Calculate `a`:**
   - `a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
   - `A[l - 1]` is the value in `A` at position `l - 1`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` is the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last '>' character before `i`.
   - `l` is a multiplier that scales the difference.

2. **Calculate `b`:**
   - `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`
   - `B[r]` and `B[r - l]` are cumulative values from `B`.
   - `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(idx_B[r] - i)` are differences between the current index `i` and the indices of the '<' characters.
   - `r - l` and `l` are multipliers that scale the differences.

3. **Combine `a` and `b` in the print statement:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is the final expression to be printed.
   - This expression scales `a` and `b` by 2, adds the current index `i`, and then adds 1.

### Output:
Given the expressions for `a` and `b`, the final output of the print statement is:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, i is the current index, and l is the current position in A and r is the current position in B)**
