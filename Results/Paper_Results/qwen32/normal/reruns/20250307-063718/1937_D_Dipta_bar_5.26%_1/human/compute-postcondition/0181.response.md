Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- The print statement will output `i + 1`.
- Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` evaluates to 1.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be used as the ending character instead of the default newline.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `i + 1`, which is 1, followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
