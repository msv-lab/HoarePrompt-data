The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `b` is now assigned the value of `B[r - 1]`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
