Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the value `x` (which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`), `idx_B` is not an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**

In simple terms, the value of `x` has been appended to the list `B`. All other variables retain their previous states.
