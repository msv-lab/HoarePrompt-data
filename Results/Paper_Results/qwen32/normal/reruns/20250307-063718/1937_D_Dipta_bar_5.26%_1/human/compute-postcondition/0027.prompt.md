Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. If `s[i]` is '>', and `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing the single element 0, and `idx_A` remains empty. Otherwise, `A` is a list with the last element being `x`, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation, and `idx_A` is a non-empty list with the last element being `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', no changes are made to `A` or `idx_A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, except that if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` has `i` appended to it; and if `idx_A` was empty before appending `i`, a `0` was appended to `A` previously, otherwise, a new value `x` was appended to `A` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; if `s[i] == '>'`, then `idx_A` has `i` appended to it, and if `idx_A` was empty before appending `i`, `A` has `0` appended to it, otherwise, `A` has a new element `x` appended, where `x = A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
