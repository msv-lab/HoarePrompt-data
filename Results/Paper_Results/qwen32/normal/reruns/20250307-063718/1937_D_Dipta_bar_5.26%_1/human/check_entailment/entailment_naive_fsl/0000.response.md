Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the pinball movement as described in the problem. Specifically, the code does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters in the grid.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Character Inversion**: The problem states that after the pinball moves from a cell, the character in that cell is inverted. However, the provided code does not perform this inversion. This means that the pinball's movement will not be correctly simulated because it relies on the current state of the grid, which is not updated after each move.

2. **Logic for Movement**: The logic in `func_1` is complex and does not seem to correctly simulate the pinball's movement. The calculations for `A` and `B` arrays and their usage to determine the number of seconds are not straightforward and seem to be incorrect. The pinball's movement should be simulated step-by-step, and the grid should be updated after each move.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, if the grid contains only '<' or only '>', the pinball should leave the grid in a specific number of steps, which the current code might not correctly compute.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a simple test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
<<<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3
```

**Explanation:**
- For the first cell (i=0), the pinball moves left and leaves the grid in 1 second.
- For the second cell (i=1), the pinball moves left, then left again, and leaves the grid in 2 seconds.
- For the third cell (i=2), the pinball moves left three times and leaves the grid in 3 seconds.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate this simple case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the lack of character inversion and incorrect logic for simulating the pinball's movement.
