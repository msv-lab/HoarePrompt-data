To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The current character `s[i]` is '>'.
- `a` is `A[0]`.
- `x` is `len(B) - 2`.
- `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] - i`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `a * 2`: This is twice the value of the first element of `A`.
- `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`, which is defined as `idx_B[r - 1] - i`.
- `i + 1`: This is the current index `i` plus 1.

### Calculation:
- Since `a` is `A[0]`, we need to know the value of `A[0]`. However, without the exact list `A`, we can only represent it as `A[0]`.
- `b` is defined as `idx_B[r - 1] - i`. Here, `r` is the length of `B`, and `idx_B` contains indices of '<' characters in `s` from right to left. Therefore, `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the first '<' character from the right. Thus, `b` is the difference between the index of the first '<' character from the right and the current index `i`.
- `i + 1` is simply the current index `i` plus 1.

### Output Expression:
The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[0], b is idx_B[r - 1] - i, and i is the current index where s[i] is '>')**
