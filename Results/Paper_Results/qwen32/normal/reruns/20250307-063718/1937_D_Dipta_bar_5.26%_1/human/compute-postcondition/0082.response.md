The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to it. This change is based on the current character `s[i]` being '>', and the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '>', `l` is not less than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` retains its original value. `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In simple terms, the variable `b` has been updated by adding the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its previous value. All other variables retain their original states as described in the initial conditions.
