The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `a` based on the current values of `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `i`. The variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `s[i]` are not modified by this snippet, so they retain their initial values. The variable `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.

Given the initial conditions, the output state will be:

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '>', and `l` is not less than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**

In plain English: The value of `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other variables retain their initial values.
