Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>'. If `r` is 0, `r` remains 0. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Additionally, `l` is greater than `r` is not applicable when `r` is 0.**
