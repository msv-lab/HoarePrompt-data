To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:

1. **A**: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in string `s`.
2. **idx_A**: Contains indices of all '>' characters in string `s`.
3. **B**: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in string `s` from right to left.
4. **idx_B**: Contains indices of all '<' characters in string `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
5. **n**: Must be greater than 0.
6. **i**: Initially set to `n`, but it could be decremented or updated based on the context.
7. **r**: Decreased by 1 at some point.
8. **a**: Set to `B[r]`.
9. **b**: Updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Variables to be Printed:

- **a * 2**: Twice the value of `a`.
- **b * 2**: Twice the value of `b`.
- **n - i**: Difference between `n` and `i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **a**: Since `a` is `B[r]`, it is the value in list `B` at index `r`. The value of `r` is not explicitly given, but it is known that `r` is decreased by 1 at some point. Therefore, `a` is the value of `B[r]` where `r` is the current index.
   
2. **b**: The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Here, `i` is the current value, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the value from the list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`, and `r` is the current index. The exact value of `b` depends on the initial value of `b` and the updates made to it.

3. **n - i**: This is simply the difference between `n` and the current value of `i`.

### Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:

- **a * 2**: Twice the value of `B[r]`.
- **b * 2**: Twice the value of `b` after all updates.
- **n - i**: The difference between the initial value `n` and the current value `i`.

Since the exact values of `r`, `b`, `i`, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - i) (where a is B[r], b is updated as b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), and n - i is the difference between n and the current value of i)**
