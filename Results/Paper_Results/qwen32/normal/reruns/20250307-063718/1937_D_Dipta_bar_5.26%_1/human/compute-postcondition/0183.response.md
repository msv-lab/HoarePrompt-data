The code snippet provided modifies the variable `a` by adding to it the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression used to calculate the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**
