To determine the exact output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the problem step by step using the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `A`: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A`: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B`: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
   - `idx_B`: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
   - `n`: Greater than 0.
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `a`: Calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b`: Calculated based on the condition:
     - If `l - r > 0`, then `b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
     - Otherwise, `b = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is: `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`.

3. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - `a` and `b` are complex expressions involving elements from `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` lists, as well as the variables `i`, `r`, and `l`.
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`.
   - However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables and parameters.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`: This expression combines the values of `a` and `b` (each multiplied by 2) and adds the result of `(n - i)`.

5. **Output Description**:
   - The output will be a computed value based on the described expressions for `a` and `b`, and the given values of `n` and `i`.
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output.

Given this breakdown, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r if l - r > 0, otherwise b is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, n is greater than 0, and i is 0)**
