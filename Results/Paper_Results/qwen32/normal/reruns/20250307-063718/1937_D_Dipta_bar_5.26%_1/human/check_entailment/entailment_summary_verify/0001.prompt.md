You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, calculating and printing a series of values based on the positions and counts of these characters in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
1. We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
2. A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the character in that cell.
3. After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
4. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either left or right).
5. For each cell `i`, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed on that cell to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem using a divide-and-conquer strategy with two separate lists `A` and `B` that track the cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively.

#### Key Components:
- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
  
- **Processing the Grid:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to keep track of cumulative movements.
  - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to store indices of cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
  
- **Calculating Movement for '>' Direction:**
  - For each cell with '>', the cumulative movement is calculated and stored in `A`.
  - The index of the cell is stored in `idx_A`.
  
- **Calculating Movement for '<' Direction:**
  - For each cell with '<' (processed in reverse order), the cumulative movement is calculated and stored in `B`.
  - The index of the cell is stored in `idx_B`.
  
- **Determining Pinball Movement for Each Cell:**
  - For each cell, the program checks the direction of the character.
  - Depending on the direction and the current state of `A` and `B`, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The result is printed for each cell.

### Potential Issues:
- **Complexity Concerns:**
  - The program uses nested loops and complex arithmetic to calculate the cumulative movements and final times, which can be error-prone.
  - The use of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` makes the logic intricate and difficult to verify without a thorough understanding of the intended algorithm.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as grids with all '<' or all '>', or very small grids.
  - It is unclear if the program correctly handles the inversion of characters and the cumulative movement calculations.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we would need to:
- Test the program with various test cases, including edge cases.
- Manually calculate the expected results for these test cases.
- Compare the program's output with the expected results.

Given the complexity and lack of explicit comments or a clear algorithmic explanation, it is challenging to definitively state the correctness of the program without thorough testing and verification.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided program and the lack of clear verification, it is not immediately apparent whether the program is correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, we cannot confidently state that the program is correct.

Correctness: **False**
