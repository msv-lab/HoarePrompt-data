The code snippet `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, and the expression for `x` remain unchanged except for the modification to `A`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `A` is the list with the new value `x` appended to it; `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration; `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation.**
