To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context of the `print` statement.

From the initial state:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'.
- `l` is currently 0.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. However, based on typical usage in such scenarios, `i` is often an index variable used in a loop. Since there's no loop provided in the snippet, we need to infer `i` from the context.

Given that `l` is 0 and `l` is less than or equal to `r`, it suggests that `i` might be related to `l` or `r`. However, without a loop or a specific definition of `i`, we can only assume that `i` is currently set to `l` (which is 0) based on common practices.

Let's assume `i` is currently set to `l` (which is 0) for the sake of this explanation.

Therefore, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Output: **1 ** (where the trailing space is due to `end=' '`)
