Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- The expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is simply `n`.

Given that `i` is 0, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **n**
