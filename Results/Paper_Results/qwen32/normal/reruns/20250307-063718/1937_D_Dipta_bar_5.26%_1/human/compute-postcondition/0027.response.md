To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided loop and its effects on the variables `A` and `idx_A`.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` of length `n`, and performs the following actions based on the character:

1. **If `s[i]` is '>'**:
    - If `idx_A` is empty, append `0` to `A` and append `i` to `idx_A`.
    - If `idx_A` is not empty, calculate `x` as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and append `x` to `A`. Then append `i` to `idx_A`.

2. **If `s[i]` is '<'**:
    - No changes are made to `A` or `idx_A`.

### Iteration Details

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n`.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `idx_A` is an empty list.

Let's consider the output state after the first three iterations:

- **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
    - If `s[0]` is '>', `A` becomes `[0]` and `idx_A` becomes `[0]`.
    - If `s[0]` is '<', no changes occur.

- **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
    - If `s[1]` is '>', and `idx_A` is not empty (from previous iteration), calculate `x` and append to `A`, then append `1` to `idx_A`.
    - If `s[1]` is '<', no changes occur.

- **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
    - If `s[2]` is '>', and `idx_A` is not empty, calculate `x` and append to `A`, then append `2` to `idx_A`.
    - If `s[2]` is '<', no changes occur.

### General Pattern

For each '>' character in `s`:
- If `idx_A` is empty, `0` is appended to `A`, and the current index `i` is appended to `idx_A`.
- If `idx_A` is not empty, a new value `x` is calculated and appended to `A`, and the current index `i` is appended to `idx_A`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, `A` will contain a series of values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`, and `idx_A` will contain the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

- `A` will have a number of elements equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`.
- `idx_A` will have a number of elements equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`, and each element will be the index of a '>' character in `s`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, and `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

In natural language, this means:
- `A` will have as many elements as there are '>' characters in `s`, with each element calculated based on the position of the '>' characters and the previous values in `A`.
- `idx_A` will list the indices of all '>' characters found in the string `s`.
