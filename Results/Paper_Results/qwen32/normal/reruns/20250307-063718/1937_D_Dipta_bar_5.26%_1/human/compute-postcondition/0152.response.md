Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
