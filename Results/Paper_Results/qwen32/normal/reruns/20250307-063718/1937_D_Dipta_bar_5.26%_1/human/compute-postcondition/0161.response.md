The code snippet `a = A[l]` assigns the value at index `l` of list `A` to the variable `a`. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. Since the value of `l` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`, but we know it will be the element at position `l` in `A`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `A[l]`.**
