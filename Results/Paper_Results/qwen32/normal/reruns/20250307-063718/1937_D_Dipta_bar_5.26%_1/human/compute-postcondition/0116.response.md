Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>'. If `l` was initially 0 and `l` remains 0, `a` is not updated. If `l` is greater than 0, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` remains the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is 0, `r` remains 0.**
