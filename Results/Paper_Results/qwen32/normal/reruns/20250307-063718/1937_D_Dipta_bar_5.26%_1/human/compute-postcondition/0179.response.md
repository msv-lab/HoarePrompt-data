The code snippet provided increments the value of `l` by 1. This change impacts the value of `l` directly, while the other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `x`, `b`, `r`) remain unchanged unless they depend on the value of `l`.

Since the value of `l` is incremented, the conditions involving `l` and `r` in the initial state description might now evaluate differently. However, without specific values for `l` and `r`, we can only state that `l` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, then `a` is `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, if `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
