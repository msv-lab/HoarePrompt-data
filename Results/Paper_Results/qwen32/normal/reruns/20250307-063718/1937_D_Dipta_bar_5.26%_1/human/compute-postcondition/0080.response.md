Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '>', `l` is not less than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. `l - r` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting the product of the difference between the last and the (l-r-1)th indices in `idx_A` and the difference between `l` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
