Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r]`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.**
