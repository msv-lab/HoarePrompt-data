The code snippet `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. This means that the length of `A` increases by 1, and the last element of `A` is `0`. The other variables `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, and `idx_A` are mentioned, but only `A` is changed by the code. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration except that a `0` has been appended to it; `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**
