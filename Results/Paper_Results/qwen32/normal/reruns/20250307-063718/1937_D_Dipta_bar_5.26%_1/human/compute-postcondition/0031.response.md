The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `i` based on the value of `n` and `j`. The value of `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. The other variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. Since `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `j` is not specified, `i` will be calculated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`.**
