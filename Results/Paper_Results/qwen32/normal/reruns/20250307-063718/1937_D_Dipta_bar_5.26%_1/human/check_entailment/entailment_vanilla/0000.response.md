Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
1. We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
2. A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the character in that cell.
3. After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
4. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either left or right).
5. For each cell `i`, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed on that cell to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem using a divide-and-conquer strategy with two separate lists `A` and `B` that track the cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively.

#### Key Components:
- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
  
- **Processing the Grid:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to keep track of cumulative movements.
  - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to store indices of cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
  
- **Calculating Movement for '>' Direction:**
  - For each cell with '>', the cumulative movement is calculated and stored in `A`.
  - The index of the cell is stored in `idx_A`.
  
- **Calculating Movement for '<' Direction:**
  - For each cell with '<' (processed in reverse order), the cumulative movement is calculated and stored in `B`.
  - The index of the cell is stored in `idx_B`.
  
- **Determining Pinball Movement for Each Cell:**
  - For each cell, the program checks the direction of the character.
  - Depending on the direction and the current state of `A` and `B`, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The result is printed for each cell.

### Potential Issues:
- **Complexity Concerns:**
  - The program uses nested loops and complex arithmetic to calculate the cumulative movements and final times, which can be error-prone.
  - The use of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` makes the logic intricate and difficult to verify without a thorough understanding of the intended algorithm.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as grids with all '<' or all '>', or very small grids.
  - It is unclear if the program correctly handles the inversion of characters and the cumulative movement calculations.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we would need to:
- Test the program with various test cases, including edge cases.
- Manually calculate the expected results for these test cases.
- Compare the program's output with the expected results.

Given the complexity and lack of explicit comments or a clear algorithmic explanation, it is challenging to definitively state the correctness of the program without thorough testing and verification.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided program and the lack of clear verification, it is not immediately apparent whether the program is correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, we cannot confidently state that the program is correct.

Correctness: **False**
