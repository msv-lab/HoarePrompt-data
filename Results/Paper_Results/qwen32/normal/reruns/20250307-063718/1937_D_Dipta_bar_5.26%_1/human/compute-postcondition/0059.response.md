The code snippet assigns the length of list `B` to the variable `r`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.**
