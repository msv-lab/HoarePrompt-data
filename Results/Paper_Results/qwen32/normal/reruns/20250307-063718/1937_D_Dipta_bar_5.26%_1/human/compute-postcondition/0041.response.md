The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1 - i`, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Given `i = n - 1 - j`, we can derive that at the end of the last iteration, `j` was `n - 1 - i`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration:
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - 1 - j`.
- For the next iteration, `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- Therefore, `i` becomes `n - 1 - (j + 1)` which simplifies to `i - 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is decremented by 1.

The states of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Simplified State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**.
