The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n`.

Since `i` was `n` at the end of the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `0` to start the loop from the beginning.

State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
