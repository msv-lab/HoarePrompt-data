The code snippet provided assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the value stored at the index `l - 1` in the list `A`.

The initial state mentioned includes several variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `r`), but only `a` is affected by this assignment. The other variables retain their initial values unless specified otherwise.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]`.**
