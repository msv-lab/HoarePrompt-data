The provided code snippet calculates a value for `x` based on the current state of the variables `A`, `idx_A`, and `i`. Here's the breakdown of the impact and the resulting output state:

- `x` is assigned the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- `A` is an empty list, so `A[len(A) - 1]` is not a valid operation because `A` has no elements. However, since the problem statement does not specify the state of `A` after it is initially empty, we need to assume that `A` has at least one element for this calculation to be valid. Let's assume `A` has at least one element, and we proceed with the calculation.
- `idx_A` is a non-empty list, so `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` refers to the last element of `idx_A`.
- `i` is the current index where `s[i]` is '>', and its value is known but not specified in the initial state.

Given these points, let's assume `A` has at least one element, say `A = [a0, a1, ..., ak]`, where `ak` is the last element of `A`. Then, `A[len(A) - 1]` would be `ak`.

The output state would be:
- `x` is calculated as `ak + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`.
- `A` remains an empty list (unless it was modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here).
- `idx_A` remains a non-empty list.
- `i` remains the current index where `s[i]` is '>'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is a non-empty list; `i` is the current index where `s[i]` is '>'; `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` assuming `A` has at least one element.**
