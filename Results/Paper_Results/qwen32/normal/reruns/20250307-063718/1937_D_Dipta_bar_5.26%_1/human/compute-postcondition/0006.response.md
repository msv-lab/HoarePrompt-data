Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `A` is a list containing the single element 0; `idx_A` is an empty list; the current character `s[i]` is '>'; `idx_A` is empty.**

Natural language: The string `s` remains unchanged, and its length `n` remains the same. The list `A` now contains one element, which is 0. The list `idx_A` is still empty. The current character `s[i]` is still '>'.
