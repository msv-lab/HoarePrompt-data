To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given variables and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement).

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2
```
Let's break it down:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `l` is not defined in the given context, but it seems to be used as an index to access `idx_A`.

### Assumptions:
- `l` is a variable that should be defined before this print statement. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `l` is some valid index within the bounds of `idx_A`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. `n - i` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is `n`.
2. `i - idx_A[l - 1]` simplifies to `0 - idx_A[l - 1]`, which is `-idx_A[l - 1]`.
3. `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` simplifies to `-idx_A[l - 1] * 2`, which is `-2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.
4. Combining these, the expression becomes `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

### Final Expression:
The final expression that will be printed is:
```python
n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]
```

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] (where n is a value greater than 0, and idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in the string s, and l is a valid index within the bounds of idx_A)**
