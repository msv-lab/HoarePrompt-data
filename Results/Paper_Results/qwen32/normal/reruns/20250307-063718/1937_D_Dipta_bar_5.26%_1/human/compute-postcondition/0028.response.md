The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `B`. This operation does not affect the values of `A` or `idx_A`. Therefore, the initial state of `A` and `idx_A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, and `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `B` is an empty list.**
