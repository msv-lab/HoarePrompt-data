Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` contains its previous elements with an additional `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `B` has a new last element `x` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`.**
