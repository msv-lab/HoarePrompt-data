The code snippet `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that `idx_A` will now include the new value `i` at the end of the list.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.
- If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration except that a `0` has been appended to it.
- Otherwise, `A` is the list with the new value `x` appended to it, where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before the append operation.

After executing `idx_A.append(i)`, the value of `idx_A` will have `i` as its new last element. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, and `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `idx_A` has `i` appended to it; `A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration except that if `idx_A` was empty, a `0` was appended to `A` previously, otherwise, a new value `x` was appended to `A` where `x` is `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`.**
