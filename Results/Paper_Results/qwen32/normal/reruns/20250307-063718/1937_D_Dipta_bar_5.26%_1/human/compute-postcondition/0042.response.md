The code snippet `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i`. The variables `n` and `j` are used in the calculation, and `i` is reassigned the result of this expression. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, and the original value of `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is `j + 1`, the new value of `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)` which simplifies to `n - 2 - j`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
