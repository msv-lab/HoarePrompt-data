The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. No other variables are directly affected by this operation, except for `idx_B` which now contains one additional element.

Given the initial state:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`
- `j` is `j + 1`
- If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` contains its previous elements with an additional `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `B` has a new last element `x` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`
- `idx_B.append(i)`

The only change is the addition of `i` to the list `idx_B`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `j` is `j + 1`; `idx_B` has an additional element `i` appended to it.**
