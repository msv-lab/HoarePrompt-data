The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is greater than 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>', and `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is assigned the value `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is greater than 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>', and `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**
