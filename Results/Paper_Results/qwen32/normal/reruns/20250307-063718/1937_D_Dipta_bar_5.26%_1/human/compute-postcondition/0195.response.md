The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting a calculated expression from it. The expression involves indices from `idx_A` and the variable `r`.

Given:
- `b` is initially `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`
- The expression to be subtracted is `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`

After the code execution, `b` becomes:
\[ b = (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `(A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.
