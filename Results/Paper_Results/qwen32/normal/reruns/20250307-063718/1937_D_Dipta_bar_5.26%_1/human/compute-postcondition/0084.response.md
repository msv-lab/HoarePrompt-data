Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '>', `l` is not less than `r`. If `r` is 0, no further changes are made. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is greater than 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
