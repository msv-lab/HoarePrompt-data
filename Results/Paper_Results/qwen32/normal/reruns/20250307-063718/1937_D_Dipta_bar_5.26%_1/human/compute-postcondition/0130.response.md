The code snippet provided modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is initially `A[l - 1]`.

After executing `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`, the new value of `b` will be `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.**
