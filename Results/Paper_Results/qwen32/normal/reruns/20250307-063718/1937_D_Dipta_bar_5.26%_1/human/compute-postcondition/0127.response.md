Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Variable Values:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is explicitly set to the value of `n`.

### Calculation:
Given that `i` is set to `n`, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - n`, which results in `0`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of `n - i`, which is `0`, followed by a space as specified by `end=' '`.

Output: **0 **
