Output State: **`x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j)) * len(idx_B)`, `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `B` now includes the newly appended value `x`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is calculated and then appended to the list `B`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
