The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `j` to `j + 1` and ensure `n` remains the same.

Given:
- `i` is calculated as `n - 2 - j`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `j` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

No changes are needed for `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, or `s` as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**
