Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<'. If `idx_B` is an empty list, `B` becomes a list containing the value 0 and `len(idx_B)` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx_B` is not empty, `B` contains the value `x` (which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`), and `len(idx_B)` remains unchanged.**
