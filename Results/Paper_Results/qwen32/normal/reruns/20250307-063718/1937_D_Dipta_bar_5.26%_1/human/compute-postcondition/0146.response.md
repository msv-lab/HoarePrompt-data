The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
- If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `B[r]`

After executing the line `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, the value of `b` changes. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`**.
