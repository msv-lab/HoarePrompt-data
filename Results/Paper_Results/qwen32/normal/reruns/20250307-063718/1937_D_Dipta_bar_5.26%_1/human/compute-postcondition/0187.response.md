Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is updated to `(B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. Otherwise, `b` retains its original value.**
