Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing the value 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the current character at position `i` in `s` is '<', and `len(idx_B) == 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `B` now has one element, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
