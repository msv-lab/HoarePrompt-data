Postcondition: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r`, and `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
