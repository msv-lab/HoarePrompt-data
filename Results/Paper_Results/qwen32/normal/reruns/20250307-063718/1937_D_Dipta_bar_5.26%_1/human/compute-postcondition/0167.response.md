The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. This means the previous value of `b` is overwritten with this new calculation.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s` (unchanged).
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s` (unchanged).
- `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left (unchanged).
- `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left) (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `a` is `A[l]` (unchanged).
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)` (unchanged).
- `b` is now `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` (updated).

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.
