The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, if `i_prev + 1` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**

Since the specific values of `A` and `idx_A` are not affected by the loop head, we do not need to adjust them. We only need to adjust `i`.

Let's assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**

For clarity, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is 3. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**

Generalizing:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we are not given the exact value of `i_prev`, the final answer in the required format is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. `A` and `idx_A` are unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.**
