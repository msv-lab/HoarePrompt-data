Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; if `s[i] == '>'`, then `idx_A` has `i` appended to it, and if `idx_A` was empty before appending `i`, `A` has `0` appended to it, otherwise, `A` has a new element `x` appended, where `x = A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.**
