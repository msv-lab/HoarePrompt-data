The code snippet `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

Given the initial state, `A` already has elements, and `x` has been calculated based on the previous state of `A`, `i`, `idx_A`, and their respective lengths. After appending `x` to `A`, the list `A` will now have one more element.

The variables `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A` remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `A` has a new element `x` appended, where `x = A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`; `idx_A` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, except that if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` has `i` appended to it.**
