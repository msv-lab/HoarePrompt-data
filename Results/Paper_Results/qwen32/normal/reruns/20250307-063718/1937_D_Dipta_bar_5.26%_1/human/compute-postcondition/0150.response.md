The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. The values of `B`, `r`, and `n` are already defined in the initial state, and `r` is decreased by 1 before this assignment. Therefore, the value of `a` will be the element in `B` at the index `r` (which was the original value of `r` before it was decreased).

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`.**
