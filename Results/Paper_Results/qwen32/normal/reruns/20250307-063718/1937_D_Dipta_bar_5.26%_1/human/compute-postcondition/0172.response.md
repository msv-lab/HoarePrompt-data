The code snippet provided modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the value of `b` is updated as follows:
- `b` was initially `A[l - 1]`.
- After the operation, `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.

Output State: **`A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left, `idx_B` contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.**
