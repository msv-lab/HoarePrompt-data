Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state and the print statement.

### Variables and Conditions:
- **`A`**: Contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- **`idx_A`**: Contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- **`B`**: Contains cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' in `s` from right to left.
- **`idx_B`**: Contains indices of all '<' characters in `s` in decreasing order (from right to left).
- **`l`**: Initially 0, but it is mentioned that `l` is greater than `r` at the time of the print statement.
- **`r`**: Initially the length of `B` minus 1, but it is mentioned that `r` is not equal to 0 at the time of the print statement.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 0.
- **`s[i]`**: Not equal to '>'.
- **`a`**: Set to `B[r]`.
- **`b`**: Updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `a`**:
   - `a` is set to `B[r]`. Since `r` is the index of the last element in `B` (from right to left), `a` is the last cumulative value in `B`.

2. **Value of `b`**:
   - `b` is updated based on the formula `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Here, `i` is the current index in the string `s`, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the last '>' character (since `l` is greater than `r` and initially 0, `l - 1` would be a valid index for the last '>' character), and `r + 1` is the count of '<' characters from the current position to the end of the string `s`.

3. **Expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`**:
   - `a * 2`: Twice the last cumulative value in `B`.
   - `b * 2`: Twice the updated value of `b`.
   - `(n - i)`: The difference between `n` (a positive integer greater than 0) and the current index `i`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the expression, the print statement will output the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r], b is updated to b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), n is a positive integer greater than 0, and i is the current index in the string s)**
