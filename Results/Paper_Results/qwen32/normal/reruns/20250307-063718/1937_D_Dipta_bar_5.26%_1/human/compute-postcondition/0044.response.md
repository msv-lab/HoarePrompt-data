Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2 - j`
- `j` is `j + 1`

Code to Execute:
```
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `x` is assigned a new value based on the expression `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly modified by this code snippet.

Output State:
- `x` is assigned the value `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j)) * len(idx_B)`.
- `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 2 - j`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j)) * len(idx_B)`, `A` contains values calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
