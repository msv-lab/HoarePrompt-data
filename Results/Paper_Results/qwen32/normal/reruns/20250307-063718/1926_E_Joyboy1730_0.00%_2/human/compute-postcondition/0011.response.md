The provided code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` was already defined as `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `m` does not change after the execution of this line. Therefore, the state of `m` remains the same as it was defined initially. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
