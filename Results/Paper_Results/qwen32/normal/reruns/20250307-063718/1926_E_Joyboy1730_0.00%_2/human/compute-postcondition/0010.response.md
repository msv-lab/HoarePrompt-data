To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it. The `while` loop condition is `while n:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an integer read from the input
- `L` is an empty list
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

The only variable in the loop condition is `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute one more time. 

Let's analyze the transformation of `n` in the loop:
- `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`
- `n` is then updated to `n - m`, which is equivalent to `n - (n + 1) // 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero after the update. If `n` is zero after the update, the loop will terminate. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero before the update.

Let's denote the value of `n` at the end of the previous iteration as `n_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2` should not be zero. This means `n_prev` should be such that after subtracting `(n_prev + 1) // 2`, the result is still non-zero.

To ensure this, `n_prev` should be greater than 1 because:
- If `n_prev` is 1, then `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2` becomes `1 - 1` which is `0`.
- If `n_prev` is greater than 1, then `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2` will be a positive number.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
