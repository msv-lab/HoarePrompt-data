The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
