Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * `pow`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, and `a` remain as described in the initial state. The variable `n` is still 0. The execution of the `break` statement results in exiting the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables.
