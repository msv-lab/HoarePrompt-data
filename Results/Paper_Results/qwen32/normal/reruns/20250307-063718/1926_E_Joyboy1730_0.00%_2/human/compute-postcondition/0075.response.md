The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. The initial state of `pow` is 4. After executing the code, `pow` becomes 8. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `L` is a list with at least two elements; `a` is the second element in `L`; `k` is `k - tot`; `tot` is now `tot + a`; `pow` is 8.**
