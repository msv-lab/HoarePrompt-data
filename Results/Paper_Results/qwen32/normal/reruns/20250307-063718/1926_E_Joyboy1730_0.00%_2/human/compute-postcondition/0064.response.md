Output State: **`n` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `L` is a list with at least two elements; `a` is the next element in `L`; `k` is `k - a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`); `tot` is `a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`); `pow` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
