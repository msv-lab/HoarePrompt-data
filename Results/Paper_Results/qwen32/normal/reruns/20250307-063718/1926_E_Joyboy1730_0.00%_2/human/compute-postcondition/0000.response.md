Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the test cases that will be processed later.
