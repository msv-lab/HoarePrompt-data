The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by these new inputs. The variables `t`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` remains unchanged, `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`.**
