Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 8 * `pow`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a + a`, `k` is `k - (tot + a + a)`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `pow` is doubled from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial condition.
