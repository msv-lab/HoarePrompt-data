The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. However, the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, and the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

To execute one more iteration of the loop, `t` must be decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `L`, `tot`, `k`, and `pow`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` if the loop does not break, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the cumulative sum of `tot` after each iteration, and `pow` is `2` raised to the power of the number of elements in `L` if the loop does not break. If the loop breaks, `tot`, `k`, and `pow` are the values just before the loop breaks.**
