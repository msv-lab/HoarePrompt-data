Output State: **`n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `k`, `t`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `m` remain unchanged.
