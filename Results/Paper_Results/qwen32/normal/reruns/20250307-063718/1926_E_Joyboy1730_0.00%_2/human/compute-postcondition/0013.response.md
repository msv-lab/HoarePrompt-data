To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `n` is reduced by half (rounded up), as `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` and then subtracted from `n`.

The loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0. The variable `L` is not modified in the loop, so it remains an empty list. The variable `k` is read from the input but not modified in the loop, so it remains unchanged. The variable `t` is also read from the input but not modified in the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Here is the step-by-step behavior of the loop:
1. `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
2. `n` is updated to `n - m`.
3. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

Given that `n` is reduced by approximately half in each iteration, the loop will execute `log2(n)` times (rounded up). Once `n` reaches 0, the loop terminates.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `t` remains the same input integer.
- `n` becomes 0.
- `k` remains the same input integer.
- `L` remains an empty list.
- `m` is not relevant in the final state as it is recalculated in each iteration and not stored.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 0; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list.**
