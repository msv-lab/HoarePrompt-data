Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `L` is a list with at least one element, `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, `pow` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
