Postcondition: **`n` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `L` is a list with at least two elements; `a` is the next element in `L`; `k` is `k - a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`); `tot` is `a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`); `pow` is 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
