To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the provided state.

The `while` loop condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True`, and a zero integer is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is not zero.

Given the state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input
- `L` is an empty list

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. The values of `t` and `k` do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted. The list `L` is also irrelevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is not zero. Since `n` is an integer read from the input, the condition for the loop to execute is simply that `n` should be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list**
