The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `m` based on the current value of `n`. Given that `n` must be at least 2, the value of `m` will be recalculated but will not change its definition as `(n + 1) // 2`.

Since the code does not change the values of `k`, `t`, `L`, `tot`, or `pow`, these variables remain the same. The only change is in the value of `m`, which is recalculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
