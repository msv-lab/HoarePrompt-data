Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` was less than `k` and `k` was less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `tot` remains unchanged.**
