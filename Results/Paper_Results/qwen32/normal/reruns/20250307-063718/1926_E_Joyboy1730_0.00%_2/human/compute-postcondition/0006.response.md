The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
