The code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `m` is already defined as `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `m` does not change with this assignment. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
