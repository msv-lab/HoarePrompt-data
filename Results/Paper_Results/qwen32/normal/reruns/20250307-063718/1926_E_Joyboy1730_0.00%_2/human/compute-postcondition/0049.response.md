The code reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since the initial state already defines `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `m` does not change after the execution of the code. The value of `n` remains unchanged as well, and it must still be at least 2.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
