The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state indicates that `n` is 0 and `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the cumulative sum of `tot` after each iteration. However, since the code snippet only assigns new values to `n` and `k` and does not affect `t`, `L`, `tot`, or `pow`, these variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` if the loop does not break, `k` is an input integer, and `pow` is `2` raised to the power of the number of elements in `L` if the loop does not break. If the loop breaks, `tot`, `k`, and `pow` are the values just before the loop breaks.**
