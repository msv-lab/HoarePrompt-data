The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid. The value of `m` is recalculated based on the new value of `n` in subsequent operations, but for this specific step, `m` is not changed.

Output State: **`n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
