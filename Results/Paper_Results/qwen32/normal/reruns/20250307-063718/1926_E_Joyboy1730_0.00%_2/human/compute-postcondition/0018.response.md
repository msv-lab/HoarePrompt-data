Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an integer read from the input.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.
- `pow` is 1.

The print statement is:

```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is an integer read from the input, but its exact value is not provided.

Given these, let's determine the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`:
- Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to `1 * (2 * k - 1)`, which is `2 * k - 1`.

Thus, the print statement will output `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the integer read from the input.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
