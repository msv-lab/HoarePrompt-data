To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables.

### Initial State
1. `n` is 0.
2. `t` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, so we'll ignore it for this calculation).
3. `L` is a list with at least two elements.
4. `a` is the next element in `L`.
5. `k` is `k - a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`).
6. `tot` is `a` (where `a` is the new value from `L`).
7. `pow` is 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization and Assignment:**
   - `a` is assigned the value of the next element in `L`. Let's denote this value as `L[0]` (the first element of `L`).
   - `k` is initially not defined, but after the assignment, `k` becomes `k - a`. Since the initial value of `k` is not provided, we'll denote the initial `k` as `k_initial`. Therefore, `k` becomes `k_initial - L[0]`.
   - `tot` is assigned the value of `a`, which is `L[0]`.
   - `pow` is set to 2.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow` is 2.
     - `k` is `k_initial - L[0]`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes:
     \[
     2 * (2 * (k_{\text{initial}} - L[0]) - 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     2 * (2k_{\text{initial}} - 2L[0] - 1)
     \]

### Output
Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2 * (2 * (k_initial - L[0]) - 1) (where k_initial is the initial value of k and L[0] is the first element of the list L)**
