Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4 * `pow`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a + a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `tot` is now the sum of its previous value and `a` added twice. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
