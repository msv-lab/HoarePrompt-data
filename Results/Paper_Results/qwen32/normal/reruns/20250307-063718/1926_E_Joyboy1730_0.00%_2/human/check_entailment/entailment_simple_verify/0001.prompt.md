You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to simulate the process of laying down cards according to specific rules and determine the k-th card in the sequence. The sequence is constructed by first placing all odd-numbered cards, then all cards that are twice an odd number, then all cards that are 3 times an odd number, and so on, until all cards are placed.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem, but there are several issues with its implementation:

1. **Initialization and Loop**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L` and a variable `n` which is supposed to represent the number of cards.
   - It then enters a while loop that reduces `n` by half in each iteration, but it does not populate `L` with any values. This loop seems intended to calculate the number of odd multiples of each power of 2, but it does not do so correctly.

2. **Processing the List `L`**:
   - The program iterates over an empty list `L` and attempts to determine the k-th card based on the values in `L`. Since `L` is never populated, this part of the code will not work as intended.

3. **Printing the k-th Card**:
   - The program calculates the k-th card based on the incorrect values in `L` and prints it. However, since `L` is empty, this calculation will not yield the correct result.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of odd multiples of each power of 2.
2. Determine which group the k-th card falls into.
3. Calculate the exact position of the k-th card within that group.

### Correctness of the Program
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The list `L` is never populated, and the logic for determining the k-th card is flawed.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
