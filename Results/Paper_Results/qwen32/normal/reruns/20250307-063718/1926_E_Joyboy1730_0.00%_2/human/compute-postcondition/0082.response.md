The value of `n` is decreased by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
