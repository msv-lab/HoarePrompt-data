Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `k` is the second input integer minus `tot`, `t` is 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot + a` (if the loop did not break), `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
