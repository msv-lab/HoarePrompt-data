The value of `pow` is doubled. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `t` is 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is now `2 * pow`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `t` is 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is `4`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
