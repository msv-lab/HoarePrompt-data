The code snippet provided is `m = (n + 1) // 2`. This line reassigns the value of `m` based on the current value of `n`. The value of `m` is now calculated as the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.

Given that `m` was previously defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, reassigning it with the same expression does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `m` remains the same as it was initially.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be a non-zero value; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
