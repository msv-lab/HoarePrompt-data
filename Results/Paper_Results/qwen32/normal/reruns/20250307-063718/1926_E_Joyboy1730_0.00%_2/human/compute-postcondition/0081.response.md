The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`k`, `t`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
