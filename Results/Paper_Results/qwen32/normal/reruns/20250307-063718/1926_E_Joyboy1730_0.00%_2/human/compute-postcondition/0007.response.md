The loop condition is `while n:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an integer read from the input
- `L` is an empty list
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The value of `n` after the previous iteration is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. To make sure `n` is non-zero for the next iteration, we need to adjust `n` to be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be a non-zero value; `k` is an integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
