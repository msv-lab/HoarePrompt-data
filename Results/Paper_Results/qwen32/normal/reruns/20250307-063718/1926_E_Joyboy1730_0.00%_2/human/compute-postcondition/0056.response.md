Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `t` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `L` is a list with at least one element (its specific elements are not provided).
- `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is used in the print statement).
- `tot` is 0 and `tot < k`.
- `pow` is 1.
- `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (the value of `a` is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is not explicitly given, but we know that `tot < k` and `tot` is 0, so `k` must be greater than 0.
- The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is a value greater than 0 (since `tot < k` and `tot` is 0).

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is a value greater than 0)**
