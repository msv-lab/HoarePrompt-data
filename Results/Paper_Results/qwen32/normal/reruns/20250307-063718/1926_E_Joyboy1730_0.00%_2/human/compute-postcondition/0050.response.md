Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` was at least 2 initially, after the operation, `n` will be at least 1. The value of `m` remains as it was defined, which is `(n + 1) // 2` before the decrement operation.
