The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` is initially equal to `a`, so after the operation, `tot` becomes `a + a` or `2 * a`.

Other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions:
- `n` is still 0.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `L` is still a list with at least two elements.
- `a` is still the next element in `L`.
- `k` is still `k - a`.
- The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` remains the same, but now `tot` is `2 * a`.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `L` is a list with at least two elements; `a` is the next element in `L`; `k` is `k - a`; `tot` is `2 * a`; `pow` is 2. If `2 * a < k and k <= 3 * a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
