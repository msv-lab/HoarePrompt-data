The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `tot`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `tot` and `pow` remain unchanged. `tot` is increased by `a`.
