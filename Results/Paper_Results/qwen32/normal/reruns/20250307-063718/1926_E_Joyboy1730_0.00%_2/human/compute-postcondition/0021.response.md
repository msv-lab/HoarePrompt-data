Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `tot` and `pow` remain unchanged. `tot` is increased by `a`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tot` is now `tot + a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
