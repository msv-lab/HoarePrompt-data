The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the state description and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t`.

State: **`n` is 0; `t` is 1; `L` remains unchanged; `k` is `k - sum_L`; `tot` is `sum_L`; `pow` is `2^len_L`.**
