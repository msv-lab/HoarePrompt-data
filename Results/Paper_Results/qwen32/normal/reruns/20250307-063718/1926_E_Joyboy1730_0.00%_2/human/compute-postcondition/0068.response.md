The code snippet multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `pow` is 2, so after the operation, `pow` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `L` is a list with at least two elements; `a` is the next element in `L`; `k` is `k - 2 * a`; `tot` is `2 * a`; `pow` is 4**.
