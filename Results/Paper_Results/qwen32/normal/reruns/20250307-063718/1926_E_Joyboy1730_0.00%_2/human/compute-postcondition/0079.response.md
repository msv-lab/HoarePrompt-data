The code snippet provided sets `L` to an empty list. This change affects the variable `L` directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is `sum_L`, `pow` is `2^len_L`.**

In natural language: The variable `L` is now an empty list, while `n`, `k`, `t`, `tot`, and `pow` retain their initial values.
