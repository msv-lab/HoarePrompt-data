Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `X` is `A // 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `X` has been updated to be the integer division of `A` by 2. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `A`, `B`, and `C`) remain unchanged.
