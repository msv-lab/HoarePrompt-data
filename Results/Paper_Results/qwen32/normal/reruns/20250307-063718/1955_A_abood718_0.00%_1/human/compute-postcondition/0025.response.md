Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`, but `i` is not used in the print statement.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but `t` is also not used in the print statement.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, but these variables are also not used in the print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement calculates the value of `A * C / 2` and then converts the result to an integer using `int()`.
- The value of `A` and `C` are read from the input, and their specific values are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer part of the division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
