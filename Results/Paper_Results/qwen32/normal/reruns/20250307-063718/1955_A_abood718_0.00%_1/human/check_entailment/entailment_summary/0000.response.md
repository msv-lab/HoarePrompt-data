Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. 

However, there are some issues in the logic of the program:

1. The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct, meaning if the cost of buying two yogurts at regular price is less than the promotional price, then the regular price should be used. However, `B` should be `a` and `C` should be `b` in the code.

2. The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is also correct, meaning if the number of yogurts `n` is even, then the total cost is simply `n * b / 2`. However, again, `A` should be `n` and `C` should be `b` in the code.

3. The `else` block is incorrect. It should calculate the cost for an odd number of yogurts. The correct logic should be to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The correct calculation should be `X = n // 2` pairs at `b` burles each plus one yogurt at `a` burles, resulting in `X * b + a`.

The current implementation incorrectly prints `X` in the `else` block, which does not contribute to the final cost calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the `else` block:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X * C + B)
```
But the first two conditions should also be corrected as mentioned.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all scenarios, particularly for the odd number of yogurts case.

Correctness: **False**
