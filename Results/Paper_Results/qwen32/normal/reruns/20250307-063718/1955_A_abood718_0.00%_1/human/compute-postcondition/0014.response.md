The provided code snippet reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. No further operations are performed in the provided snippet, so the state of the variables remains as per the input. The conditions and operations that follow (checking `B * 2 < C` and setting `X` or `i`) are not part of the given code snippet and thus do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, and the input value for the loop must be at least 1.**
