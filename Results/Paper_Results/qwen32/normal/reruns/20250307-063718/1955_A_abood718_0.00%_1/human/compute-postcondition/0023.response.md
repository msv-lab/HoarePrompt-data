The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. This means the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated based on the input, while the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.**
