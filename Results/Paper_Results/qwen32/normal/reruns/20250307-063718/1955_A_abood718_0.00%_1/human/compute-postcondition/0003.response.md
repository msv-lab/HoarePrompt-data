To determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement, we need to understand the values of `A` and `B` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
2. **n, a, b**: For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
3. **A, B, C**: Integers read from the input.
4. **B * 2 < C**: A condition that must be satisfied for the current value of `B`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `A` is directly read from the input.
- The value of `B` is also directly read from the input and must satisfy the condition `B * 2 < C`.
- The value of `C` is read from the input but is not used in the `print(A * B)` statement.

### Print Statement:
The statement `print(A * B)` will output the product of `A` and `B`.

### Output Description:
Given the precondition, we know the values of `A` and `B` are explicitly read from the input, and `B` satisfies the condition `B * 2 < C`. However, the exact numerical values of `A` and `B` are not provided in the initial state, so we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input and B satisfies the condition B * 2 < C)**
