Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the last `else` block. Specifically, when the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) twice and then prints the final result. This will cause the program to output multiple lines for a single test case, which is not expected according to the problem description.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)  # This print statement is incorrect and should be removed
    print(X * C + B)
```

To fix the code, the print statement for `X` should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

This corrected version will ensure that for each test case, only one line of output is printed, as required by the problem description.
