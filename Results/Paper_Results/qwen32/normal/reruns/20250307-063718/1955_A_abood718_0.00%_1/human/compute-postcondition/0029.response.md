Postcondition: **`i` is `k + 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. If `A` is even, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
