The given code snippet is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Based on the initial state provided:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
- The input value for the loop must be at least 1.

From the code snippet, the expression `int(A * C / 2)` is evaluated and printed. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Multiplication**: The values of `A` and `C` are multiplied together.
2. **Division**: The result of the multiplication is divided by 2.
3. **Integer Conversion**: The result of the division is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

The expression `int(A * C / 2)` computes half of the product of `A` and `C`, and the result is truncated to the nearest integer.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
