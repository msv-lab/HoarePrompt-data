Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts (A) is odd. Specifically, it incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the total cost. Additionally, the calculation for the total cost when A is odd is not correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 <= C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            Y = A % 2
            print(X * C + Y * B)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is not cheaper than buying them individually (`B * 2 <= C`), then we simply buy all yogurts individually.
- Otherwise, we buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible (`X = A // 2`), and if there's one yogurt left over (`Y = A % 2`), we buy it individually. The total cost is `X * C + Y * B`.
