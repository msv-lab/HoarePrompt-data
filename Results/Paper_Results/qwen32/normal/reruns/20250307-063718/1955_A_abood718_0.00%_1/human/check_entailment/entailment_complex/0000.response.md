### Reasoning:

The provided function is intended to compute the minimum cost for purchasing `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than using the promotion, so the cost is simply `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b`, so the cost is `(n // 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the function calculates the cost by buying `(n // 2)` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price `b` and one additional yogurt at the regular price `a`. The cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually than in pairs.
   - It correctly handles both even and odd values of `n`.

### Analysis of Provided Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
  - Since `2*5 < 9`, the function should output `2*5 = 10`, but the expected output is `9`. This indicates an error in the logic for this specific case.
  
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, the function should output `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 4 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, the function should output `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`, but the expected output is `15`. This indicates an error in the logic for this specific case.
  
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, the function should output `(4 // 2) * 11 = 2 * 11 = 22`, but the expected output is `20`. This indicates an error in the logic for this specific case.

### Correctness:

The function logic is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if a * 2 <= b` to correctly handle cases where buying two yogurts individually is not more expensive than the promotion. Additionally, the logic for handling odd `n` should be corrected.

### Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all test cases as per the problem description.
