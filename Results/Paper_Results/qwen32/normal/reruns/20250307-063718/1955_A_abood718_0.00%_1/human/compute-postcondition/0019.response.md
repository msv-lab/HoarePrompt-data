Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30 (these variables are also not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore them for this task).
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the value of `X`:**
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer part of the division of `A` by 2.
   - For example, if `A` is 5, then `X` will be 2 (since 5 // 2 = 2).
   - If `A` is 8, then `X` will be 4 (since 8 // 2 = 4).

2. **Calculate `X * C`:**
   - Once we have the value of `X`, we multiply it by `C`.
   - For example, if `X` is 2 and `C` is 3, then `X * C` will be 6 (since 2 * 3 = 6).

3. **Add `B` to `X * C`:**
   - Finally, we add the value of `B` to the result of `X * C`.
   - For example, if `X * C` is 6 and `B` is 4, then `X * C + B` will be 10 (since 6 + 4 = 10).

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Thus, the final output can be described as:
Output: **X * C + B (where X is A // 2, C is the given integer, and B is the given integer)**
