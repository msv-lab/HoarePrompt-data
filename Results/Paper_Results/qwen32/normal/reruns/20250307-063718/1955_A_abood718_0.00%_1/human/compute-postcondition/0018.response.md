To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(X)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `X` is defined as the integer division of `A` by 2 (`A // 2`).
- Integer division in Python means that the result is the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
- The exact value of `A` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical value of `X`.
- However, we know that `X` is half of `A`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Output:
Based on the given information, the print statement will output the value of `X`, which is `A // 2`.

Output: **X (where X is A // 2)**
