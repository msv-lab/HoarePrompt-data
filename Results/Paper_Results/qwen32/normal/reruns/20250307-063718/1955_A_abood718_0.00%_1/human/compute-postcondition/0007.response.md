Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, and the input value for the loop must be at least 1; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. Additionally, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. `A` is an odd integer.**
