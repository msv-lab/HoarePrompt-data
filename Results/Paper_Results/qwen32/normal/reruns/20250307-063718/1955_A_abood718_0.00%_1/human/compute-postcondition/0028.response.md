To determine what will be printed by the `print(X * C + B)` statement, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the initial state:

1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `i` is defined as `k + 1`, but `k` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore `i` for this specific print statement.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it is also not directly used in the print statement.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, but these variables are not used in the print statement either.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

2. **Expression to be evaluated:**
   - The expression to be evaluated in the print statement is `X * C + B`.
   - Substituting `X` with `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

3. **Output description:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.
   - Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input, the final result will be an integer.

Given the initial state, we can conclude that the output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
