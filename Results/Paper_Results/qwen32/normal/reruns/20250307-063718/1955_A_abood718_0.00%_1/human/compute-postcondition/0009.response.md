To determine what will be printed by the `print(X)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the definition of the variable `X`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `A` is an odd integer.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`.

Since `A` is an odd integer, dividing it by 2 using integer division (`//`) will yield the floor division result, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division. For any odd integer `A`, `A // 2` will be the integer part of `A / 2`, effectively removing the fractional part and discarding the remainder.

For example:
- If `A` is 5, then `A // 2` is 2.
- If `A` is 7, then `A // 2` is 3.

Given that `A` is an odd integer, `X` will be the integer part of `A` divided by 2.

Since the exact value of `A` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `X`. However, we know that `X` will be the integer part of `A / 2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(X)` statement will be the integer part of `A / 2`.

Output: **X (where X is the integer part of A / 2 and A is an odd integer)**
