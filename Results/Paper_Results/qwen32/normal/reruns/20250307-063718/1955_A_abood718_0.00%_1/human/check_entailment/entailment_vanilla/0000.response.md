Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (b) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (2a), it is cheaper to buy two yogurts as a pair.
   - Otherwise, buying them individually is cheaper.

2. **Buying Strategy**:
   - If `n` is even, buying pairs of yogurts will always be optimal if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - If `n` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has a few issues:
1. **Condition to Buy Pairs**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. However, the correct condition should be `if C < B * 2` to check if the promotion is cheaper.
   
2. **Handling Odd Numbers**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and adds the cost of the remaining yogurt (`B`) if `A` is odd.
   - However, the line `print(X)` is incorrect and should be removed. It prints an intermediate value instead of the final cost.

3. **Correct Output**:
   - When `n` is even and the promotion is cheaper, the cost should be `(A // 2) * C`.
   - When `n` is odd and the promotion is cheaper, the cost should be `((A // 2) * C) + B`.
   - When `n` is even and buying individually is cheaper, the cost should be `A * B`.
   - When `n` is odd and buying individually is cheaper, the cost should be `A * B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if C < B * 2:
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print((A // 2) * C)
            else:
                X = A // 2
                print(X * C + B)
        else:
            print(A * B)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in the conditions and unnecessary print statements. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
