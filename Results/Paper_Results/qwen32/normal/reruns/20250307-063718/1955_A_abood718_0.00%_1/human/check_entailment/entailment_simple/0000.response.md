Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. Let's go through the logic and the provided code step-by-step.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price for one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - If `b * 2 < c`, the program incorrectly checks this condition. The correct condition should be `a * 2 < b` to see if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion.
   - If `n` is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n * b / 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program incorrectly calculates the cost. It should calculate the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a` to account for the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and the regular price for the remaining yogurt.

3. **Corrected Logic:**
   - For each test case, calculate the minimum cost as follows:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the remaining single yogurt `remaining = n % 2`.
     - The total cost is `pairs * b + remaining * a`.

Let's correct the code based on the above reasoning:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)

#State: The loop will have printed the results for each of the `t` test cases based on the corrected conditions provided.
```

The original program has logical errors and does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all cases. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
