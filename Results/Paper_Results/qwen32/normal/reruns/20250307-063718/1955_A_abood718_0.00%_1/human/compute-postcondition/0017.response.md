The code snippet `X = A // 2` performs integer division of `A` by 2 and assigns the result to `X`. This means `X` will be the floor value of `A` divided by 2.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `X`, which is now equal to `A // 2`. The other variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `X` is `A // 2`.**
