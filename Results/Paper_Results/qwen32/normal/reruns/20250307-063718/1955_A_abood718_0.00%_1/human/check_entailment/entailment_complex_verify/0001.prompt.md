You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop will have printed the results for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on specific conditions involving the integers. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases, without altering the input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (b) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (2a), it is cheaper to buy two yogurts as a pair.
   - Otherwise, buying them individually is cheaper.

2. **Buying Strategy**:
   - If `n` is even, buying pairs of yogurts will always be optimal if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - If `n` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has a few issues:
1. **Condition to Buy Pairs**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. However, the correct condition should be `if C < B * 2` to check if the promotion is cheaper.
   
2. **Handling Odd Numbers**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and adds the cost of the remaining yogurt (`B`) if `A` is odd.
   - However, the line `print(X)` is incorrect and should be removed. It prints an intermediate value instead of the final cost.

3. **Correct Output**:
   - When `n` is even and the promotion is cheaper, the cost should be `(A // 2) * C`.
   - When `n` is odd and the promotion is cheaper, the cost should be `((A // 2) * C) + B`.
   - When `n` is even and buying individually is cheaper, the cost should be `A * B`.
   - When `n` is odd and buying individually is cheaper, the cost should be `A * B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if C < B * 2:
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print((A // 2) * C)
            else:
                X = A // 2
                print(X * C + B)
        else:
            print(A * B)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in the conditions and unnecessary print statements. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
