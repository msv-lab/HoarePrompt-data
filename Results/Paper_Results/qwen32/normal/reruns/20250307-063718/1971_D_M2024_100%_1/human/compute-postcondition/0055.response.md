The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. Since the loop runs `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. If `cut0` is 0, there are no occurrences of a '0' followed by a '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`. Otherwise, `cut0` is greater than 0 and represents the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `a`, while `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`.**
