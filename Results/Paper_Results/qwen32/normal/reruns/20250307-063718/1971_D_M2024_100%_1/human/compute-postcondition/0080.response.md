To determine what will be printed by the `print(cut0 + cut1)` statement, we need to understand the values of `cut0` and `cut1` based on the given initial state.

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499. This variable is not directly relevant to the calculation of `cut0` and `cut1`.
- `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Again, this variable is not directly relevant to the calculation of `cut0` and `cut1`.
- `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. This string is crucial for determining the values of `cut0` and `cut1`.
- `cut0` is the number of '01' transitions in `a`. This means `cut0` counts how many times the sequence '01' appears in `a`.
- `cut1` is the number of '10' transitions in `a`. This means `cut1` counts how many times the sequence '10' appears in `a`.
- `cut0` is not equal to 0, meaning there is at least one '01' transition in the string `a`.

The print statement `print(cut0 + cut1)` will output the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`. Since `cut0` counts '01' transitions and `cut1` counts '10' transitions, their sum represents the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `a`.

Given the initial state, we know that `cut0` is at least 1 (since `cut0` is not equal to 0), and `cut1` can be any non-negative integer depending on the string `a`.

The exact value of `cut0 + cut1` cannot be determined without knowing the specific string `a`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the string `a`.

Output: **cut0 + cut1 (where cut0 is the number of '01' transitions in the string `a` and cut1 is the number of '10' transitions in the string `a`)**
