Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cut0` is the number of '01' transitions in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of '10' transitions in `a`. If `cut0` equals 0, then `cut0` remains 0; otherwise, `cut0` is not equal to 0.**
