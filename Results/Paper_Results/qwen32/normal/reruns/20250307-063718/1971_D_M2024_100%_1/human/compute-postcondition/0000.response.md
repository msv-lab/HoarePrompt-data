The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 500. The code then reassigns `t` to the integer value of the input, which does not change the fact that `t` is still an integer within the specified range. The string `s` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.**
