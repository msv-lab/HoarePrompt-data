Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are within the bounds of `a`. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged. `cut0` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cut0` has increased by 1, while the conditions and values related to `i` and `cut1` remain as they were initially described.
