Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1; otherwise, `cut1` is 0.**
