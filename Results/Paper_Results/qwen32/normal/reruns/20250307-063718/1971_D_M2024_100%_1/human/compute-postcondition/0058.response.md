Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cut1` has been explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `s`, `a`, and `cut0` remain unchanged.
