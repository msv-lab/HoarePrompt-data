The value of `cut1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**
