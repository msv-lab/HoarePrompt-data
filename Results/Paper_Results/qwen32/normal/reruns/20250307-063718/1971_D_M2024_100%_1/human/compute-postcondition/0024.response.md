To determine what will be printed by the `print(cut1 + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
- `a` is a string of length at least 2.
- `cut0` is 0.
- `cut1` is the total number of '10' transitions in the string `a`.

### Analysis:
The variable `cut1` is specifically defined as the total number of '10' transitions in the string `a`. The `print` statement outputs the value of `cut1 + 1`.

Since `cut1` is the count of '10' transitions in the string `a`, the value of `cut1` depends on the specific sequence of characters in `a`. However, we do not have the exact sequence of `a` provided, so we can only express the output in terms of `cut1`.

### Output Calculation:
Given that `cut1` is the number of '10' transitions in `a`, the expression `cut1 + 1` will be one more than the number of '10' transitions in `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output `cut1 + 1`, which is one more than the number of '10' transitions in the string `a`.

Output: **cut1 + 1 (where cut1 is the number of '10' transitions in the string `a`)**
