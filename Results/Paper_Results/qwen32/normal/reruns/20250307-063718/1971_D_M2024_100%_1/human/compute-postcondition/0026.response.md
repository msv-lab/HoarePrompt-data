To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and analyze the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer between 1 and 500. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value does not affect the output.

2. **String `s`**: This is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Again, `s` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value does not affect the output.

3. **String `a`**: This is a string of length at least 2. The exact content of `a` is not provided, but we know its length is at least 2.

4. **Variable `cut0`**: This is the total number of '01' transitions in the string `a`. A '01' transition occurs wherever a '0' is immediately followed by a '1' in the string `a`.

5. **Variable `cut1`**: This is the total number of '10' transitions in the string `a`. A '10' transition occurs wherever a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

6. **Condition**: It is given that `cut0` is not equal to 0, meaning there is at least one '01' transition in the string `a`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(cut0 + cut1)
```
This statement prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, which are the counts of '01' and '10' transitions in the string `a`, respectively.

Since the exact content of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `cut0` and `cut1`. However, we know that the output will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **cut0 + cut1 (where cut0 is the number of '01' transitions and cut1 is the number of '10' transitions in the string `a`)**
