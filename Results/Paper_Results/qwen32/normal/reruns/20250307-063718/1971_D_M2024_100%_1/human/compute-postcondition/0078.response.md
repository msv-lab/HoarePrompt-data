To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their meanings**:
   - `t`: An integer between 0 and 499.
   - `s`: A string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `a`: A string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `cut0`: The number of '01' transitions in `a`. Given that `cut0` equals 0, this means there are no '01' transitions in `a`.
   - `cut1`: The number of '10' transitions in `a`.

2. **Understanding `cut0` and `cut1`**:
   - Since `cut0` is 0, `a` does not contain any '01' transitions. This implies that all '0's in `a` are either at the beginning or are not followed by a '1'.
   - `cut1` counts the number of '10' transitions in `a`. Since `cut0` is 0, `a` could be composed of blocks of '1's followed by blocks of '0's, or vice versa, but there are no '01' transitions to separate these blocks.

3. **Determine the value of `cut1 + 1`**:
   - The value of `cut1` depends on the structure of `a`. However, since there are no '01' transitions, `a` can be a string that consists of a block of '1's followed by a block of '0's or vice versa, or it could be entirely '0's or entirely '1's.
   - If `a` is entirely '0's or entirely '1's, `cut1` would be 0 because there are no '10' transitions.
   - If `a` starts with '1's and ends with '0's, there will be exactly one '10' transition, making `cut1` equal to 1.
   - If `a` starts with '0's and ends with '1's, there will be exactly one '10' transition, making `cut1` equal to 1.
   - If `a` has multiple blocks of '1's and '0's, `cut1` will be the number of times '1' is followed by '0'.

However, regardless of the specific structure of `a`, the problem states that `cut0` is 0, which simplifies our analysis. The only way for `cut0` to be 0 is if `a` does not have any '01' transitions, meaning `a` can be structured in such a way that `cut1` is either 0 or more, but the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of '10' transitions. 

Given that `cut0` is 0, the simplest case to consider is when `a` is either all '0's or all '1's, which would make `cut1` equal to 0. Therefore, `cut1 + 1` would be 1.

Output: **1**
