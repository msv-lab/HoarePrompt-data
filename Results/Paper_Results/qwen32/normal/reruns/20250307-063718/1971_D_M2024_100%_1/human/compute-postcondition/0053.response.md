To determine the output of the `print(cut0 + cut1)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their Descriptions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. This string is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
   - `cut0` is the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in the string `a`.
   - `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.
   - It is given that `cut0` is greater than 0.

2. **What `cut0` and `cut1` Represent:**
   - `cut0` counts the transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `a`.
   - `cut1` counts the transitions from '1' to '0' in the string `a`.

3. **Sum of `cut0` and `cut1`:**
   - The expression `cut0 + cut1` represents the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `a`, regardless of the direction of the transition.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `cut0` and `cut1` are both counts of transitions in the string `a`, their sum (`cut0 + cut1`) will be the total number of times the character in the string `a` changes from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print(cut0 + cut1)` statement will be the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `a`.

Output: **cut0 + cut1 (where cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`)**
