Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 2`, `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are within the bounds of `a`. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cut0` remains unchanged.**
