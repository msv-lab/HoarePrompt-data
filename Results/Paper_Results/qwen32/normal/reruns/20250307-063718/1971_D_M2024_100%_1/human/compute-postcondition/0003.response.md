The given code snippet only initializes a variable `cut0` to 0 and does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is the input string, `cut0` is 0.**
