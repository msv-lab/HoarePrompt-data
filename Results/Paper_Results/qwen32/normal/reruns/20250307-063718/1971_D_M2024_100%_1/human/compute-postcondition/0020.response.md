The code snippet `cut0 += 1` increments the value of `cut0` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, `cut1`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is `cut0` + 1, `cut1` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` remains 0, `i` is 0.**
