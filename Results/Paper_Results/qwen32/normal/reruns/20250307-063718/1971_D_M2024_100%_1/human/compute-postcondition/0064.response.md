Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0, `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', therefore `cut1` is 0, `cut0` is 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
