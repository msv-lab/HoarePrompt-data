Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut0 = 0
    cut1 = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut1 += 1
        if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
            cut0 += 1
    if cut0 == 0:
        print(cut1 + 1)
    else:
        print(cut0 + cut1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is the total number of '01' transitions in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the total number of '10' transitions in the string `a`. If `cut0` is 0, then `cut1` is the total number of '10' transitions in `a`. Otherwise, `cut0` is not equal to 0 and represents the total number of '01' transitions in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. If `cut0` is 0, there are no occurrences of a '0' followed by a '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`. Otherwise, `cut0` is greater than 0 and represents the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `a`, while `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cut0` is the number of '01' transitions in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of '10' transitions in `a`. If `cut0` equals 0, then `cut0` remains 0; otherwise, `cut0` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
