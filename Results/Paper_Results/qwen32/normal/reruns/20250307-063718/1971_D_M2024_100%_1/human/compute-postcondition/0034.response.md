The code snippet `cut1 += 1` increments the value of `cut1` by 1. The previous value of `cut1` is 0, so after the increment, `cut1` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, and the specific characters in `a` at indices `i` and `i + 1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1. The current character at index `i` in `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '0'.**
