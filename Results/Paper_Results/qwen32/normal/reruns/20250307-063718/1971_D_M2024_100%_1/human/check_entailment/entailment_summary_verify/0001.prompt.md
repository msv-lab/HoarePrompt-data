You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each string, it calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' plus one if there are no '01' transitions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and verify if it accurately computes the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string must be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Transitions:** The critical points in the string are where transitions from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1' occur. These transitions indicate where cuts are necessary to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted order.
2. **Counting Cuts:** 
   - **'1' to '0' Transition:** This indicates a necessary cut to separate a '1' from a '0' that should come before it in a sorted string.
   - **'0' to '1' Transition:** This indicates a necessary cut to separate a '0' from a '1' that should come after it in a sorted string.
3. **Final Piece:** Regardless of the transitions, the final piece will always be complete, so we need to add one to the total count of cuts to get the number of pieces.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:** The program initializes `cut0` and `cut1` to zero. These variables will count the number of '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' transitions respectively.
2. **Loop Through String:** The program iterates through the string and increments `cut1` for each '1' to '0' transition and `cut0` for each '0' to '1' transition.
3. **Determine Pieces:**
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the string is either all '0's or all '1's, or it transitions from '1's to '0's consecutively. In this case, the number of pieces is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If there are '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 > 0`), the number of pieces is simply the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1:** `11010`
   - Transitions: '1' to '0' (2 times), '0' to '1' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut1 + cut0 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4` (Incorrect, should be 3)
2. **Example 2:** `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
3. **Example 3:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
4. **Example 4:** `10`
   - Transitions: '1' to '0' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)
5. **Example 5:** `0001111`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
6. **Example 6:** `0110`
   - Transitions: '0' to '1' (1 time), '1' to '0' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for counting transitions and determining the number of pieces is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if cut0 == 0` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the need to add one piece even when there are no '0' to '1' transitions, but there are '1' to '0' transitions.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, as seen in the first example. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
