Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2. If the current character at index `i` in `a` is '0' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '1', then `cut1` is 0 and `cut0` is 1. Otherwise, `cut1` remains 0 and `cut0` remains 0.**
