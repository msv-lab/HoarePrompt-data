Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is 1, and `cut1` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `cut1` remains 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1' for some index `i`.**

In natural language: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, so `cut0` is now 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `a`, and `cut1` remain unchanged.
