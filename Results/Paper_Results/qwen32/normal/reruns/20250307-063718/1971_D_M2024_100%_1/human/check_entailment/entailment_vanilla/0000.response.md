To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and verify if it accurately computes the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string must be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Transitions:** The critical points in the string are where transitions from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1' occur. These transitions indicate where cuts are necessary to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted order.
2. **Counting Cuts:** 
   - **'1' to '0' Transition:** This indicates a necessary cut to separate a '1' from a '0' that should come before it in a sorted string.
   - **'0' to '1' Transition:** This indicates a necessary cut to separate a '0' from a '1' that should come after it in a sorted string.
3. **Final Piece:** Regardless of the transitions, the final piece will always be complete, so we need to add one to the total count of cuts to get the number of pieces.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:** The program initializes `cut0` and `cut1` to zero. These variables will count the number of '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' transitions respectively.
2. **Loop Through String:** The program iterates through the string and increments `cut1` for each '1' to '0' transition and `cut0` for each '0' to '1' transition.
3. **Determine Pieces:**
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the string is either all '0's or all '1's, or it transitions from '1's to '0's consecutively. In this case, the number of pieces is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If there are '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 > 0`), the number of pieces is simply the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1:** `11010`
   - Transitions: '1' to '0' (2 times), '0' to '1' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut1 + cut0 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4` (Incorrect, should be 3)
2. **Example 2:** `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
3. **Example 3:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
4. **Example 4:** `10`
   - Transitions: '1' to '0' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)
5. **Example 5:** `0001111`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces: `1` (Correct)
6. **Example 6:** `0110`
   - Transitions: '0' to '1' (1 time), '1' to '0' (1 time)
   - Pieces: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for counting transitions and determining the number of pieces is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if cut0 == 0` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the need to add one piece even when there are no '0' to '1' transitions, but there are '1' to '0' transitions.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, as seen in the first example. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
