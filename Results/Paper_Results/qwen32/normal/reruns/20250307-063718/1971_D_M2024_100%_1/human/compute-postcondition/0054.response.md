Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. If `cut0` is 0, there are no occurrences of a '0' followed by a '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`. Otherwise, `cut0` is greater than 0 and represents the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `a`, while `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`.***
