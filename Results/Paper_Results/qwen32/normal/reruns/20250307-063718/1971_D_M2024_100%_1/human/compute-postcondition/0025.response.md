Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is the total number of '01' transitions in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the total number of '10' transitions in the string `a`. Additionally, `cut0` is not equal to 0.**
