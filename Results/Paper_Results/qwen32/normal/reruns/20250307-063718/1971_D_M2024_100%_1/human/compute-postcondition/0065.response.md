Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut1` is 0 and `cut0` is 1. Otherwise, `cut1` retains its original value and `cut0` is not defined.**
