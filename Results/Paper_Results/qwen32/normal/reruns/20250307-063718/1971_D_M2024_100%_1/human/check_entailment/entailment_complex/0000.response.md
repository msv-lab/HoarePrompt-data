### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The key observation is that each transition from '1' to '0' (denoted as `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (denoted as `cut0`) indicates a point where the string needs to be cut to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the front and all '1's to the back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Count Transitions:**
   - Count the number of '10' transitions (`cut1`).
   - Count the number of '01' transitions (`cut0`).

2. **Determine Minimum Cuts:**
   - If there are no '01' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted by making just one additional cut (if necessary). Hence, the result is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If there are '01' transitions (`cut0 > 0`), the number of cuts needed is the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (either all '0's or all '1's), then `cut0` and `cut1` will both be zero, and the result will be `1` (since no cuts are needed).
   - If the string alternates between '0' and '1' (e.g., "0101"), `cut0` and `cut1` will each be equal to the number of transitions, and the result will be the sum of these transitions.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It iterates through each test case, counts the transitions, and prints the required number of pieces based on the conditions described.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the minimum number of pieces needed for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
