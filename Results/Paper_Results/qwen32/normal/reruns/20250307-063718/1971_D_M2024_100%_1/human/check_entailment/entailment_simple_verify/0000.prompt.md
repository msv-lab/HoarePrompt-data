You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)

If `cut0` equals 0, then the output is `cut1 + 1`; otherwise, the output is `cut0 + cut1`. This process is repeated `t` times, with `t` starting from the initial value and decremented by 1 after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a binary string. For each string, it counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1'. It then calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Here is the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

### Correctness Check

The logic of the program is as follows:
- For each test case, it counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`).
- If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string either contains only '1's or only '0's, or it is already sorted with all '0's followed by all '1's. In this case, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
- Otherwise, the number of pieces needed is the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test case: "11010"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 2 times
     - '0' to '1': 1 time
   - `cut1 = 2`, `cut0 = 1`
   - Since `cut0` is not 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`. This matches the expected output.

2. **Test case: "00000000"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 0 times
     - '0' to '1': 0 times
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Since `cut0` is 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. This matches the expected output.

3. **Test case: "1"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 0 times
     - '0' to '1': 0 times
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Since `cut0` is 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. This matches the expected output.

4. **Test case: "10"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 1 time
     - '0' to '1': 0 times
   - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Since `cut0` is 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. This matches the expected output.

5. **Test case: "0001111"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 0 times
     - '0' to '1': 1 time
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 1`
   - Since `cut0` is not 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 0 = 1`. This matches the expected output.

6. **Test case: "0110"**
   - Transitions:
     - '1' to '0': 1 time
     - '0' to '1': 1 time
   - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 1`
   - Since `cut0` is not 0, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed for all the provided test cases. The logic seems to be sound, as it correctly handles transitions and counts the necessary pieces.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of transitions between '1' and '0' and '0' and '1'. It then calculates the minimum number of pieces needed based on these transitions, which matches the problem's requirements. The provided test cases all produce the expected results, and no edge cases seem to be missed.
