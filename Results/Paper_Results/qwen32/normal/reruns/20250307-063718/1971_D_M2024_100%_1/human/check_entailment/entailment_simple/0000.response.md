### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the minimum number of pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The core idea of the program is to count the number of transitions between '1' and '0' (`cut1`) and between '0' and '1' (`cut0`). The logic is based on the fact that each transition between '1' and '0' (or vice versa) indicates a necessary cut to separate the segments that need to be rearranged.

- If there are no '01' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is either already sorted or consists of only '1's or only '0's. In this case, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`. The `+1` accounts for the initial segment before any '10' transitions.
- If there are '01' transitions (`cut0 > 0`), the total number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`. This accounts for both types of transitions, ensuring all segments can be rearranged into a sorted order.

Let's verify this logic with the provided example cases:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: '10' at index 1 and 3, '01' at index 2.
   - `cut1 = 2`, `cut0 = 1`
   - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (which matches the expected output).

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions.
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (which matches the expected output).

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions.
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (which matches the expected output).

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition: '10' at index 0.
   - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (which matches the expected output).

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - No transitions.
   - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (which matches the expected output).

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: '01' at index 0, '10' at index 2.
   - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 1`
   - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (which matches the expected output).

Based on the verification, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
