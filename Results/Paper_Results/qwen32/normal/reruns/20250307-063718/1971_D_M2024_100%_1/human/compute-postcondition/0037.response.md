Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2. The current character at index `i` in `a` is '0' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '1'. `cut1` is 0, and `cut0` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
