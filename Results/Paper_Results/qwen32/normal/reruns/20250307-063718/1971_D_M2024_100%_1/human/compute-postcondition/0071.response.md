The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to continue executing. According to the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The length of `a` does not change, so it remains the same.

The state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is `cut1` + 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is `cut0` + 1. Otherwise, `cut0` is not defined. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', `cut0` is increased by 1.**
