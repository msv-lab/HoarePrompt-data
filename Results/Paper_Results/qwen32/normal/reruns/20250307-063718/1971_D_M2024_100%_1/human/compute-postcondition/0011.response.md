Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 2, `cut0` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` remains 0, and `cut1` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` remains 0. Additionally, if `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1' for some index `i`, then `cut0` is set to 1.**
