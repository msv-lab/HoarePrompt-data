Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length at least 1 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is `cut0` + 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cut0` or `cut1`. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is `cut1` + 2, but this condition is not relevant to the else part as there is no else block.**

Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the case when the if condition is met or not met. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', `cut0` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cut0` or `cut1`.
