The code snippet provided increments the variable `cut0` by 1. The condition for incrementing `cut1` remains unchanged and depends on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. Therefore, `cut1` will either increment or remain the same based on the initial condition, but `cut0` will definitely increment by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == '1'` and `a[i + 1] == '0'`, then `cut1` is `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged; `cut0` is `cut0 + 1`.**
