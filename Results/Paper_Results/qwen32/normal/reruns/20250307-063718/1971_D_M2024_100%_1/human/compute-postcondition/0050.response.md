Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `cut0` is 0, meaning there are no occurrences of a '0' followed by a '1' in `a`. `cut1` is the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in `a`.**
