The code snippet `a = input()` reassigns the variable `a` to the value provided by the user input. The new value of `a` will be a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', as per the precondition. The values of `t`, `s`, `cut0`, and `cut1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' as provided by the user input, and `cut0` and `cut1` are as previously defined.**
