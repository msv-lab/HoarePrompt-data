Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `a` is the string provided as input, `cut0` is 0, and `cut1` is the total number of '10' transitions in the original string `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `cut0` has been explicitly set to 0. The values of `t`, `s`, `a`, and `cut1` remain unchanged.
