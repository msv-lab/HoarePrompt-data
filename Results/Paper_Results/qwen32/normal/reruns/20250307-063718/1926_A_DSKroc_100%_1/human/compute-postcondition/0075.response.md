Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 32) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function does not specify explicit return values for each case in the provided information, so the functionality focuses on accepting the input parameters as described.**
