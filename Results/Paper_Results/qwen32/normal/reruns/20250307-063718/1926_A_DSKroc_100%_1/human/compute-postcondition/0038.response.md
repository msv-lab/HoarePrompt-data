Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `i` is the second character in `s`, `q` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1 and `bc` depends on the value of the new `i`. Otherwise, `ac` depends on the value of `i` and `bc` is incremented by 1.**
