Postcondition: **`t` remains greater than 0, `q` is incremented by 1, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of characters in `s` that are not 'A'. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is indeed greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
