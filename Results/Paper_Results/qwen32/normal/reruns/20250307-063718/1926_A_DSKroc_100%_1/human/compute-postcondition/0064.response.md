The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the variable `ac` by 1. The other variables `t`, `q`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` remains greater than `q + 1`, `q` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `ac` is incremented by 1**.
