The code snippet `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The variable `ac` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its value also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is a user-provided string that must have at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is unchanged, `bc` is incremented by 1.**
