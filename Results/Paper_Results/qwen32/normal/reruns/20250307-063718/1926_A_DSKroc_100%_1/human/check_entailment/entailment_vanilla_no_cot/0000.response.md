Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such cases, the program defaults to printing 'B', which is not correct since the problem does not specify a preference for 'B' in the event of a tie. The program should handle ties appropriately, possibly by choosing one of the letters consistently or by specifying that ties are not expected (though the problem does not indicate this).

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles ties by choosing 'A' when counts are equal:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), but it should be consistent

func()
```

This version ensures that in the event of a tie, it will print 'A', but you can choose 'B' if that's the desired behavior.
