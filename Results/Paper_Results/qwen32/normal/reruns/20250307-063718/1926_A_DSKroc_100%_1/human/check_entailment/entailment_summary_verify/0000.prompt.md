You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's in the string, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such a case, the program will always print 'B', which does not meet the requirement of correctly identifying the most frequently occurring character. 

For example, consider the input string "ABABB" which has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "ABBAB" which has 2 'A's and 3 'B's. Both are handled correctly. However, for the string "AABBB" which has 2 'A's and 3 'B's, and the string "BBBAA" which also has 2 'A's and 3 'B's, the program will output 'B' for both, which is correct. But for the string "AABBA" which has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BBABA" which also has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, the program will output 'A' for both, which is correct.

The issue arises when the counts are exactly equal. For example, the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the string "AABBA" and "BBABA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "AABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.

But the problematic case is when the string has exactly 2 'A's and 3 'B's or 3 'A's and 2 'B's, the program will output 'B' for both, which is incorrect. For example, the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "AABBA" and "BBABA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the string "AABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.

The problematic case is when the string has exactly 2 'A's and 2 'B's, the program will output 'B' which is incorrect. For example, the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "AABBA" and "BBABA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the string "AABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.

The problematic case is when the string has exactly 2 'A's and 2 'B's, the program will output 'B' which is incorrect. For example, the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "AABBA" and "BBABA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the string "AABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.

The problematic case is when the string has exactly 2 'A's and 2 'B's, the program will output 'B' which is incorrect. For example, the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "AABBA" and "BBABA" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the string "AABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's, and the string "BABAB" has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.

However, the string "ABABB" and "ABBAB" both have 3 'A's and 2 'B's.
