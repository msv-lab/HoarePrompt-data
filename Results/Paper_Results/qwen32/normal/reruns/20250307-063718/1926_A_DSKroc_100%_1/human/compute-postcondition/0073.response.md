Postcondition: **`t` remains greater than `q + 1`, `q` is `q + 1`, `ac` is the count of 'A' characters in the string `s`, `bc` is the count of all other characters in the string `s`, `s` is the user input string. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is indeed greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
