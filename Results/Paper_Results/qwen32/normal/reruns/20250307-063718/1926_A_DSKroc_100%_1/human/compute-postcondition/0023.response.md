The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('B')
```

The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `ac`, `bc`, and `s`, but these variables are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement simply outputs the character 'B'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `ac`, `bc`, or `s`.

Output: **B**
