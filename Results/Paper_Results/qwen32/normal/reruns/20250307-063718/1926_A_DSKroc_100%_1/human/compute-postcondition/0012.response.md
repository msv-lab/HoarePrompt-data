The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `i`, and `bc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is a user-provided string that must have at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is incremented by 1, `bc` is determined by the value of `i` in the next iteration.**
