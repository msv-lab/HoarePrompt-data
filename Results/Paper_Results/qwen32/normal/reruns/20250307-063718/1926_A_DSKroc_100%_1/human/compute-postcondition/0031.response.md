The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, `s` is a string with at least one character, `q` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 'A'.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, `s` is a string with at least one character, `q` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 'A'**.
