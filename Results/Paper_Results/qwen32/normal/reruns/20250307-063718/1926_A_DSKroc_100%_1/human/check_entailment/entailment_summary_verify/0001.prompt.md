You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's in the string, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given test strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that will iterate `t` times, once for each test case.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: For each test case, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters are used to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, respectively.

3. **String Iteration**: The program reads the string `s` for the current test case and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac` by 1. If the character is 'B', it increments `bc` by 1.

4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, the program compares the two counters. If `ac` (the count of 'A') is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Since the problem guarantees that the input string is always of length 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B', the program does not need to handle any invalid input cases.

6. **Distinct Strings**: The problem states that all `t` strings are distinct, but this fact does not affect the logic of the program. The program processes each string independently.

7. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic used to count and compare the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' is correct. It accurately determines which character appears more frequently in each string.

However, there is a potential issue with the program's logic: If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (i.e., `ac == bc`), the program will incorrectly output 'B'. According to the problem statement, the program should output either 'A' or 'B' when the counts are equal, but it does not specify which one. In practice, the problem might expect a consistent choice (e.g., always choosing 'A' or always choosing 'B') when the counts are equal, but the given program does not handle this case explicitly.

Given the provided example, it seems that the program is expected to output 'A' when the counts are equal, as it does in the example case "ABABA". However, the program does not explicitly handle this case in its logic, which could lead to incorrect results in other scenarios where the counts are equal.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it does not explicitly handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal.

Correctness: **False**
