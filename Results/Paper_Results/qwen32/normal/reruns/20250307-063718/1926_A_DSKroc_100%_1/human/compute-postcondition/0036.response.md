The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`, `q`, `bc`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `i` is the second character in `s`, `q` is incremented by 1, `ac` is incremented by 1, `bc` depends on the value of the new `i`.**
