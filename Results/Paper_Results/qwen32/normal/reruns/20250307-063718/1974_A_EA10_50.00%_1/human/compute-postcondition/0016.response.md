The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is compared against `a` in the `range(a)`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first new input integer.
- `y` is the second new input integer.
- `a` is the value of `t`.
- `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.
- `i` is `a`.
- If `m < a`, then `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 14) // 15`.
- Otherwise, `z` remains `(y + 1) // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `a - 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first new input integer, `y` is the second new input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is `a - 1`**.
