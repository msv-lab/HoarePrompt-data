The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`. Since the loop iterates over `range(a)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next integer value it would take in the sequence.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, which we can infer to be `a - 1` because the loop would have just completed its last iteration with `i` equal to `a - 1`.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `a`.

However, since the loop in the provided state has already completed all its iterations (because `i` would have reached `a - 1` in the previous iteration), there is no next iteration to start. But if we hypothetically consider the state right before the loop finishes, `i` would be `a - 1` and it would be incremented to `a` to check the loop condition again, which would fail and terminate the loop.

For the sake of adhering to the task and considering the state right before the loop condition check fails, we adjust `i` to be `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is `a`**
