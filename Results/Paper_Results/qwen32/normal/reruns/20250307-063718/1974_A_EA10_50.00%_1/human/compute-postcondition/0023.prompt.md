Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. `a` is assigned the value of `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    z = (y + 1) // 2
    m = 15 * z - y * 4
    if m < a:
        z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
    print(z)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, and `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`. Otherwise, `z` remains `(y + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first new input integer, `y` is the second new input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is `a`. If `m < a`, then `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 14) // 15`. Otherwise, `z` remains `(y + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0; `x` and `y` are the new input integers; `a` is the value of `t`; `m` is `15 * z - y * 4`; `i` is `a - 1`; `z` is `(y + 1) // 2` initially, and if `m < a`, then `z` is updated to `z + (x - 15 * z + y * 4 + 14) // 15`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
