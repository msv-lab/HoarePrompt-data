Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.

```
a = int(input())
```

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. `a` is assigned the value of `t`.**
