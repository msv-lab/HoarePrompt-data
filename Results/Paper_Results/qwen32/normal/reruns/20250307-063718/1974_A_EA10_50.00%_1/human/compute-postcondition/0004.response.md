The value of `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. Given that `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, we substitute `z` in the equation for `m`:

\[ m = 15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4 \]

The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
