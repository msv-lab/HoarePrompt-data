The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two new integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means the previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten with the new input values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `x` and `y` are the new input integers; `a` is the value of `t`; `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`; `i` is `a - 1`**.
