The code snippet provided takes two integer inputs from the user and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `a` is assigned the value of `t`.

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the values provided by the user input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `a` is the value of `t`**.
