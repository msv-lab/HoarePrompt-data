The provided code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` by reading new input values. The previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first new input integer, `y` is the second new input integer, `a` is the value of `t`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is `a`**.
