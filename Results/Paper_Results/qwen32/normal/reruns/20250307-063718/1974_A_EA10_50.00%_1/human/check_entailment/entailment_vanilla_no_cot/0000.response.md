Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem. Let's analyze the issues:

1. The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This calculation does not make sense in the context of determining the number of screens needed. The value `m` seems to be intended to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the `2x2` icons, but the calculation is incorrect.

2. The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not a relevant value for checking the remaining space on the screens.

3. The expression `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is also incorrect and does not properly account for the placement of the `1x1` icons.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for the `2x2` icons first.
- Determine the remaining `1x1` icon space after placing the `2x2` icons.
- Calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 spaces
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 2) // 3  # Each screen can hold at most 3 (2x2) icons
        remaining_1x1_spaces = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - remaining_1x1_spaces
        if remaining_1x1_icons > 0:
            screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_1x1_icons + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold at most 15 (1x1) icons
        else:
            screens_for_1x1 = 0
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of screens needed for the `2x2` icons and then determines how many additional screens are needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.
