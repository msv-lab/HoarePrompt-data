Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify an issue.

The program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`, which is an attempt to determine how many screens are needed for the `2x2` icons. However, this calculation is flawed because it does not account for the fact that a screen can hold up to 4 `2x2` icons in an optimal arrangement.
2. It then calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`, which seems to be trying to determine the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons. However, the calculation is incorrect and does not account for the actual remaining space on the screens.
3. The program then adjusts `z` if `m < a`, but this adjustment is incorrect and does not properly account for the remaining `1x1` icons.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `x = 14, y = 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation for the example:
- For `y = 2`, the optimal arrangement would be to use 1 screen for the 2 `2x2` icons, leaving 7 cells free (since each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 15 cells in a screen).
- The remaining 14 `1x1` icons can be placed on the remaining 7 cells of the first screen and the 15 cells of a second screen, totaling 2 screens.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens as 3 for this case.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
