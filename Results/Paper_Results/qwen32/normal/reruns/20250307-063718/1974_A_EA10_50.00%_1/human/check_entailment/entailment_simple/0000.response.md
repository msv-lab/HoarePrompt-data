Let's analyze the given program and its logic to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it can hold a maximum of 15 (5*3) 1x1 icons.
2. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
3. The goal is to minimize the number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Analysis of the Program:

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It then calculates the minimum number of screens required and prints the result.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons:**
   ```python
   z = (y + 1) // 2
   ```
   This line calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 9 (3*3) 2x2 icons (but arranged optimally, it can hold 6, but the formula `(y + 1) // 2` is a simplified way of ensuring all 2x2 icons fit, considering the arrangement), this formula ensures that we are not underestimating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculate the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons:**
   ```python
   m = 15 * z - y * 4
   ```
   This line calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons, and since `z` screens are used for 2x2 icons, the total space used is `y * 4` cells (since each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells). The remaining space is `15 * z - y * 4`.

3. **Check if more screens are needed for the 1x1 icons:**
   ```python
   if m < x:
       z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
   ```
   This line checks if the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`. If so, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` calculates the number of additional screens required, considering that each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

4. **Print the result:**
   ```python
   print(z)
   ```
   Finally, the program prints the total number of screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program logic correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons based on the given constraints. It first allocates screens for 2x2 icons and then checks if additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
