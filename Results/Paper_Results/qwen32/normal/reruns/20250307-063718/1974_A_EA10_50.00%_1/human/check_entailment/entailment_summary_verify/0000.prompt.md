You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the counts of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 2x2 grid units required to cover all the icons.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify an issue.

The program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`, which is an attempt to determine how many screens are needed for the `2x2` icons. However, this calculation is flawed because it does not account for the fact that a screen can hold up to 4 `2x2` icons in an optimal arrangement.
2. It then calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`, which seems to be trying to determine the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons. However, the calculation is incorrect and does not account for the actual remaining space on the screens.
3. The program then adjusts `z` if `m < a`, but this adjustment is incorrect and does not properly account for the remaining `1x1` icons.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `x = 14, y = 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation for the example:
- For `y = 2`, the optimal arrangement would be to use 1 screen for the 2 `2x2` icons, leaving 7 cells free (since each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 15 cells in a screen).
- The remaining 14 `1x1` icons can be placed on the remaining 7 cells of the first screen and the 15 cells of a second screen, totaling 2 screens.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens as 3 for this case.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
