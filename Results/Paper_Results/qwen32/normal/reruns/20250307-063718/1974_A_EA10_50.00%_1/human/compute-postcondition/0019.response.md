Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `x` and `y` are the new input integers; `a` is the value of `t`; `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`; `i` is `a - 1`; `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is updated to `15 * z - y * 4`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been recalculated to `15 * z - y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
