Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have a grid of size 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
- We need to minimize the number of screens used.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line of the input is the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, we read two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Initial Screens (`z`):**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the `y` 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and each screen has 15 cells, we need to determine how many screens are required to place the 2x2 icons. The formula `(y + 1) // 2` is an attempt to do this, but it's not entirely correct because it doesn't account for the exact placement of the 2x2 icons on the screens.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells (`m`):**
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing the `y` 2x2 icons on `z` screens. However, this calculation is not accurate because `m` should be calculated based on the actual placement of the 2x2 icons, not just the total number of cells occupied by them.

4. **Adjusting Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The condition `if m < a` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. `a` is the number of test cases, not related to the number of remaining cells.
   - `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`: This attempts to add additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons based on the remaining cells, but the logic is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons based on the remaining cells.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 2) // 3  # Each screen can fit at most 3 2x2 icons
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_cells else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to flawed logic in calculating the number of screens required. The correct solution involves properly calculating the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

Correctness: **False**
