To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration:
1. It reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`.
3. It calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`.
4. If `m < t`, it updates `z` to `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
5. It prints the value of `z`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
The output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is the final printed values of `z` for each test case. The variable `a` remains constant as `t` throughout the loop, and `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`.

### Final Output State:
The final output state is a series of printed values of `z` for each test case. Each `z` is calculated based on the input values `x` and `y` for that test case, following the logic described above.

### Format:
Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The output state after all iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `z` calculated for each test case. The value of `z` is determined by the number of 1x1 (`x`) and 2x2 (`y`) application icons according to the specified logic.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the final output state:

**Initial State:**
- `t = 3`
- Test Case 1: `x = 5, y = 2`
- Test Case 2: `x = 10, y = 3`
- Test Case 3: `x = 15, y = 4`

**Execution:**
- For Test Case 1:
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7`
  - Since `m (7) < t (3)` is false, `z` remains `1`.
  - Print `1`.

- For Test Case 2:
  - `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 30 - 12 = 18`
  - Since `m (18) < t (3)` is false, `z` remains `2`.
  - Print `2`.

- For Test Case 3:
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 30 - 16 = 14`
  - Since `m (14) < t (3)` is false, `z` remains `2`.
  - Print `2`.

**Output State:**
Output State: **1 2 2**

In this example, the final output state after all iterations is `1 2 2`.

### General Output State:
The final output state after all iterations is the sequence of `z` values calculated for each test case, printed one per line or space-separated.
