Given the initial state, we know that `a` is a list with at least one element, and `i` is set to 1. The `print` statement is designed to print the element of the list `a` at the index `i` without a newline at the end (due to `end=''`).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `a` is a list with at least one element. Since the list has at least one element, it could be something like `[x, y, ...]` where `x` is the first element and `y` is the second element.
2. `i` is set to 1, meaning the print statement will access the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of the list `a`. 

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
