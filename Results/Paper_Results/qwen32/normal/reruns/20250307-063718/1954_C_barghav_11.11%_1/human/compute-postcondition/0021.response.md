Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string with `a[i]` updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `a[i]` is updated to be the smaller of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
