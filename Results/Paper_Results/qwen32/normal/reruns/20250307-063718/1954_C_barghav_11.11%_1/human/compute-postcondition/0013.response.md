Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If the current index `i` is less than or equal to the integer division of the length of `a` by 2 minus 1, then `b[i]` is set to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `a[i]` is set to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is set to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. In both cases, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
