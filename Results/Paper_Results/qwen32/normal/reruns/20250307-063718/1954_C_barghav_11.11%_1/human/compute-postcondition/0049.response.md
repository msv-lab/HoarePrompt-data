To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand the behavior and the given information:

1. **Initial State**: The concatenation of all elements in the list `a`.
2. **Loop Code**: 
    ```python
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    ```
3. **Output States after Iterations**:
    - After 1 iteration: `i` is 0, `b` must have at least one element.
    - After 2 iterations: `i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element.
    - After 3 iterations: `i` is 2, `b` must have at least 2 elements.

From the output states, it's clear that the loop prints elements of list `b` one by one until it reaches the end of `b`. The loop runs for `len(b)` iterations. Therefore, the final output will be the concatenation of all elements in list `b`.

Since the initial state only mentions the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` and the loop only involves list `b`, the final output state will be the concatenation of all elements in list `b`.

**Output State: **the concatenation of all elements in the list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is the concatenation of all the elements in the list `b`.
