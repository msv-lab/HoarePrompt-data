The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `b` must have at least one element. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The list `b` does not change; it merely needs to have at least one element for the loop to execute.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `b` must still have at least one element.

State: **the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element**
