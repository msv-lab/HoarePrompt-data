Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If the current index `i` is less than or equal to the integer division of the length of `a` by 2 minus 1, then `b[i]` is set to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `a[i]` is set to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is set to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. In both cases, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string with `a[i]` updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with `b[i]` updated to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is updated to `m`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. `a` is a list of characters from the input string with `a[i]` updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i` > `len(a) // 2 - 1`. `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with `b[i]` updated to the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is updated to `m` except for the current `i` where `b[i]` is updated to `m`. `i` is incremented by 1. `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
