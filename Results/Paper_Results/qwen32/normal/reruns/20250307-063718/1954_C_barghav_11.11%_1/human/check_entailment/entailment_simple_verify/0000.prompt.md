You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y`. The logic in the code does not ensure that the product is maximized for all cases. Specifically, the program swaps the digits of `x` and `y` based on whether the index is in the first or second half of the number, which is not a strategy that guarantees the maximum product.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
123
321
```

Expected Output (one of the possible correct outputs):
```
321
123
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
Swapping the digits `1` and `3` from both numbers results in `321` and `123`, which gives a product of `39483`. This is larger than the product of the original numbers `123 * 321 = 39483` or any other possible swaps.

However, the provided code will perform the following swaps:
- For `i = 0` (first half), it will swap `1` and `3`, resulting in `321` and `123`.
- For `i = 1` (middle), it will swap `2` and `2`, resulting in no change.
- For `i = 2` (second half), it will swap `1` and `3`, resulting in `321` and `123`.

The code ends up with `321` and `123` again, but the logic is flawed and does not generalize to all cases. For example, if the input is:
```
1
91
19
```

Expected Output (one of the possible correct outputs):
```
99
11
```

The provided code will not produce `99` and `11` because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum product for all possible inputs.
