The `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, the statement will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical or string value of the element at index 2. However, based on the information given, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list a)**
