Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the integer division of the length of `a` by 2 minus 1; `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
