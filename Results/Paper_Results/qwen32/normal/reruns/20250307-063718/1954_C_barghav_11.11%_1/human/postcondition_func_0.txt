The function `func_1` reads two strings `a` and `b` as input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9. It then rearranges the digits in each string such that for the first half of the strings, the larger digit is placed in `a` and the smaller in `b`, and for the second half, the smaller digit is placed in `a` and the larger in `b`. Finally, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` on separate lines.
