To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list whose elements are concatenated together.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `b` must have at least 2 elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- We are given that `i` is 2, so `b[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `b`.
- The `print` statement will output the element at index 2 of `b` without adding a newline at the end (due to `end=''`).

### Output:
Given that `b` must have at least 2 elements, we know that `b[2]` is a valid element of the list. However, the exact value of `b[2]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact value that will be printed, but we can describe it precisely based on the provided information.

Output: **b[2] (where b[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `b`)**
