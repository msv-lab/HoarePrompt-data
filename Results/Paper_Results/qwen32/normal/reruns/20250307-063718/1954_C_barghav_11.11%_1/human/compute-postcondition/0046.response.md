To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list, and the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` is mentioned, but it's not directly relevant to the print statement.
2. `i` is explicitly set to 1.
3. `b` is a list and must have at least one element.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```
- `b[i]` will access the element at index `i` in the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 1, `b[i]` will access the element at index 1 of the list `b`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline character is added after the printed value.

### Analysis:
- Given that `b` must have at least one element, the minimum length of `b` is 1. However, since we need to access `b[1]`, `b` must have at least two elements.
- The value of `b[1]` is the second element of the list `b`.

### Output:
Since the exact elements of `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `b[1]`. However, we know it will be the second element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the second element of the list `b`)**
