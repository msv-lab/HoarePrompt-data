### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y` as per the problem description. The logic implemented in `func_1` does not ensure that the product of the rearranged numbers is maximized. Instead, it performs a specific rearrangement based on the position of the digits (first half and second half), which does not necessarily lead to the maximum product.

To maximize the product of two numbers formed from the same digits, a more optimal strategy would be to sort the digits of both numbers in descending order and then distribute them in a way that balances the two numbers as closely as possible. This is because the product of two numbers is maximized when the numbers are as close to each other as possible.

Given the current implementation, it is clear that it does not follow this optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
