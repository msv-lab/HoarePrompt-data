Let's break down the given task step by step based on the provided initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The concatenation of all elements in the list `a` is mentioned. However, the list `a` itself is not explicitly provided.
   - `i` is set to 0.
   - `b` must have at least one element.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   - `print(b[i], end='')`

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is 0, so `b[i]` refers to the first element of the list `b`.
   - Since `b` must have at least one element, `b[0]` is guaranteed to exist.
   - The `end=''` argument in the `print` function ensures that no newline character is added after the printed value.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the first element of the list `b` without adding a newline at the end.

Given that the exact elements of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `b`.

Output: **b[0] (where b[0] is the first element of the list b)**
