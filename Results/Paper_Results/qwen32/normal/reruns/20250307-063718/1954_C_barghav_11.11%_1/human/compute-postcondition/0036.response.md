Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least one element.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Analysis:
- The code attempts to print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. This means `i` could be any valid index for the list `a`. Since `a` has at least one element, `i` could be 0, 1, 2, and so on, up to `len(a) - 1`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the printed element.

Given the lack of a specific value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact element that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] (where i is a valid index for the list a)**
