### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to maximize the product of two integers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits. However, the logic in the function `func_1` does not correctly achieve this goal. Instead of strategically swapping digits to maximize the product, the function simply swaps the first half of the digits to have the maximum digit in `x` and the minimum in `y`, and the second half to have the minimum in `x` and the maximum in `y`. This approach does not guarantee the maximum product.

For example, consider the test case:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The program would swap the first half digits to get `x = 39` and `y = 35`, and the second half digits to get `x = 3912` and `y = 3586`. However, a better strategy would be to swap the digits to get `x = 3986` and `y = 3512`, which would yield a higher product.

The given function does not implement a strategy to maximize the product of `x` and `y`, and thus the program is incorrect.
