Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program constructs a list `b` by selecting elements based on the commands ('L' or 'R'). However, it does not compute the product of all elements of the current state of `a` at each step. Instead, it multiplies elements from `b` in reverse order, which is not the intended behavior.
   - The problem requires computing the product of all elements in the current state of `a` (not `b`) and then taking the remainder when divided by `m`.

2. **Misuse of `m`**:
   - The variable `m` is provided as a parameter but is not used in the function `func_1`. The remainder operation should be applied to the product of the elements of the current state of `a` at each step.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The function is supposed to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of `a` at each step before removing an element based on the command. The current implementation does not achieve this.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Compute the product of all elements in the current state of `a` at each step.
- Take the remainder of this product when divided by `m`.
- Output this remainder.
- Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of all elements in the current state of a
        for x in a:
            product = (product * x) % m
        # Append the remainder to the answer list
        ans.append(product)
        # Remove the appropriate element based on the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        # Reset product for the next iteration
        product = 1
    return ans
```

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
