Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the integer `a[r]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `s[i]` is 'R'**

In simple terms, the list `b` now contains the element `a[r]` (the last element of the list `a`), all other variables remain unchanged.
