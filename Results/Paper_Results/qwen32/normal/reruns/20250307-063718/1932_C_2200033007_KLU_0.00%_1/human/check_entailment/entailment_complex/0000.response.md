### Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Misuse of `m`:** The variable `m` is given in the problem statement as the modulus to be used for calculating the remainder of the product of the array elements. However, the provided code does not use `m` anywhere in the `func_1` function. Instead, it calculates the product of the elements and returns the reversed list of cumulative products without taking the modulus.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation:** The program constructs the list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order. However, the cumulative product should be taken modulo `m` at each step to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's requirements. The current implementation does not do this, which can lead to incorrect results, especially given the constraints (elements up to 10,000 and up to 200,000 elements in total across all test cases).

3. **Reversing the List:** The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which is correct in terms of the sequence of products, but the products themselves are not correct because they are not taken modulo `m`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not use the modulus `m` during the calculation of the product of the elements, which is a critical part of the problem requirements. The correct implementation should calculate the product modulo `m` at each step to ensure the results are correct and within the required constraints.
