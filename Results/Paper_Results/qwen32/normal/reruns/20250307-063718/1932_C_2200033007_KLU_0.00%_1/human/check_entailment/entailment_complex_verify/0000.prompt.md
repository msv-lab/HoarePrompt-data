You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: `b` contains `n` elements chosen from `a` according to `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is `[b[n-1], b[n-1] * b[n-2], ..., b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[1], b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]]`; `p` is `b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` where `ans` is `[b[n-1], b[n-1] * b[n-2], ..., b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[1], b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]]`. The reversed list will be `[b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0], b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[1], ..., b[n-1] * b[n-2], b[n-1]]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of integers of length `n`), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' selects from the left, 'R' from the right). Then, it computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first. The function returns this list `ans` in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not calculate the product of the array elements and take the remainder at each step before removing elements as specified.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program collects elements in the list `b` based on the commands, but it does not calculate the product of the current array elements and take the remainder at each step.
   - Instead, it calculates the product of the collected elements in reverse order and then takes the remainder, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The problem requires that the product of all elements of the current array is calculated and the remainder is taken before any element is removed.
   - The program calculates the product after elements have been removed, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial array: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
- First command 'L': Product is `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 = 24`, remainder is `24 % 6 = 0`. Remove leftmost element, new array is `[1, 4, 2]`.
- Second command 'R': Product is `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`, remainder is `8 % 6 = 2`. Remove rightmost element, new array is `[1, 4]`.
- Third command 'R': Product is `1 * 4 = 4`, remainder is `4 % 6 = 4`. Remove rightmost element, new array is `[1]`.
- Fourth command 'L': Product is `1`, remainder is `1 % 6 = 1`. Remove leftmost element, new array is `[]`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce `0 2 4 1` because it does not correctly calculate the product and take the remainder at each step.

### Correct Approach:

The program should:
1. Initialize the product of the array elements.
2. For each command, calculate the product of the current array elements, take the remainder, and then remove the appropriate element based on the command.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    product = 1
    for val in a:
        product = (product * val) % m
    result = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            r -= 1
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version calculates the product and remainder at each step and correctly updates the product when elements are removed.
