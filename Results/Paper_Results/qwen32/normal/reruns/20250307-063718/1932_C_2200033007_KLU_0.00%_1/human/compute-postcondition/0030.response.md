The code snippet `p = p * v` multiplies the current value of `p` by `v` and assigns the result back to `p`. Given that the initial state specifies `p` is `v`, the new value of `p` will be `v * v` or `v^2`.

Output State: **`b` contains `n` elements chosen from `a` according to `s` and must have at least 2 elements; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is `[v]`; `p` is `v * v`**.
