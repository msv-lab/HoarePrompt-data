Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `i + 2`, `b` has an additional element `a[l]` appended to it, `l` is `l + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, which means `l` now points to the next element in the list `a`. The variable `i` was incremented by 1 before the code snippet, and it is incremented by 1 again in the snippet, making it `i + 2`. The list `b` has an additional element `a[l]` appended to it, which is the element in `a` at the index `l` before it was incremented. All other variables remain unchanged.
