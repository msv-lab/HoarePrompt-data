Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of lists `a` and `s`), `m` (an integer), `a` (a list of integers of length `n`), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). The function returns a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from the end of list `b` (which is derived from `a` and `s`) to the current position, in reverse order.**
