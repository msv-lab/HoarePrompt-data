Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5. `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
