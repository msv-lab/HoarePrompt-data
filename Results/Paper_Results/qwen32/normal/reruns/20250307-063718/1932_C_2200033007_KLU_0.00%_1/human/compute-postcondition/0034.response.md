The code snippet `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given that `ans` initially contains `[v, v * v]`, after appending `p`, `ans` will contain `[v, v * v, p]`.

The values of `b`, `l`, `r`, and `p` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`b` contains `n` elements chosen from `a` according to `s` and must have at least 2 elements; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is `[v, v * v, p]`; `p` is `v`.**
