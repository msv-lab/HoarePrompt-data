The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, but `l` is not mentioned to be incremented or changed, so we assume `l` remains the same unless otherwise stated. The only change is that list `b` now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `i + 1`, and `b` includes an additional element `a[l]`.**
