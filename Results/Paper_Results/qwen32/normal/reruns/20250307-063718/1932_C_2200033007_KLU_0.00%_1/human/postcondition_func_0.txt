The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of integers of length `n`), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' selects from the left, 'R' from the right). Then, it computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first. The function returns this list `ans` in reverse order.
