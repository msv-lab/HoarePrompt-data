The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`, as it gains a new element. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `i + 1`, `b` has a new element `a[r]` appended to it.**
