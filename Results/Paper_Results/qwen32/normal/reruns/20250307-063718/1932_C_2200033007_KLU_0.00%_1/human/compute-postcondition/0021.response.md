The code snippet provided decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `i`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` has a new element `a[r]` appended to it

After executing `r -= 1`, the value of `r` is decreased by 1. No other variables are changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is `i + 1`; `b` has a new element `a[r]` appended to it; `r` is decreased by 1.**
