Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the described problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Selection of Elements:**
   - The program uses a list `b` to store elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, it doesn't use these elements to calculate the product at each step. Instead, it calculates the product of the elements stored in `b` in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Product:**
   - The problem requires calculating the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element based on the command. The program calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which does not match the problem's requirement.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The problem requires taking the remainder of the product modulo `m` at each step. The program does not apply the modulo operation to the product at each step.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Calculate the product of all elements in `a` at each step.
- Apply the modulo operation to the product.
- Remove the appropriate element based on the command.
- Output the result of the modulo operation at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for value in a:
        product = (product * value) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- We first calculate the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- We then iterate through the commands, appending the current product (modulo `m`) to the result list `ans`.
- We remove the appropriate element based on the command and update the product accordingly using modular multiplicative inverse.

Correctness: **False**
