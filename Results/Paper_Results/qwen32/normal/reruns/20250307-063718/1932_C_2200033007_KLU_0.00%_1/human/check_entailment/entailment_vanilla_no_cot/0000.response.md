Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
   - The program calculates the product of the elements in the array `a` in the order they are removed, but it does not correctly compute the product remainder at each step.
   - The program incorrectly uses the elements stored in `b` to compute the product, which are just the elements in the order they are removed, not the product of the remaining elements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and then takes the remainder, but it does not account for the fact that the product should be computed from the current state of the array `a` after each command is processed.

3. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output for each test case. The output should be the remainders of the product of the current array after each command, but the program does not compute these values correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    # Process each command
    result = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            r -= 1
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The initial product of the array `a` modulo `m` is calculated.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command, the current product modulo `m` is added to the result list.
   - Depending on the command ('L' or 'R'), the leftmost or rightmost element is removed from the product using modular inverse (`pow(a[i], m - 2, m)`).

3. **Output:**
   - The remainders of the product after each command are printed in the correct order.
