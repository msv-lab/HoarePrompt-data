The code appends the value of `a[l]` to the list `b`. Given that `l` is 0, `a[l]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `b` will now contain the first element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and the current character `s[i]` is 'L'.**
