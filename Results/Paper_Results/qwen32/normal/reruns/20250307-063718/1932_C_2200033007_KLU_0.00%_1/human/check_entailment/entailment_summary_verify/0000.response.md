### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to process a series of commands ('L' and 'R') on an array `a` of length `n`.
- For each command, we must:
  1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
  2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands ('L' or 'R').
   - It then calculates the cumulative product of elements from `b` in reverse order and takes the remainder.
   - This is incorrect because the problem requires calculating the product of all current elements of `a` and taking the remainder before any element is removed.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the product after elements have already been removed, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach is to calculate the product of all current elements of `a` and take the remainder before removing any element.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples because of the incorrect product calculation and order of operations.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` collects elements from `a` into `b` based on the commands.
- It then computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from `b` in reverse order.
- The function returns this list `ans` in reverse order.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program.
- The assessment points out that the program does not calculate the product of the current array elements and take the remainder at each step before removing elements.

#### Correct Approach:
- Initialize the product of the array elements.
- For each command, calculate the product of the current array elements, take the remainder, and then remove the appropriate element based on the command.
- This requires an efficient way to update the product when an element is removed. One common technique is to use modular inverses for division in modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not follow the required logic of calculating the product of the current array elements and taking the remainder before removing elements. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
