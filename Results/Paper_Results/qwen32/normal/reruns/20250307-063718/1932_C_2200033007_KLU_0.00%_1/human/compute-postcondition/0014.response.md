The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since `r` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume `r` is a valid index for list `a`. The list `b` is updated by adding the element `a[r]` to it. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is a list that now includes `a[r]` as its last element.**
