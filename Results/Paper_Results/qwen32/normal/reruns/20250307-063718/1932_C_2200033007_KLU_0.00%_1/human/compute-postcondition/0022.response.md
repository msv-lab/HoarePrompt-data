Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `i` is `i + 2`, `b` has an additional element `a[l]` appended to it, and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` has a new element `a[r]` appended to it, and `r` is decreased by 1.**
