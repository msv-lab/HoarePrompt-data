Output State: **The program returns a reversed list `ans` where `ans` is `[b[n-1], b[n-1] * b[n-2], ..., b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[1], b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]]`. The reversed list will be `[b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0], b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[1], ..., b[n-1] * b[n-2], b[n-1]]`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list starting with the product of all elements in `b` and ending with the last element of `b`, with each subsequent element being the product of all elements in `b` up to that point, in reverse order.
