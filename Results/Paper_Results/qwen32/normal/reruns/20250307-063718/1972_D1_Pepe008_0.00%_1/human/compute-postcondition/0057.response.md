Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`.**

In natural language: The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
