Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 12) // 4` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. `suma` is updated to `suma + x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
