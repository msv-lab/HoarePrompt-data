The code `info = input().split()` takes a new input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `info`. This means the previous value of `info` is overwritten by the new input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.**

In natural language: The variable `info` is now a list of substrings from the new input provided by the user. All other variables retain their previous values.
