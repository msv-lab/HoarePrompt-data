Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0. The values of `i` and `j` are not retained after the loop, and the code may print pairs of `(i, j)` that satisfy the condition `int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0`.**

Explanation: The value of `suma` is reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
