The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `b + 1`. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `b` (inclusive), the variable `i` is the only one that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already equal to `b`, the loop will not execute again in the next iteration. However, based on the task requirement to adjust the state for the next iteration, we should consider the state just before the loop would terminate.

So, at the start of the next (hypothetical) iteration, `i` would be `b + 1`, which is the point where the loop condition fails and the loop terminates.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to `suma + x`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
