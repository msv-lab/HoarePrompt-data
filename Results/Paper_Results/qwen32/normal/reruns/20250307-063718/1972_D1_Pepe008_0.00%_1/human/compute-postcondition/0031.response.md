The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `b + 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `b + 1`, which means the loop has just finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to 1 and `b` must be such that `b + 1` is greater than 1.

However, since the loop has just finished with `i` being `b + 1`, the next iteration would start with `i` being 1 if the loop were to restart, but given that the loop has ended, we need to consider the state right before the loop ends, which means `i` should be `b` for the next (hypothetical) start.

Given the loop condition, for the loop to start again, `i` should be reset to 1, and `b` should be adjusted such that `b + 1` is greater than 1 (which is always true as long as `b` is at least 0).

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is `x` and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**
