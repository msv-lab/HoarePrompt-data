Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `suma` is reset to 0 by the code `suma = 0`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by this line of code.
