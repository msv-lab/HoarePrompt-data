To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive). During each iteration, it calculates `x` and updates `suma` if the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is met.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `suma` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` and `b` are the integer values of the first and second substrings in `info`, respectively.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `b`:
     - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by `x`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the iterations.

Let's derive the final output state:

- `T` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `info` remains a list of substrings from the input.
- `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state.
- `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes.
- `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

The final `suma` is the result of the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.

**Output State: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.**

In natural language: The final state after the loop completes includes the same values for `T`, `info`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as the initial state, except `i` will be `b + 1` (the loop has finished iterating), and `suma` will be the accumulated sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was true.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.**
