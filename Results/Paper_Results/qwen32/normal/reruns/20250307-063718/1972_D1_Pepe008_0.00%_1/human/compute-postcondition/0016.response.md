Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 5, `x` is `(a - 5 * (5 - 1)) // 5 ** 2 + 1`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x` if `a - 20 > 0`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is recalculated to be `(a - 5 * (5 - 1)) // 5 ** 2 + 1`. The values of `T`, `info`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `a - 20 > 0`, `suma` is updated to include the new value of `x`.
