To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Iterating Over \(b\):**
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.

3. **Calculating Valid \(a\) Values:**
   - The key formula used is:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current \(b\) value.
   - The program then adds \(x\) to the sum if the expression \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the formula correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

Given the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), let's rewrite it:
\[
a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
\]
for some integer \(k\).

If we let \(a = i \cdot d\) and \(b = j \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then:
\[
i \cdot d + j \cdot d = k \cdot j \cdot d \cdot d
\]
\[
i + j = k \cdot j \cdot d
\]
\[
i = (k \cdot j \cdot d) - j
\]
\[
i = j \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
\]

This means \(a\) must be of the form \(a = j \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

The program's formula seems to be derived from this condition, but let's check if it correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- After all iterations, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` contains the last input values, `a` and `b` are the last input integers, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum calculated for the last iteration.

### Evaluation:
The annotations confirm that the program iterates over all possible values of `b` and calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. The formula used in the program seems to be derived from the condition given in the problem. However, let's check the logic more closely.

The formula \(x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`. The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that the expression inside the formula is valid.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying the logic, it appears that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The formula used in the program seems to be a derived form of the condition given in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
