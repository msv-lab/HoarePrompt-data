Output State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain as described in the initial state.**

In simpler terms, `T` is now the integer value input by the user, while `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial described properties.
