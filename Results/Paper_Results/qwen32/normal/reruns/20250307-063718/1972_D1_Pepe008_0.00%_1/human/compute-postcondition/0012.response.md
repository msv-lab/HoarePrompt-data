Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
