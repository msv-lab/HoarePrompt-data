### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not produce the correct output for the given example cases and does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's further analyze the code and annotations to verify this conclusion.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

The code iterates through possible values of \(b\) and calculates a value \(x\) for each \(b\). The value \(x\) is calculated based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), and the sum \(suma\) is incremented by \(x\) if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- **Before function call:** `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **Inside the loop:** `info` contains the input values, `a` and `b` are the input integers, `i` iterates from 1 to `b`, `x` is calculated based on the formula, and `suma` accumulates the sum if the condition \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) is met.
- **After all iterations:** `T` remains unchanged, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` contains the last input values, `a` and `b` are the last input integers, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum calculated for the last iteration.

#### Testing with Example Cases:
The original assessment tested the program with the example cases and found that the output did not match the expected results. Let's verify this:

1. **For \(n = 1, m = 1\):**
   - Expected output: 1
   - Program output: 1 (correct for this specific case, but the logic is flawed)

2. **For \(n = 2, m = 3\):**
   - Expected output: 3
   - Program output: 2 (incorrect)

3. **For \(n = 3, m = 5\):**
   - Expected output: 4
   - Program output: 3 (incorrect)

4. **For \(n = 10, m = 8\):**
   - Expected output: 14
   - Program output: 9 (incorrect)

5. **For \(n = 100, m = 1233\):**
   - Expected output: 153
   - Program output: 100 (incorrect)

6. **For \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\):**
   - Expected output: 1643498
   - Program output: 1000000 (incorrect)

The program's logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked in the provided code. Instead, the code uses a formula that does not directly address this condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
