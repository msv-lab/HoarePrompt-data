The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the variable `suma`. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. 

Given that `a`, `i`, and `x` have specific values or expressions, `suma` will be updated to its current value plus `x`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**
