Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem efficiently by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Iterating Over \(b\):**
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.

3. **Calculating Valid \(a\) Values:**
   - The key formula used is:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current \(b\) value.
   - The program then adds \(x\) to the sum if the expression \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

### Verification:
To verify if the program is correct, we need to check if the formula used correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

Given the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), let's rewrite it:
\[
a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
\]
for some integer \(k\).

If we let \(a = i \cdot d\) and \(b = j \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then:
\[
i \cdot d + j \cdot d = k \cdot j \cdot d \cdot d
\]
\[
i + j = k \cdot j \cdot d
\]
\[
i = (k \cdot j \cdot d) - j
\]
\[
i = j \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
\]

This means \(a\) must be of the form \(a = i \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

The program's formula seems to be derived from this condition, but let's check if it correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values.

### Detailed Check of the Formula:
The formula provided in the program is:
\[
x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
\]

Let's break down the logic:
- For each \(b = i\), we need to find how many \(a\) values satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The formula seems to be counting the number of multiples of \(b\) within the range \([1, n]\) that satisfy the condition.

However, the formula \(x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) does not directly align with the derived condition \(a = i \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\). The formula appears to be an attempt to count the number of valid \(a\) values but may not be correctly capturing all valid pairs.

### Testing the Program:
Let's manually test the program with the provided example cases to see if it produces the correct results.

#### Example Test Case:
For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output is 14.

Running the program with this input:
- The program iterates over \(b\) from 1 to 8.
- For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula.
- The final result is printed after subtracting 1 from the sum.

Let's manually verify the logic:
- For \(b = 1\), valid \(a\) values are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\) (10 values).
- For \(b = 2\), valid \(a\) values are \(2, 6, 10\) (3 values).
- For \(b = 3\), valid \(a\) values are \(3, 6, 9\) (3 values).
- For \(b = 4\), valid \(a\) values are \(4, 8\) (2 values).
- For \(b = 5\), valid \(a\) values are \(5, 10\) (2 values).
- For \(b = 6\), valid \(a\) values are \(6\) (1 value).
- For \(b = 7\), valid \(a\) values are \(7\) (1 value).
- For \(b = 8\), valid \(a\) values are \(8\) (1 value).

Summing these values, we get \(10 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23\). Subtracting 1, we get 22, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The formula used in the program does not align with the derived condition \(a = i \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
