The initial state provided is simply `T`, which does not give us any information about the variable `suma` that is used in the `print` statement. Since `suma` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `suma`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(suma - 1)
```

This statement will output the value of `suma` minus 1. Since `suma` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a numerical value. The output will be the result of subtracting 1 from whatever value `suma` holds.

Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the value of the variable suma)**
