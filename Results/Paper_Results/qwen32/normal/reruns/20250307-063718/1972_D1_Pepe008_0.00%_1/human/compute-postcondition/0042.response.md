The code snippet `info = input().split()` takes a new input, splits it into a list of substrings, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. This means the previous value of `info` is overwritten with the new list of substrings from the input.

The other variables (`T`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Given this, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated for each `i` from 1 to `b` where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
