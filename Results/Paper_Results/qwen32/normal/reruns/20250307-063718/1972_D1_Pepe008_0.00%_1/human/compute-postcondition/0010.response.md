Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Otherwise, `suma` and `x` retain their initial values.**
