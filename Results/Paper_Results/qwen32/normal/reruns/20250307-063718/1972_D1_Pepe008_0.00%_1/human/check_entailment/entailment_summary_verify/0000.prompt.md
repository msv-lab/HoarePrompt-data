You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then computes a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap

The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \(b\) and calculating a value \(x\) for each \(b\). The value \(x\) is calculated based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), and the sum \(suma\) is incremented by \(x\) if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

However, the logic used in the program does not seem to directly relate to the problem's requirements. Let's consider the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This condition is not directly addressed in the provided code.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the provided code with the example cases given in the problem description:

1. For \(n = 1, m = 1\):
   - Expected output: 1
   - Program output: 1 (assuming the formula is somehow correct for this case)

2. For \(n = 2, m = 3\):
   - Expected output: 3
   - Program output: 2 (incorrect)

3. For \(n = 3, m = 5\):
   - Expected output: 4
   - Program output: 3 (incorrect)

4. For \(n = 10, m = 8\):
   - Expected output: 14
   - Program output: 9 (incorrect)

5. For \(n = 100, m = 1233\):
   - Expected output: 153
   - Program output: 100 (incorrect)

6. For \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\):
   - Expected output: 1643498
   - Program output: 1000000 (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not produce the correct output for the given example cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
