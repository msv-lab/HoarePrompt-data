The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `b`, and the range from which `i` is drawn (`1` to `b + 1`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a certain value, and `b` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, as it is the loop variable.
- `b` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (since `i` is incremented within the loop), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4, and `b` should remain as it is.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4**
