Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is not yet assigned a value from the loop, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 5, `x` is `(a - 20) // 5` if `a - 20 > 0`, otherwise `x` remains as `(a - 20) // 5` without modification, and `suma` is incremented by `x` if `a - 20 > 0`.**
