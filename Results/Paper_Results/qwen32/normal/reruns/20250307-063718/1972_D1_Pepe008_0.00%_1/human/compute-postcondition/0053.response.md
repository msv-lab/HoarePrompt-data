Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated as `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
