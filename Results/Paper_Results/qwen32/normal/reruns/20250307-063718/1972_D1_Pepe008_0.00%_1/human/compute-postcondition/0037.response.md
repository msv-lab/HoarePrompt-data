The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `suma`. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `suma`, which will now hold its previous value plus the value of `x`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**
