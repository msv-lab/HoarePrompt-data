Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided `n` and `m`. Specifically, if `n` and `m` are within the constraints (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), it computes and returns a result for each test case. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
