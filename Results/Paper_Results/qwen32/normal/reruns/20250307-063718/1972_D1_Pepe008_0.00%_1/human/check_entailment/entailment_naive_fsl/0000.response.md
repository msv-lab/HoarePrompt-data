Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap

The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \(b\) and calculating a value \(x\) for each \(b\). The value \(x\) is calculated based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), and the sum \(suma\) is incremented by \(x\) if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

However, the logic used in the program does not seem to directly relate to the problem's requirements. Let's consider the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This condition is not directly addressed in the provided code.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the provided code with the example cases given in the problem description:

1. For \(n = 1, m = 1\):
   - Expected output: 1
   - Program output: 1 (assuming the formula is somehow correct for this case)

2. For \(n = 2, m = 3\):
   - Expected output: 3
   - Program output: 2 (incorrect)

3. For \(n = 3, m = 5\):
   - Expected output: 4
   - Program output: 3 (incorrect)

4. For \(n = 10, m = 8\):
   - Expected output: 14
   - Program output: 9 (incorrect)

5. For \(n = 100, m = 1233\):
   - Expected output: 153
   - Program output: 100 (incorrect)

6. For \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\):
   - Expected output: 1643498
   - Program output: 1000000 (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not produce the correct output for the given example cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
