Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic inside the loop for calculating `suma` is incorrect and does not properly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

The commented-out section of the code suggests a brute-force approach, which is not efficient given the constraints, but it at least aligns with the problem statement. The uncommented section of the code attempts to optimize the solution but fails to do so correctly.

To solve the problem efficiently, one would need to use mathematical insights or optimizations, such as iterating over possible values of `gcd(a, b)` and counting valid pairs accordingly. The current implementation does not follow such a correct approach.
