The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, and `i` is `b + 1`, we can express `x` in terms of these variables. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**.
