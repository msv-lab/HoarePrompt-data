You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

    #State: After all iterations, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` contains the last input values, `a` and `b` are the last input integers, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum calculated for the last iteration. The program will have printed the results for each of the `T` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem efficiently by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Iterating Over \(b\):**
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.

3. **Calculating Valid \(a\) Values:**
   - The key formula used is:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current \(b\) value.
   - The program then adds \(x\) to the sum if the expression \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

### Verification:
To verify if the program is correct, we need to check if the formula used correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

Given the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), let's rewrite it:
\[
a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
\]
for some integer \(k\).

If we let \(a = i \cdot d\) and \(b = j \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then:
\[
i \cdot d + j \cdot d = k \cdot j \cdot d \cdot d
\]
\[
i + j = k \cdot j \cdot d
\]
\[
i = (k \cdot j \cdot d) - j
\]
\[
i = j \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
\]

This means \(a\) must be of the form \(a = j \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

The program's formula seems to be derived from this condition, but let's check if it correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) values.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying the logic, it appears that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The formula used in the program seems to be a derived form of the condition given in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.
