To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` given the initial state of the variables. Here is the provided code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `T` is an integer greater than 0
- `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input
- `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state (values not specified but remain unchanged)
- `t` is 2
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `i` is `b`

The code snippet:
```
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Now, let's evaluate the expression for `x`:

Given that `i` is `b` and `b` must be at least 1, we substitute `i` with `b` in the expression:

```
x = (a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1
```

This expression calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `a` and `b`. The other variables (`T`, `info`, `n`, `m`, `t`) are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `T` remains an integer greater than 0, `info` remains a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `t` is still 2, `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` remains equal to `b`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.
