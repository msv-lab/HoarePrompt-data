Reasoning:  
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided code does not directly implement the above logic. Instead, it computes a sum based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(b\), and then subtracts 1 from this sum. This approach seems to be an optimization or a different way to solve the problem, but it's not immediately clear if it's correct without a proper derivation.

The execution summary mentions that the function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\), computes a sum, and prints the result minus one. However, this summary does not provide enough information to confirm the correctness of the program.

To verify the correctness, we would need to either:
1. Derive the formula used in the program and confirm that it correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
2. Test the program against multiple test cases and compare the output with the expected results.

Since the problem statement and the execution summary do not provide enough information to confirm the correctness of the program, and given that the provided code does not directly implement the logic described in the problem statement, we cannot definitively say that the program is correct.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
