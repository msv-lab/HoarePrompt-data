Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `x`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `suma` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
