Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `suma` remains 0.**

In simple terms: The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
