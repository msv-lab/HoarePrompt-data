Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the variable `x` is recalculated with a new formula. Here's the updated value of `x` based on the new formula provided:

Initial State: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Now, `x` is updated to the new value calculated by the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings from the new input, `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
