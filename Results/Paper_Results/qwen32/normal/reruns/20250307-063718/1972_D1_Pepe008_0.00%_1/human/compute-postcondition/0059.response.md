To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and the conditions under which the loop executes. The loop iterates from `1` to `b` inclusive, and in each iteration, it calculates `x` and updates `suma` if a certain condition is met.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `T` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `info` is a new list of substrings from the new input.
   - `n` and `m` remain as described in the initial state.
   - `t` is 2.
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
   - `i` is initialized to `b + 1`.
   - `suma` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
   - In each iteration, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by `x`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1` (as the loop runs from 1 to b inclusive).
   - `suma` will contain the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

To calculate the final value of `suma`, we need to sum up `x` for each `i` from 1 to `b` where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `b`. The final state of `i` will be `b + 1`, and `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.

**Output State: **T** is an integer greater than 0, **info** is a new list of substrings from the new input, **n** and **m** remain as described in the initial state, **t** is 2, **a** is the integer value of **info[0]**, **b** is the integer value of **info[1]**, **i** is **b + 1**, **suma** is the accumulated sum of **x** for all **i** from 1 to **b** where **a - i * (i - 1) > 0**.**

In simple terms, the loop will finish executing with `i` being one more than `b`, and `suma` will be the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop iterations.
