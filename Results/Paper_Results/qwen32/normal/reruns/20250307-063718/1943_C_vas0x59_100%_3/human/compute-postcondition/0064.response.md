Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing four elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)]`, `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.**

In natural language: The variable `ops` now contains four elements, with the last element being `(c2, i)`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
