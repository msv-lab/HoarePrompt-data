The code snippet `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, if `n` is `-1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of, but this does not affect the value of `path_ba` directly before the break. If `n` is not `-1`, the value of `n` is added to `path_ba`.

Therefore, the updated state of `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`. If `n` is `-1`, the loop or if statement is broken, but `path_ba` remains `[b, n]`.

Since the problem specifies that we should include all the information of the precondition that is still valid and only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`; if `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`.**
