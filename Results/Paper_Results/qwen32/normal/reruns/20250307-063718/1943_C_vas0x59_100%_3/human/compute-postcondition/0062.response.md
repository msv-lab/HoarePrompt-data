The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `path_ba`, and the range parameters. Since `path_ba` and its length are not changing, we only need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time, stopping before `len(path_ba) - ci1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 2.

Given:
- `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, where `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- The loop runs for `i` in the range `[1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value that satisfied the loop condition. To find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 2.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev + 2`.

Since the exact value of `i_prev` is not provided, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 2 from its previous value.

State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing two elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]`, `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value**.
