Postcondition: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b]`, and if `n` is -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described without any further changes.**
