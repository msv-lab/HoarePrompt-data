The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Here's the updated state based on the given initial state:

- `d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even.
- `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
- `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`.
- `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
- `ops` is a list containing two elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]`.
- `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.

After executing the code `ops.append((c1, i))`, the list `ops` will now contain three elements: `[(c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i)]`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing three elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i)]`, `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.**
