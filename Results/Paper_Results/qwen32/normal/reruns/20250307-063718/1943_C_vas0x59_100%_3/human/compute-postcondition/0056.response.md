The code snippet calculates `ci1` by subtracting 1 from `ci2`. Given that `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` will be one less than half the length of `path_ba`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.**

In simple terms, the output state maintains all the previous variable states except for the addition of `ci1`, which is calculated as one less than `ci2`.
