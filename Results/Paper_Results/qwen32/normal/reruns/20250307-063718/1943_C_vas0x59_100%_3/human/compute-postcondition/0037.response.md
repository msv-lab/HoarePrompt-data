For the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Since the loop head does not contain any conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue, no modifications to the program state are necessary for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

Here is the state as it is at the end of the previous iteration, which can be repeated for the next iteration:

State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`; if `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`**.
