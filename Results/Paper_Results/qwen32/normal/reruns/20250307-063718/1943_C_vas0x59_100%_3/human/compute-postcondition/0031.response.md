The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the current state of the variables other than `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, and if `n` is -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
