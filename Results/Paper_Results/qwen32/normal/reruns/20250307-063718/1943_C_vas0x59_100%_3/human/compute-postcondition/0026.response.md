In this case, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means it will always execute regardless of the program state. There are no conditions in the loop head that depend on any variables, so no adjustments are needed to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

Therefore, the state remains the same as right before the loop.

State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b]`**
