Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`**:
   - `bfs(a)` is a Breadth-First Search function that returns a tuple or a list. The first element of this return value is assigned to `d`.

2. **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**:
   - `func_1(d)` is a function that takes `d` as input and returns some value, which is assigned to `a`.

3. **`previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`**:
   - `bfs(a)` returns a tuple or a list. The second element of this return value is assigned to `previous`.

4. **`b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**:
   - `func_1(d)` is called again, and the result is assigned to `b`. Note that `b` and `a` will have the same value because they both result from `func_1(d)`.

5. **`path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`**:
   - `path_ba` is a list starting with `b` and followed by other elements `n1, n2, ..., nk`. The list continues until `n` becomes `-1`.

6. **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
   - `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - `ci` is 1 (though `ci` is not used in the print statement).

7. **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
   - `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
   - `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`.
   - `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
   - `ops` is a list containing `L` elements `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ..., (c1, L-1), (c2, L-1)]`.

### Code Snippet

```python
print(len(ops))
```

### Determining the Output

The print statement `print(len(ops))` will print the length of the list `ops`.

- If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**, `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`, which has 2 elements.
- If the length of `path_ba` is **even**, `ops` is a list with `L` elements, where `L` depends on the length of `path_ba`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- If `path_ba` is odd, `len(ops)` is 2.
- If `path_ba` is even, `len(ops)` is `L`, where `L` is calculated based on the length of `path_ba`.

However, since the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information, we need to consider the two possible scenarios:

**Output for odd `path_ba`**:
- Output: **2**

**Output for even `path_ba`**:
- Output: **L (where L is the length of ops calculated based on the length of path_ba)**

Given the information provided, the most precise description is:

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is 2 if the length of path_ba is odd, and calculated as described if the length of path_ba is even)**

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we can't determine a single numerical value. Therefore, we describe it based on the conditions given.

Final Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is 2 if the length of path_ba is odd, and calculated based on the length of path_ba if it is even)**
