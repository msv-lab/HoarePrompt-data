The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is the integer read from the input minus 1. Therefore, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` will now include `u` as an additional element.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now also has `u` appended to it; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is `u - 1`; `v` is the integer read from the input minus 1.**
