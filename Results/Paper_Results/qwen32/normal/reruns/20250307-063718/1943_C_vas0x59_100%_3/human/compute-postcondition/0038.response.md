To determine the output state, we will consider the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
```

Here's the initial state:
- `d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`; if `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`

Let's break down the code:
- `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `path_ba`.
- If `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]`, then `path_ba[-1]` is `n`.
- If `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, then `path_ba[-1]` is `n`.
- In both cases, `path_ba[-1]` is `n`.

So, the code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` translates to `n = previous[n]`.

This means the value of `n` is updated to the value stored in `previous` at the index `n`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`; if `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, `n` is `previous[n]`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is updated to the value stored in `previous` at the index `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
