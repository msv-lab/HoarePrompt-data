The code snippet calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns the result to `ci2`. Given that the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` will be an integer.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.**
