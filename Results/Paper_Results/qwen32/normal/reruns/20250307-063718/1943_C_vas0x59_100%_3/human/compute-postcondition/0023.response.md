The code snippet updates the value of `d` and introduces a new variable `previous` based on the result of `bfs(a)`. The initial value of `d` is derived from `bfs(0)` and `a` is computed from `func_1(d)`. After executing the code, `d` will hold the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, and `previous` will hold the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`**.
