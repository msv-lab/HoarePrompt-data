Let's break down the given code and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`d`**: The first value returned by `bfs(a)`.
2. **`a`**: The result of `func_1(d)`.
3. **`previous`**: The second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
4. **`b`**: The result of `func_1(d)`.
5. **`path_ba`**: A list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`.
6. **`ops`**: 
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `L` elements `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ..., (c1, L-1), (c2, L-1)]` where `ci1` and `ci2` are indices dividing the list into two equal parts, and `c1` and `c2` are the elements at these indices.

### Code Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

This statement iterates over each tuple in the `ops` list, applies a lambda function to each tuple, and prints the results, each on a new line. The lambda function adds 1 to the first element of each tuple and keeps the second element unchanged.

### Output Description

Based on the conditions provided for `ops`:

1. **If `path_ba` is odd**:
   - `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`.
   - The print statement will output:
     ```
     c + 1 0
     c + 1 1
     ```

2. **If `path_ba` is even**:
   - `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ..., (c1, L-1), (c2, L-1)]`.
   - The print statement will output:
     ```
     c1 + 1 1
     c2 + 1 1
     c1 + 1 3
     c2 + 1 3
     ...
     c1 + 1 L-1
     c2 + 1 L-1
     ```

### Final Output

Given the conditions, the output will depend on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even. Therefore, we need to describe the output in both scenarios:

Output: **If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be:
```
c + 1 0
c + 1 1
```
where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be:
```
c1 + 1 1
c2 + 1 1
c1 + 1 3
c2 + 1 3
...
c1 + 1 L-1
c2 + 1 L-1
```
where `c1` and `c2` are the middle elements of `path_ba`, and `L` is the length of `ops`.**
