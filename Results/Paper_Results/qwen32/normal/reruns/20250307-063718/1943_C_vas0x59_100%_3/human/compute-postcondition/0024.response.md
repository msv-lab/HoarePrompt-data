The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The value of `d` is already determined by the first value returned by `bfs(a)`. The variables `a` and `previous` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the execution of this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
