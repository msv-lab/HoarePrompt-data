The code snippet appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `u` already has `v-1` appended to it, and the list at index `v-1` has `u` appended to it. After executing the code, the list at index `u` will have `v` appended to it.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v-1` and `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v-1` has `u` appended to it; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer read from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer read from the input minus 2.**
