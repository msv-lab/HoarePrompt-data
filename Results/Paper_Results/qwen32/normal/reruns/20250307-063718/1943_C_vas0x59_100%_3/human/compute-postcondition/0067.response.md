The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 3 and `c2` is an element from the list `path_ba`, the new tuple `(c2, 3)` is added to the end of `ops`.

Given that `ops` initially contains five elements, after appending the new tuple, `ops` will now contain six elements.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing six elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)]`, `i` is 3.**
