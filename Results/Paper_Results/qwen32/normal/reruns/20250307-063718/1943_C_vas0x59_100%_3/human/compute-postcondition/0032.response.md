For the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Since the loop condition is always `True`, no variables in the loop head need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, and if `n` is -1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
