Postcondition: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is `[b, n]` if `n` is `-1`. If `n` is not `-1`, `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]`. `n` is `previous[n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
