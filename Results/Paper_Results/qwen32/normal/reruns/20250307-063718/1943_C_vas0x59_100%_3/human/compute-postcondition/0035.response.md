Postcondition: ***`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `n` is not `-1`, the state remains as described without breaking out of the loop.***

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both possible outcomes of the condition `n == -1`.
