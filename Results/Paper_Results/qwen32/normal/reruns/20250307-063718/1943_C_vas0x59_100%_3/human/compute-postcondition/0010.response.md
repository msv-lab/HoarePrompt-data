The code snippet `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Given that `u` was initially the first integer read from the input minus 1, after this operation, `u` will be the first integer read from the input minus 2.

The list `u2vs` and the value of `v` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the structure of `u2vs` are still valid.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now also has `u` appended to it; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer read from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer read from the input minus 1.**
