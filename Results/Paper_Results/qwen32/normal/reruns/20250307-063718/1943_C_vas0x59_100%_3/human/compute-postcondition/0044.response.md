Postcondition: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is an empty list.**
