The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 0. Therefore, the list `ops` will now contain this tuple.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is `[(c, 0)]`, `ci` is 1, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is 0**.
