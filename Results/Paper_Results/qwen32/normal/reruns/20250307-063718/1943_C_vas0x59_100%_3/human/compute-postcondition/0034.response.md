Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, and `n` is `previous[n]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `n` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
