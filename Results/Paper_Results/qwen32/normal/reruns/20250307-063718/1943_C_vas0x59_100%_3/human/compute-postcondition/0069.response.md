Postcondition: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`, `ci` is 1, and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, and `ops` is a list containing `L` elements `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ..., (c1, L-1), (c2, L-1)]`.**
