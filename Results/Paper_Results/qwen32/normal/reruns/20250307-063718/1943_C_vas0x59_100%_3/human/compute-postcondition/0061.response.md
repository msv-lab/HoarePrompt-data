The code appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains two elements: the original tuple `(c1, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing two elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]`.**
