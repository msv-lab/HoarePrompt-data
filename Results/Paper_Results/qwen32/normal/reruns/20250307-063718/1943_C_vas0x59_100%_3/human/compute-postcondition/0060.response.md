The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `ops` was initially an empty list. After the operation, `ops` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(c1, i)`. 

The other variables (`d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, `c2`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `ops` is a list containing one element `(c1, i)`**.
