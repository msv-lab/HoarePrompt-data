The code assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `n`. Given that `path_ba` is initialized as `[b]`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element of `path_ba`, which is `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b]`, `n` is `previous[b]`.**
