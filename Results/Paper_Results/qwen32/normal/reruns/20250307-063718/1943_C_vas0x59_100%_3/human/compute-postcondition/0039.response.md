The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, or `n` are modified by the `break` statement. The state of these variables remains the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`; if `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `path_ba` is `[b, n]`, `n` is `previous[n]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
