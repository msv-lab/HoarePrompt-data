The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This means that the values of `u` and `v` will be updated based on the input. The initial state described the structure of `u2vs` and the relationship between `u`, `v`, and `n`. However, the code snippet itself does not modify `u2vs` or `n`; it only updates `u` and `v`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will reflect the updated values of `u` and `v` as read from the input. The structure of `u2vs` and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now also has `u` appended to it; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer read from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer read from the input minus 1.**
