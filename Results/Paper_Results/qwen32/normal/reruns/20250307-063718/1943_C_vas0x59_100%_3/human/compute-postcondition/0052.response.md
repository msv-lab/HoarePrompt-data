The code snippet appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 2. Therefore, the new tuple `(c, 2)` is added to `ops`.

The initial state provides the following details:
- `d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd.
- `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`.
- `ci` is 1.
- `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- `i` is 2.

After the code snippet is executed, `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`, `ci` is 1, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is 2.**
