Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `u2vs` which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the vertex at the index of the outer list, `n` which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u` and `v` which are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge in the tree, with the constraint that 0 <= u, v < n. The function returns `None`.**
