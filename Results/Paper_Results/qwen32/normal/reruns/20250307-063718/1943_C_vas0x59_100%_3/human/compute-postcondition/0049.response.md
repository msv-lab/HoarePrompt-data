The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(ci + 1):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `ci` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk]` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` appended to `path_ba` before `n` becomes `-1`, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is `[(c, 0)]`, `ci` is 1, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is 1**
