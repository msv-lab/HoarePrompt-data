The code snippet provided initializes a list `path_ba` with the single element `b`. The values of `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is `[b]`**.
