Output State: **`d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`, or `[b, n]` if `n` is `-1`. After executing `path_ba.append(n)`, `path_ba` is `[b, n, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`, or `[b, n, n]` if `n` is `-1`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms:
- `d` remains the first value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` remains the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` becomes `[b, n, n, n]` if `n` is not `-1`, or `[b, n, n]` if `n` is `-1`.
- If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
