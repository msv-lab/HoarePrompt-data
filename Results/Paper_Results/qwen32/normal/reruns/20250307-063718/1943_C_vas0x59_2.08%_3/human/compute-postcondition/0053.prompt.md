Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` and `b` are the return values of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, which is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` and `b` are the return values of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, which is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` and `b` are the return values of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c, i_new)`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, which is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `i` is `i_new`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` and `b` are the return values of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c, i_new)`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, which is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ops` now includes the new tuple `(c, i_new)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
