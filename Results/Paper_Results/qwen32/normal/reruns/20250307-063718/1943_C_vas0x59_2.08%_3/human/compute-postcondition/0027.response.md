The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` assigns the value of `previous` at the index specified by the last element of `path_ba` to the variable `n`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
