The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, but this value is being overwritten by the user input. The variable `u2vs` (a list of lists representing the neighbors of each vertex in the tree) is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree; `n` is the integer input by the user.**
