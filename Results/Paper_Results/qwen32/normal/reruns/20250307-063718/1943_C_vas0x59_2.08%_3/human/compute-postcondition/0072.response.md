Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree, computes the longest path in the tree, and prints the number of operations and the operations needed to traverse this path in a specific manner. The operations are printed as pairs of integers, where the first integer is a node index (1-based) and the second integer is a step index. The function does not return any value.**
