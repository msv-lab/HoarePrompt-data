`u` is decremented by 1. The value of `v` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `u2vs` is constructed based on the initial values of `u` and `v`, and since `u` is now decremented, the list `u2vs` will reflect this change in its structure.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists where the sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v`, `u`, `u`, and the sublist at index `u` contains the elements `u` and `v`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` remains the same.**
