The code appends the value `v` to the sublist at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state:

- `u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists.
- The sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v`, `u`, `u`.
- The sublist at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `v`.
- `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2.
- `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
- `n` remains the same.

After executing the code `u2vs[u].append(v)`, the sublist at index `u` will now contain the elements `u`, `v`, `v`. All other sublists and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists where the sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v`, `u`, `u`, and the sublist at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `v`, `v`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2; `n` remains the same.**
