The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 and increments by 2 each time, stopping before `len(path_ba) - c1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to the next valid value, which is `i + 2`.

Let's determine the new value of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev + 2`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `(i_prev + 2) + 2 = i_prev + 4`.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(path_ba) - c1`. Therefore, `i_prev + 4` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` and now includes an additional tuple `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 4` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_prev + 4 < len(path_ba) - c1`**
