The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1`, `i`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`, and `path_ba` remain unchanged, except for `ops` which now includes the additional tuple.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` and now includes an additional tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 4` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_prev + 4 < len(path_ba) - c1`.**
