Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists where the sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v` and `u`, and the sublist at index `u` contains the elements `u` and `v`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**

Explanation: The sublist at index `u` originally contained only the element `u`. After the code `u2vs[u].append(v)` is executed, the sublist at index `u` now contains the elements `u` and `v`. All other sublists remain unchanged.
