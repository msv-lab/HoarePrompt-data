The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n - 1):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is the loop variable `_`, but since it is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition, we only need to consider the range and how it relates to the loop's continuation.

The loop will execute `n - 1` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one of these iterations. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can still execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs `n - 1` times, if we are at the start of the next iteration, it means that we have completed `k` iterations where `k` is less than `n - 1`. The loop will continue as long as `k < n - 1`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, its value is irrelevant to the state we need to describe. The only thing that matters is that the loop can still execute, which is determined by the range `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that we know the loop can still execute one more time.

State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists where the sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v` and `u`, and all other sublists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1**.
