To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `1`, `len(path_ba) - c1`, and `2`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists.
- `d` is a list of shortest distances.
- `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list of previous nodes.
- `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
- `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1, incrementing by 2 each time, and stops before `len(path_ba) - c1`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` must be adjusted to the next value in the range. Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`, provided that `i_prev + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `i_prev` and adjust it accordingly.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 2` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_prev + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`**.

To make it more concrete, let's assume `i_prev` is 1 (the first iteration). Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 3 where `3 < len(path_ba) - c1`**.

If `i_prev` were 3, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 5 where `5 < len(path_ba) - c1`**.

In general, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 2` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_prev + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`**.
