The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` was already assigned the return value of `func_1(d)` in the initial state, `b` will now hold the same value as `a`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`.**
