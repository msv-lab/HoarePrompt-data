Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`. If `n` equals `-1`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n` followed by the new value of `n`. `n` is now `previous[n]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. If `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and the new value of `n`, and `n` is now `previous[n]`. The list `path_ba` now includes the additional element `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
