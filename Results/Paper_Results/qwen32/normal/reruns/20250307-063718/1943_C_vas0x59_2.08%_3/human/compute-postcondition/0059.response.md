The code snippet appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c2` and `i` remain unchanged, but `ops` now includes the new tuple. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`, `path_ba`, `c1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
