Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and the new value of `n`. `n` is now `previous[n]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
