Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` and `b` are the return values of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`, and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (which is `len(path_ba) // 2`), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid `i` where `i` starts from `1` and increments by `2` until `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
