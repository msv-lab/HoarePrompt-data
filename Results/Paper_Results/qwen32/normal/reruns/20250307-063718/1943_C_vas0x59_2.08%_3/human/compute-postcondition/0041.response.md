The code snippet provided appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. This means that the list `path_ba` will now include the value of `n` at the end of its current elements. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) remain unchanged. The value of `n` itself is not modified by this operation.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`. If `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and the new value of `n`, and `n` is now `previous[n]`. The list `path_ba` now includes the additional element `n`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `path_ba` has been updated to include the current value of `n` at the end, while all other variables remain the same.
