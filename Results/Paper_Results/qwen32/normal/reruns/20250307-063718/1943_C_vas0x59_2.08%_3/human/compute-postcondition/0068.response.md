To determine the output of `print(len(ops))`, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ops` is constructed.

### Steps to Determine the Value of `ops`:

1. **Understanding `path_ba`:**
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order.
   - The length of `path_ba` can be either odd or even.

2. **Constructing `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**:
     - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples of the form `(c, i)`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`, and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
     - Therefore, the length of `ops` will be `ci + 1`, which is `len(path_ba) // 2 + 1`.

   - If the length of `path_ba` is **even**:
     - `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid `i` where `i` starts from `1` and increments by `2` until `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
     - The number of such tuples can be calculated by considering the range of `i`. Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `2`, the number of valid `i` values is `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) // 2 + 1`.
     - Simplifying, the length of `ops` will be `len(path_ba) // 2`.

### Conclusion:

- If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**, the length of `ops` is `len(path_ba) // 2 + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is **even**, the length of `ops` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `len(ops)`, but we can describe it based on the length of `path_ba`.

### Final Output:

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is len(path_ba) // 2 + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, and len(path_ba) // 2 if len(path_ba) is even)**
