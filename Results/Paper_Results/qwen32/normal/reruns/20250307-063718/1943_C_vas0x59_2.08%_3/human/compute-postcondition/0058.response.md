The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, but `c1` is calculated as `c2 - 1` where `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` sublists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` and `b` are return values of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous nodes, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from `b` to node `0` in reverse order with length greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
