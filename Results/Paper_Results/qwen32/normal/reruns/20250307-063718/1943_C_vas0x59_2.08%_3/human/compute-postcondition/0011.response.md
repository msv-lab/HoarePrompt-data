Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` sublists where the sublist at index `v` contains the elements `v` and `u`, and all other sublists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**

In simpler terms: The list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The variable `u` still holds the value of the first integer from the input minus 1. The variable `v` is now the second integer from the input minus 1.
