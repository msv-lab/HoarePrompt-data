To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand how the variables `ops` are constructed based on the conditions described.

### Analysis of the Initial State

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - `u2vs`: A list of `n` sublists, where each sublist at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. This represents the adjacency list of a graph.

2. **Shortest Distances:**
   - `d`: A list of shortest distances from node `0` to each node `i` as computed by a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

3. **Computed Values from `func_1(d)`:**
   - `a` and `b`: These are the return values of `func_1(d)`. The exact nature of `func_1` and the values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but they are used in constructing the `path_ba`.

4. **Shortest Path Information:**
   - `previous`: A list where each element at index `i` contains the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`.
   - `path_ba`: A list containing the nodes from `b` to node `0` in the shortest path, in reverse order.

5. **Operations List (`ops`):**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`, and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (which is `len(path_ba) // 2`), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid `i` where `i` starts from `1` and increments by `2` until `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Constructing `ops`

The `ops` list is constructed differently based on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even. The `print` statement uses `map` to format each tuple in `ops` as a string of the form `'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` and prints them separated by newlines.

### Output Description

Given the construction of `ops`, the output will be a series of formatted strings, each representing a tuple from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and the second element unchanged.

- If `path_ba` has an odd length, the output will be a list of `ci + 1` lines, each containing a number from `c + 1` and an index `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, the output will be a list of lines, each containing two numbers: `c1 + 1` and an index `i`, followed by `c2 + 1` and the same index `i`, for each valid `i`.

Since the exact values of `path_ba`, `a`, `b`, and the structure of `ops` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `ops`.

### Final Output

Output: **a series of formatted strings representing the tuples in `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and the second element unchanged, separated by newlines**.
