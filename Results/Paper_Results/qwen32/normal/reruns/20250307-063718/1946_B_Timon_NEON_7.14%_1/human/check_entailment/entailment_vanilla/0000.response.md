Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to perform exactly `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of `a` (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` such operations, with the result taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations:
1. **Empty Subarray**: Inserting the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) does not change the sum of the array.
2. **Positive Subarray**: Inserting the sum of a positive subarray increases the sum of the array.
3. **Negative Subarray**: Inserting the sum of a negative subarray decreases the sum of the array, so it's generally not beneficial unless we're forced to do so.

### Strategy:
- **Maximize Sum**: The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the sum of the maximum subarray (using Kadane's algorithm) to the array.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.
- **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   - This function correctly implements the modulo operation as required.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
               total_max_segment = segment
       if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
           total_max_segment = [-1]
       return total_max_segment
   ```
   - This function attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm. However, it does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm. Specifically, it does not reset `max_segment` correctly when a negative number is encountered, and it incorrectly handles the accumulation of `max_segment[0]`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum, and `func_3` is incomplete. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
