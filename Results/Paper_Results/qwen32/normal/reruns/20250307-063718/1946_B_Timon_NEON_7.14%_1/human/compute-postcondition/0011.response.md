The code snippet provided assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Given the initial conditions, `new_segment` is `True`. Therefore, after the assignment, `max_segment` will also be `True`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `arr` is still a list of integers with at least one element.
- `i` is still `0`.
- `new_segment` is still `True`.
- The first element of `arr` is still less than `0`.
- `max_segment[0]` is still less than or equal to `new_segment[0]` (this condition is now irrelevant because `max_segment` is no longer a list but a boolean).
- `segments_variants` still includes an additional element `[True, -1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is true, the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `max_segment` is true, and `segments_variants` includes an additional element `[True, -1]`.**
