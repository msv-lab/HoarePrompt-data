Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments. `max_sum` remains -1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`; otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`.**
