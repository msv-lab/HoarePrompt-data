Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
