Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is updated to include `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`, and all other variables retain their previous states as described.
