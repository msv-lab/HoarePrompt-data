The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `len(arr)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
