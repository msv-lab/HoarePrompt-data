The code snippet assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Therefore, `total_max_segment` will now hold the same value as `segment`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment (e.g., `segments_variants = [[0]]`), `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**
