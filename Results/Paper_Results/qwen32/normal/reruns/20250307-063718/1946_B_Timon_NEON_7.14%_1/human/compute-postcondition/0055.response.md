The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants` by combining `new_segment` with the last index of `arr`. Therefore, `segments_variants` will now include this new segment. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` remains -1.**
