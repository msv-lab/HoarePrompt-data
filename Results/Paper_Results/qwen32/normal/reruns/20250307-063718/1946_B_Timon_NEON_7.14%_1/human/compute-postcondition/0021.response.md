The code snippet assigns a list containing the first element of `arr` and the index `i` (which is 0) to the variable `new_segment`. This means `new_segment` will now hold a list with two elements: the first element of `arr` and the integer 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`**.
