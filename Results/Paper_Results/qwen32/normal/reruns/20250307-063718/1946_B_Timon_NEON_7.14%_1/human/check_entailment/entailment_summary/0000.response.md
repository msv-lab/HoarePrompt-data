### Reasoning:
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to verify that it meets the problem requirements and correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

The program consists of three functions, but only two are used in the main logic:
1. `func_1`: This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It simply returns the remainder when the input number is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
2. `func_2`: This function is supposed to find the segment (subarray) with the maximum sum in the given array. However, the implementation has some issues.

Let's analyze the `func_2` function:
- It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` as empty lists and a list with a single element `0` respectively.
- It iterates through the array `arr` and tries to find the maximum sum subarray.
- The logic for updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` seems flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum subarray starts from the middle of the array or ends at the end of the array.
- The `segments_variants` list is supposed to store all possible segments, but the way it is populated is incorrect.
- The `total_max_segment` is supposed to store the segment with the maximum sum, but the logic for finding it is flawed.

Given the flawed implementation of `func_2`, the main logic of the program is incorrect because it relies on `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray, which is not done correctly.

### Correctness:
Since the `func_2` function does not correctly find the maximum sum subarray, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
