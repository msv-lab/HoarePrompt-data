Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `new_segment` is a boolean. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]` and `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]` and `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`.**
