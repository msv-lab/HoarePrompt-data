Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` remains 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0] + arr[1]`. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. If `new_segment` is not empty and `arr[i] < 0`, `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[1], 1]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` includes a new entry which is `max_segment` concatenated with `[0]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is updated to include `new_segment + [i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2. If `arr[2] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is negated and `new_segment` is an empty list. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` after negation, `segments_variants` contains a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. If `arr[2] >= 0`, both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are increased by `arr[2]`. If `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is not defined in the else part, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[2]` and `2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
