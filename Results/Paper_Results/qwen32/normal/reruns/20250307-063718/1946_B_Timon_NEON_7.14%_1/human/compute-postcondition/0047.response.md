The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to `new_segment[0]`. Given that `i` is 2, `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`. Thus, `new_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[2]`.

The initial state indicates that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`, but this operation does not affect the current code snippet. Therefore, the only change is to `new_segment[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`, `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`.**
