Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment (e.g., `segments_variants = [[0]]`), `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment` if `segment[0]` is greater than `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
