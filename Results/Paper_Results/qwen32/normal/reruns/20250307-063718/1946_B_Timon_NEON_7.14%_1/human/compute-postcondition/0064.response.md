The only variable in the loop head is `segment`, which is iterated over `segments_variants`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If `segments_variants` has at least three segments, the loop will execute again for the third segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments, and `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`. For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must contain at least three segments, and `segment` will be updated to the third segment in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least three segments, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged, `segment` is the third segment in `segments_variants`**
