The code snippet provided modifies the `max_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to its first element. Given that `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equivalent to `arr[0]`. Therefore, `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[0]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `arr` remains a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `i` remains 0.
- `new_segment` remains as it was initially set: if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`; otherwise, `new_segment` remains `False`.
- `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is `False`, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.**
