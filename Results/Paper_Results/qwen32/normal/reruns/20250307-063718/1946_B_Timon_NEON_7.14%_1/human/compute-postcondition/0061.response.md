The only variable in the loop head is `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If `segments_variants` has more than one segment, the loop will execute again for the next segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment. To execute the loop one more time, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments. The `segment` variable will be updated to the next segment in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments (e.g., `segments_variants = [[0], [1]]`), `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment` if `segment[0]` is greater than `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`.**
