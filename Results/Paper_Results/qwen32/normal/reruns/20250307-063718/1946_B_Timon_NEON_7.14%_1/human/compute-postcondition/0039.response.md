The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- The conditions for `new_segment` are also updated based on the values of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.
- The conditions for `segments_variants` and `max_segment` are also updated.

Since `i` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.

The list `arr` does not need to be modified because it is the iterable over which the loop is running, and its elements are not being reassigned within the loop head.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2**.
