The value of `new_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_segment[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`.**
