The code snippet initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants`, or the condition `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`. The only change is that `new_segment` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `new_segment` is [], If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
