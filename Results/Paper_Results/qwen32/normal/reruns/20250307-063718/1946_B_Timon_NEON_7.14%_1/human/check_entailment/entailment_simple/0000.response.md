Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategy to Maximize the Sum

1. **Identify the Maximum Subarray Sum**: The most beneficial strategy is to identify the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the original array. This is because we can repeatedly insert this maximum sum into the array to maximize the total sum.
2. **Inserting the Maximum Sum**: By inserting the maximum sum repeatedly, the total sum can be significantly increased. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, inserting it multiple times will yield a large sum. If it is zero or negative, inserting it will not increase the sum.
3. **Computational Formula**: If the maximum subarray sum is `max_segment`, the new sum after `k` operations can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{new\_sum} = \text{max\_segment} \times 2^k + \text{sum\_of\_original\_array} - \text{max\_segment}
   \]
   The term \(2^k\) accounts for the repeated insertion of the maximum subarray sum. The term \(-\text{max\_segment}\) is subtracted because the maximum subarray sum is already included in the original sum.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and return it along with its last index.
   - The logic seems to be based on a modified version of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - The function returns a list containing the maximum sum and the last index of the subarray. If no positive subarray is found, it returns `[-1]`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It correctly implements the modulo operation.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the input for each test case, computes the maximum subarray sum using `func_2`, and then calculates the new sum using the formula described above.
   - The result is then printed after applying the modulo operation using `func_1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Negative Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The program sets `max_segment[0]` to 0 if it is -1, which is incorrect. If the maximum subarray sum is negative, it should remain negative, as inserting a negative sum does not increase the total sum.
   - The correct approach is to use the actual maximum subarray sum, even if it is negative, and handle the case where the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative separately.

2. **Formula Implementation**:
   - The formula used in the main logic is correct if the maximum subarray sum is positive. However, if the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the formula should be adjusted to avoid unnecessary additions.
   - Specifically, if the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the new sum should simply be the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not entirely correct. The handling of the maximum subarray sum and the formula implementation need adjustments to correctly handle all cases, especially when the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
