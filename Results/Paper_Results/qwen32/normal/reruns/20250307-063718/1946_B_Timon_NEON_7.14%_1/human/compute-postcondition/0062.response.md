Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments (e.g., `segments_variants = [[0], [1]]`), `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`, and `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `total_max_segment` is now the second segment in `segments_variants`. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
