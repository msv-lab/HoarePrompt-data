The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and a list containing the value `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the value being appended is `new_segment + [1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`.**
