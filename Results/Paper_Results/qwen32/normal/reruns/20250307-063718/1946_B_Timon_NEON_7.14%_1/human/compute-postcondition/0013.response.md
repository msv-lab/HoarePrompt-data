Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, and the first element of `arr` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` has a new element which is `max_segment + [-1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is true, and `segments_variants` includes an additional element `[True, -1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `new_segment` is reassigned to an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
