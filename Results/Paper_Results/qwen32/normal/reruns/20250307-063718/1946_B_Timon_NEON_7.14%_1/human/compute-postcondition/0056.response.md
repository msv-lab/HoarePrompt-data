The code snippet assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`. The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**
