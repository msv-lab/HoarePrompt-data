The code snippet modifies the first element of `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. The values of `arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, and the condition for `segments_variants` remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `new_segment` is [], `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
