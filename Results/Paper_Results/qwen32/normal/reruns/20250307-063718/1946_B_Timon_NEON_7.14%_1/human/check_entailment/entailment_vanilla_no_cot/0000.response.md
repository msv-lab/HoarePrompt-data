Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the required operations to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Additionally, the function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices, but it does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when all elements are negative.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct program should do:

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Identify the maximum subarray sum (using Kadane's algorithm or a similar approach).
3. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, use it to maximize the sum of the array by adding it to the array `k` times. If it's negative, the best strategy is to add zeros (by using empty subarrays).
4. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The current implementation does not include these steps and is therefore incorrect.
