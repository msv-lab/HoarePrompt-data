The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by extending `max_segment` with the index `len(arr) - 1`. 

Given that `max_segment` holds a segment with the highest sum and its last index, and `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments, the new segment is added to `segments_variants`.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` remains -1.**
