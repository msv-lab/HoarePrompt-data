Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not complete the task as described in the problem statement. The code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but there is no function `func_3` defined, and the logic for performing the operations to maximize the sum of the array is missing.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does and what it lacks:

1. **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a utility function that would be useful for ensuring the result stays within the required modulo range, but it is not used in the current code.

2. **func_2**: This function seems to be attempting to find the maximum sum subarray in the given array. However, it does not correctly handle all edge cases, and even if it did, it does not perform the operations described in the problem (i.e., inserting the sum of a subarray into the array).

3. **func_3**: This function is not defined in the provided code. According to the problem description, this function should perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

The main logic to solve the problem involves the following steps:
- Calculate the sum of all positive numbers in the array. This is because adding positive sums will always increase the total sum.
- Use the maximum sum subarray logic to find the best subarray to add repeatedly.
- Perform the operations by adding the maximum sum subarray to the array `k` times.
- Ensure the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since `func_3` is missing and the current code does not implement the required logic to perform the operations, the program is incorrect.

Here is an example of a potential input that the current code does not handle correctly:
Input:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
Expected Output:
```
96
```
The current code does not perform the operations to achieve this output. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
