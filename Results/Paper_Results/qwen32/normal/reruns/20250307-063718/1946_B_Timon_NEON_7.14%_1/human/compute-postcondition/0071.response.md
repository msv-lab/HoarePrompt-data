Output State: **The program returns `total_max_segment` which holds the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.**

This means that the function will return the segment with the highest sum from the list `segments_variants`. If this segment contains only one element, it will be replaced with the list `[-1]`.
