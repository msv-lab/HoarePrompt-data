Postcondition: **After all iterations, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`. All other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.**
