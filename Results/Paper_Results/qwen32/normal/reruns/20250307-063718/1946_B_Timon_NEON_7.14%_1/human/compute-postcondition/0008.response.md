The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by concatenating `max_segment` with a list containing the value `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `i - 1` evaluates to `-1`. Therefore, the new list added to `segments_variants` is `max_segment + [-1]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, the first element of `arr`, and `max_segment[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is true, the first element of `arr` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`. Additionally, `segments_variants` has a new element which is `max_segment + [-1]`.**
