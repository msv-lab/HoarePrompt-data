To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies `total_max_segment`. The loop iterates over each segment in `segments_variants` and updates `total_max_segment` if the current segment has a higher sum than the current `total_max_segment`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, let's break down the final state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment.
   - `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index.
   - `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - For each segment in `segments_variants`, if the segment's sum (`segment[0]`) is greater than the sum of `total_max_segment` (`total_max_segment[0]`), `total_max_segment` is updated to the current segment.
   - This process continues until all segments in `segments_variants` have been evaluated.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After all iterations, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`.
   - All other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`.**

In simpler terms, the only change from the initial state is that `total_max_segment` will be updated to the segment with the highest sum from the list of segments in `segments_variants`. All other variables stay the same.
