Output State: **After all iterations, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`, and the length of `total_max_segment` will be 1. All other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement. `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.**

In simple terms, `total_max_segment` is now `[-1]`, and all other variables remain as they were before.
