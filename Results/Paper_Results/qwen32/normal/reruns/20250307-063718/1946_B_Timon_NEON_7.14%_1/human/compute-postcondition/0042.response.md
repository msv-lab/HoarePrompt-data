The code snippet assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, `max_segment` is `new_segment`.**
