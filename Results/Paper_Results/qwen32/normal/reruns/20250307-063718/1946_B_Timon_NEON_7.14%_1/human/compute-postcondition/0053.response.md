To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Behavior Recap:
- **Initialization**: `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - For each element in `arr`, the loop checks if `new_segment` is not empty.
  - If `arr[i]` is negative and `new_segment` is not empty, it compares `max_segment` and `new_segment`. It appends the appropriate segment to `segments_variants` and updates `max_segment` if necessary.
  - If `arr[i]` is non-negative, it adds `arr[i]` to both `max_segment` and `new_segment`.
  - If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[i]` is non-negative, it initializes `new_segment` with `[arr[i], i]`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed every element in `arr`. The final state of the variables will be:
- `arr`: remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- `new_segment`: might be an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment.
- `max_segment`: will contain the segment with the highest sum and the index of its last element.
- `segments_variants`: will contain all segments that were considered as potential maximum segments during the loop.
- `max_sum`: remains -1 as it is not updated within the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
By the end of the loop, `new_segment` could be empty if the last element was negative or if no non-negative segment was ongoing. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum and its last index. `segments_variants` will list all the segments that were evaluated as potential maximum segments during the iteration. `max_sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments, and `max_sum` remains -1.**
