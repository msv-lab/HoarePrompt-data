Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `new_segment` is true. The first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0; `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`; `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

In natural language: The list `arr` remains unchanged and still contains at least one element with the first element being greater than or equal to 0. The variable `i` remains 0. The variable `new_segment` remains true. The value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. Additionally, `new_segment[0]` has been updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, which is effectively `new_segment[0] + arr[0]` since `i` is 0.
