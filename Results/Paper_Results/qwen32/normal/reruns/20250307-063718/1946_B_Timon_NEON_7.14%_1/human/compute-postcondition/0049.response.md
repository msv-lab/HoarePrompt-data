The code snippet creates a new list `new_segment` that contains the element at index `i` from the list `arr` and the value of `i` itself. Given that `i` is 2, `new_segment` will be a list containing the element at index 2 of `arr` and the integer 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[2]` and `2`.**
