Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0] + arr[1]`. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`.**

In simpler terms, `max_segment[0]` now includes the value of `arr[1]` in addition to its previous value and `arr[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` was non-negative, in which case `new_segment` is now `[arr[0], 0]`. If `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`.
