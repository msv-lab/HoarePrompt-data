Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least three segments, `max_sum` remains -1. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the third segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. `segment` is the third segment in `segments_variants`.**
