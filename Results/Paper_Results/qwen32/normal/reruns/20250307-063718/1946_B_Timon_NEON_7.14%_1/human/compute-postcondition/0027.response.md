Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If the first element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` was initially `False` and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is updated to include `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Natural language: The state of `arr` and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated by adding the first element of `arr`. The state of `new_segment` depends on the first element of `arr`: if it is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` has been updated by adding the first element of `arr`, and if `new_segment` was initially `False`, it is now `[arr[0], 0]`. The list `segments_variants` has been updated to include the concatenation of `new_segment` with `[i - 1]`.
