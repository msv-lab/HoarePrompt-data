The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Therefore, `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least three segments, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is the third segment in `segments_variants`, `segment` is the third segment in `segments_variants`**.
