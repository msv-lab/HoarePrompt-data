Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2. If `arr[2] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is negated and `new_segment` is an empty list. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` after negation, `segments_variants` contains a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. If `arr[2] >= 0`, both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are increased by `arr[2]`. If `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is not defined in the else part, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[2]` and `2`.**
