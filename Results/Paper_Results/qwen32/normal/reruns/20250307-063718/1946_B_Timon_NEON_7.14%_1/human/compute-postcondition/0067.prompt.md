Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` contains all segments evaluated as potential maximum segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment (e.g., `segments_variants = [[0]]`), `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment` if `segment[0]` is greater than `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments. `max_sum` remains -1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`; otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the last non-negative segment, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum and its last index, `segments_variants` must contain at least three segments, `max_sum` remains -1. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the third segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. `segment` is the third segment in `segments_variants`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
