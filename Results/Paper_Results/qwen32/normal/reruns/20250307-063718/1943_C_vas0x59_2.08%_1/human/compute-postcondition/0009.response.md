The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them into `u` and `v`, and assigns these values to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state describes the structure of the list `u2vs` and the conditions for `n`, `u`, and `v`, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided. The only changes are the assignments to `u` and `v` from the input.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, u]`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `u` and `v` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
