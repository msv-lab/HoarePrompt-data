To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the purpose of the loop. The loop is designed to build an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph. Each iteration reads a pair of integers, representing an edge between two vertices in the graph, and updates the adjacency list accordingly.

Given that the loop runs `n - 1` times, it processes `n - 1` edges. After all iterations, the adjacency list `u2vs` will fully represent the graph with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, which forms a tree.

Here's the final state of `u2vs` after the loop completes:

- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists. Each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.
- Each vertex `u` will have a list of vertices `v` that are directly connected to it, and vice versa.

Given the previous outputs, we can infer the final state by generalizing the pattern:

**Output State:** `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree. Each pair of vertices `(u, v)` will have `v - 1` in the list at index `u - 1` and `u - 1` in the list at index `v - 1`.

In simple terms, the final state of `u2vs` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, where each vertex points to all its directly connected neighbors.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.**
