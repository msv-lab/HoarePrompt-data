The code snippet appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `i` is 3. Therefore, the new tuple to be appended is `(c2 - 1, 3)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` to all vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c2 - 1, 3)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and must be at least 3; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3.**
