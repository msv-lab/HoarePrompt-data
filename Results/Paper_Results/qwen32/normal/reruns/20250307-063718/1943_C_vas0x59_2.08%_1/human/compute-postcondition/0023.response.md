Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function.**

In simpler terms, the `d` list now contains distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, and `previous` contains the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a`. The `u2vs` list and the initial `a` remain unchanged.
