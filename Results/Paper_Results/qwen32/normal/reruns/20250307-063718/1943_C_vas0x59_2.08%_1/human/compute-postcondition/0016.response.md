Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` and `v` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, v, u]`.**

In this output state, the value of `u` has been decremented by 1, reflecting the effect of the code `u -= 1`. The other variables and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
