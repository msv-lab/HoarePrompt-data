The given code snippet appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The variables `c` and `i` are not defined in the provided initial state, so we will assume that `i` is a variable that was previously defined in the context of the code not provided here.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only change is that the list `ops` will now contain the tuple `(c, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, with the length of `path_ba` being odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.**
