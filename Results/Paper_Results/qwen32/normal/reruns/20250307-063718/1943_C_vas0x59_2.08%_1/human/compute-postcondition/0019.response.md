Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1`, `v`, and `v` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2; the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` contains `[v - 1, v, u, u]`.**

Explanation: The list at index `v` in `u2vs` originally contains `[v - 1, v, u]`. After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list at index `v` is updated to `[v - 1, v, u, u]`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
