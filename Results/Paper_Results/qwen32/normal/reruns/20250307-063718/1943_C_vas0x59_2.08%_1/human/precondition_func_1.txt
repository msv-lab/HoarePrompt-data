u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the tree is represented by its edges such that for each edge (u, v), both u and v are vertices in the tree and u2vs[u] contains v and u2vs[v] contains u.
