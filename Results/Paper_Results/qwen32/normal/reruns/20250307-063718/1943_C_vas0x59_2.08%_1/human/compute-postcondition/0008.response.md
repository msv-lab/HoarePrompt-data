The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the range, which is `n - 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `n` and the loop counter are related.

Given:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` appended to it.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `u` is `u - 1`.
- `v` is `v - 1`.
- The list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, u]`.

The loop will execute `n - 1` times. After each iteration, the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is effectively `n - 1`, `n - 2`, ..., `1`) decreases by 1. At the start of the next iteration, the loop counter will be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop counter is not explicitly represented in the state, we focus on `n` and how it affects the loop continuation. If the loop has executed `k` times, the loop will execute `n - 1 - k` more times. At the start of the next iteration, `n` remains the same, but the effective loop counter decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of `u2vs`, `n`, `u`, and `v`, except that the loop is one iteration closer to completion.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is `u - 1`; `v` is `v - 1`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, u]`**.
