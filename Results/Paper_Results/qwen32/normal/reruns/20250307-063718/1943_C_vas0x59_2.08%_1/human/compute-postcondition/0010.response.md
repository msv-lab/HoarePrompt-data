The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The other variables and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, u]`.**
