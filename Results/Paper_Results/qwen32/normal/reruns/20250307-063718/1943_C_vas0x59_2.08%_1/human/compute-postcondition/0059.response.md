The code snippet appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the tuple `(c2, 1)` is added to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1.**
