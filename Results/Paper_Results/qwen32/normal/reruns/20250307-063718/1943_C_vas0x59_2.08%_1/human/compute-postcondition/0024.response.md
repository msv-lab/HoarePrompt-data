The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will now hold the value that `func_1(d)` returns. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
