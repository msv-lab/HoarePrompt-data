#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of vertices and the edges of a tree, constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, and then determines the longest path in the tree. It calculates a series of operations based on the length of this longest path and prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves. Each operation is a tuple indicating a vertex and a distance. The function returns None.
