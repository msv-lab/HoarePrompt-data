The value of `v` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` will now contain `[v, u]` where `v` is the new value of `v`, and the list at index `v` in `u2vs` will contain `[v - 1, v, u]` where `v` is the new value of `v`. The values of `u2vs`, `n`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` and `v` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2; the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, v, u]`.**
