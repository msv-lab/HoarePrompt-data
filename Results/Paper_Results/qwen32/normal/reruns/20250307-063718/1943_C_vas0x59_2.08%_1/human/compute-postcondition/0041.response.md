The code snippet `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. This means that the list `path_ba` will now include the newly appended value of `n` at the end. Other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.

If `n` was originally -1, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but since the append operation is executed before the break, the value -1 is still appended to `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n` and now includes the newly appended `n`. If `n` was originally -1, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without updating `n`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `previous[n]`.**
