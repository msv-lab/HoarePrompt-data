Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, (L - 1) // 2)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `L` is the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (3, 7), (4, 7)`.**
