The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 1, the tuple `(c, 1)` is added to `ops`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, with the length of `path_ba` being odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c, 1)`; `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 1**.
