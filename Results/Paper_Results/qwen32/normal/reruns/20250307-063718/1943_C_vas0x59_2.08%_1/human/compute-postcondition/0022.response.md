To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it takes the list `d` (distances from vertex `0` to all vertices in the tree) and returns some value `a` based on it.

Given that the function `func_1` is not specified, we can only infer that `a` will be assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. The values of `u2vs` and `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided information.

Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged `u2vs` and `d`, and the newly assigned `a`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
