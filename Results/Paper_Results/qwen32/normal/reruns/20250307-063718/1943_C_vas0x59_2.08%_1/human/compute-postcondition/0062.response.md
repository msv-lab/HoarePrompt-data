Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` to all vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and must be at least 3; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3.`**

The list `ops` has been updated to include an additional tuple `(c2, 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
