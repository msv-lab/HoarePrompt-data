The code snippet `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `u2vs`.

Initial State: 
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` and `v` appended to it.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2.
- `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
- The list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`.
- The list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, v, u]`.

After executing the code snippet, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will have `v` appended to it. Therefore, the list at index `u` will now contain `[v - 1, v, v]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1`, `v`, and `v` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2; the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` contains `[v - 1, v, u]`.**
