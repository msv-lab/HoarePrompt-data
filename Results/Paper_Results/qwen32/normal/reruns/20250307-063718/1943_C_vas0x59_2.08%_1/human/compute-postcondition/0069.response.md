To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`u2vs`**: A list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.
2. **`d`**: A list of distances from vertex `a` to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function.
3. **`a`**: The result of `func_1(d)`.
4. **`previous`**: A list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function.
5. **`b`**: The result of `func_1(d)`.
6. **`path_ba`**: A list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order.
7. **`ops`**: A list of tuples based on the length of `path_ba`:
    - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, (L - 1) // 2)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `L` is the length of `path_ba`.
    - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains the tuples `(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (3, 7), (4, 7)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Analysis:
- The `map` function applies a lambda function to each element of the `ops` list.
- The lambda function takes a tuple `x` and formats it to a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
- The `*` operator unpacks the results of the `map` function so that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

### Possible Values of `ops`:
1. **If `path_ba` is odd**:
    - Suppose `path_ba` has length `L` and the middle element is `c`.
    - `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, (L - 1) // 2)]`.
    - The formatted output for each tuple `(c, i)` will be `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

2. **If `path_ba` is even**:
    - `ops` will be `[(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (3, 7), (4, 7)]`.
    - The formatted output for each tuple `(3, j)` and `(4, j)` will be `f'4 {j}'` and `f'5 {j}'` respectively.

### Output:
- If `path_ba` is odd, the output will be a series of lines where each line is `c + 1` followed by a space and an incrementing integer from `0` to `(L - 1) // 2`.
- If `path_ba` is even, the output will be:
    ```
    4 1
    5 1
    4 3
    5 3
    4 5
    5 5
    4 7
    5 7
    ```

Since the exact nature of `path_ba` (odd or even) and its middle element `c` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **4 1\n5 1\n4 3\n5 3\n4 5\n5 5\n4 7\n5 7 (if `path_ba` is even) or a series of lines `c+1 i` for i from 0 to (L-1)//2 (if `path_ba` is odd)**
