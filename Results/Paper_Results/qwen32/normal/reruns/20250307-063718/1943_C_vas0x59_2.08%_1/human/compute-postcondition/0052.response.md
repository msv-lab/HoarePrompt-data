The code snippet provided appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, and `i` is 2. The length of `path_ba` is odd, and `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, which indicates the index of the middle element in `path_ba`. 

The only change in the state is the addition of the new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, with the length of `path_ba` being odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c, 2)`; `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 2.**
