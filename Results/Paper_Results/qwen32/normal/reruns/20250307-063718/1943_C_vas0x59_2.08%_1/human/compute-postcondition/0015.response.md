The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This means that the values of `u` and `v` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state described other variables and their relationships, but these will remain unchanged except for `u` and `v`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` has `v - 1` and `v` appended to it; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; the list at index `v + 1` in `u2vs` contains `[v, u]`; the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now contains `[v - 1, v, u]`. The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively.**
