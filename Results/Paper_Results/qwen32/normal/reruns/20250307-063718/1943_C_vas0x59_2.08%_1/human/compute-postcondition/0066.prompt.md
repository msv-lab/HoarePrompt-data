Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` to all vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and must be at least 3; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` to all vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c2 - 1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and must be at least 3; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
