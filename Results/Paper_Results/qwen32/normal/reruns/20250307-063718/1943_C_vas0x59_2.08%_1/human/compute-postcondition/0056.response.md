The code snippet assigns the value of `c2 - 1` to the variable `c1`. Given that `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is an integer. Therefore, `c1` will be one less than `c2`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from the vertex `a` (result of `func_1(d)`) to all vertices in the tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path tree, in that order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
