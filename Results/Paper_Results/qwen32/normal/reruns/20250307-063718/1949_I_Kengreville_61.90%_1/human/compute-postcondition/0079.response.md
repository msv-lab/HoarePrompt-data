Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers, and `ok` is a boolean value indicating whether at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in a non-zero `c1`. Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, it means at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in a non-zero `c1`; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.**
