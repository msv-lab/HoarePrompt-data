The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `dy`. Specifically, `dy` is updated to be `y[i] - y[j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so the new value of `dy` will be `y[i] - y[2]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[2]`.**
