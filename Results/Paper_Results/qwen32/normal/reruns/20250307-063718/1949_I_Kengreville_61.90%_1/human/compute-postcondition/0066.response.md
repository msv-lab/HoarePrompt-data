Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef1[2]` is `1`, `nodes` is a list with at least two elements, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[j]`, `c1` is `1`, `j` is the next element in `nodes` after 2, `dfs(i)` has been called**.

In natural language: The value of `c0` is now equal to `coef0[j]`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
