### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that the following conditions are met:
1. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other.
2. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. Here's a detailed breakdown of their functionalities:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the input which includes the number of disks and their respective centers and radii.
   - Initializes several lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`) to store the centers, radii, visited status, coefficients, and nodes of the connected components respectively.
   - Iterates through each disk and performs a DFS if the disk has not been visited yet.
   - After performing DFS for each unvisited disk, it calculates the sum of coefficients `c0` and `c1` for the nodes in the current connected component.
   - If `c1` is non-zero for any connected component, it sets `ok` to `True`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ok` is `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

2. **Function `dfs`**:
   - Performs a Depth-First Search starting from a given disk index `i`.
   - Marks the disk as visited and adds it to the list of nodes in the current connected component.
   - For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is tangent to the current disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for disk `j` based on the relationship between the radii of disks `i` and `j`.
   - Recursively calls itself to visit all disks that are tangent to disk `j`.

### Analysis:
- The DFS function correctly identifies all disks that are part of the same connected component based on tangency.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to maintain the relationship between the radii of the disks in the connected component.
- The condition `c1 != 0` is used to check if it is possible to adjust the radii in such a way that the sum of the radii decreases. This is because if `c1` is non-zero, it implies that there is a way to assign new radii to the disks in the connected component such that the sum of the radii is strictly less than the original sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
