Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, `dfs(j)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(j)` has been invoked with `j` set to 2. No specific changes to the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1` are provided in the code snippet, except for the computation of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` prior to the function call. The function call itself does not alter the state of these variables but indicates that the depth-first search (dfs) algorithm is being applied starting from node `j`.
