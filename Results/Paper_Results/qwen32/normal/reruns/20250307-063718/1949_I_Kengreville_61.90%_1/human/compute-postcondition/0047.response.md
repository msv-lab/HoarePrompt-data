The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` adds the value of `coef0[j]` to `c0`. Given that `j` is 2, this means `c0` will be updated to its previous value plus `coef0[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2], `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`, `c1` is `coef1[1]`, `j` is 2**.

In natural language: The value of `c0` has been updated to the sum of its previous value (`coef0[1]`) and `coef0[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
