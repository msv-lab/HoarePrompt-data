Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `dy` has been updated to be the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`, which is `y[i] - y[0]` since `j` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
