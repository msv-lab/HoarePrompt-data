The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `c1` will be incremented by `coef1[1]`.

Initially:
- `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`
- `j` is 1

After the operation:
- `c1` becomes `coef1[1] + coef1[2] + coef1[1]`, which simplifies to `2 * coef1[1] + coef1[2]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `2 * coef0[1] + coef0[2]`; `c1` is `2 * coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 1**.
