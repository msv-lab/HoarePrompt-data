Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where `x[j]` is the first integer from the j-th input, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where `y[j]` is the second integer from the j-th input, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where `r[j]` is the third integer from the j-th input, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers, and `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `c1` was not equal to `0`, where `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[i]` was `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, or `ok`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2], `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`, `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`, `j` is 2 if `visited[1]` was `False` and is now `True`. If `visited[1]` was already `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, or `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`; `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list of integers; `ok` is `True`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1[2]` is `1`, `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`, and `dfs(i)` has been called. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `c0`, `c1`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
