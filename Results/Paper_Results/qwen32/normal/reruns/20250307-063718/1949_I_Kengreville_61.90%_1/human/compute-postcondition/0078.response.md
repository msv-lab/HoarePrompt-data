Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where all elements are `True`.
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`.
- `nodes` is a list of integers.
- `ok` is `False` since no call to `dfs(i)` resulted in a non-zero `c1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is directly printed to the console.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
