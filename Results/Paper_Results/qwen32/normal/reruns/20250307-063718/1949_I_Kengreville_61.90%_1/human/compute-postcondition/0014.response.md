Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dx` is `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `coef0[j]` has been updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
