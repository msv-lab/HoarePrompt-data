n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef0 and coef1 are lists of None values that will be updated during the execution, and nodes is a list that will store indices of nodes during the dfs traversal.
