### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summaries to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Tangency Preservation**: Disks that are tangent must remain tangent after radius adjustments.
2. **Non-overlapping**: No two disks should overlap.
3. **Decreasing Sum of Radii**: The sum of all radii must strictly decrease.

#### Program Analysis:
- **DFS Implementation**:
  - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to find connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
  - The `visited` list keeps track of which disks have been visited during the DFS.
  - The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are used to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.
  - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. This condition is correct for checking external tangency, but it does not check for internal tangency. However, for the problem's requirements, the current condition is sufficient because the problem specifies that disks do not overlap but can be tangent externally.

- **Checking Conditions**:
  - The main function `func_1` initializes the necessary data structures and iterates over each disk to perform DFS if it hasn't been visited.
  - After performing DFS for each connected component, it checks if `c1 != 0`, which indicates that the sum of the coefficients `coef1` is non-zero. This condition is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency.
  - If any connected component satisfies this condition, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary for `dfs` is accurate. It correctly describes the function's behavior in terms of marking disks as visited, collecting indices of disks in the same connected component, and updating `coef0` and `coef1`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Global Variables**: While the use of global variables is generally discouraged, in this context, it seems to be used correctly within the scope of the functions. The functions are not designed to be called multiple times with different states, so this is not a critical issue.
2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS implementation is correct for the problem's requirements. It correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
3. **Adjusting Radii**: The program does not explicitly adjust the radii but instead checks if it is possible to adjust them. This is sufficient for the problem's requirements.
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program appears to handle edge cases correctly, such as when disks are tangent in a line or when there is only one disk.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks to meet the problem's requirements. The original assessment incorrectly identifies several issues that are not critical for the problem's solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
