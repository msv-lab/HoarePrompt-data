The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is iterated over the elements of the list `nodes`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` for the next iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the first element of `nodes`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `nodes` to iterate over.

Since `j` is the first element of `nodes` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` in the next iteration should be the second element of `nodes`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `nodes` must have at least two elements. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ok` is a boolean, `c0` is `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `2 * coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element of `nodes`**
