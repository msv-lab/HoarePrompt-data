Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `dfs` use global variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. This is not a good practice and can lead to bugs, especially if the functions are called multiple times or if there are other parts of the program that use the same variable names.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is supposed to explore the graph of tangent disks and calculate the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to determine if the radii can be adjusted. However, the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented. The program does not ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while keeping the disks tangent.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Tangency**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent, but it does not account for the possibility of disks being tangent from the outside or the inside. The correct condition should check if the distance between the centers is equal to the sum or the absolute difference of the radii.

4. **Adjusting Radii**: The program does not actually adjust the radii of the disks. It only checks if it is possible to adjust the radii, but the logic for adjusting them is missing.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when there is only one disk or when all disks are tangent to each other in a complex configuration.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```

In this case, the disks are tangent to each other in a line. The program should return "YES" because we can adjust the radii to make them smaller while keeping them tangent. However, the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements for all possible cases.
