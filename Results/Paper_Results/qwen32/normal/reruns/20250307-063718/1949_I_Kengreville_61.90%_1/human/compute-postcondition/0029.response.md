The code snippet provided increments the variable `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is the first element of the `nodes` list, and `c1` is initially set to `coef1[j]`. After the operation, `c1` will be the sum of its initial value and `coef1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ok` is a boolean, `c0` is `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `2 * coef1[j]`, `j` is the first element of `nodes`.**

In natural language: The value of `c1` is now twice the value of `coef1[j]`, where `j` is the first element of the `nodes` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
