Postcondition: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and `dfs(j)` is called. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0`, `coef1`, or the state of `visited`.**
