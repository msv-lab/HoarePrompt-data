Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`; `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list of integers; `ok` is `True`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1[2]` is `1`, `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`, and `dfs(i)` has been called. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `c0`, `c1`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
