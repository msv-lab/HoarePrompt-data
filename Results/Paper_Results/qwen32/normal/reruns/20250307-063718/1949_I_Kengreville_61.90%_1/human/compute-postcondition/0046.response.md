The only object in the loop head is the variable `j` and the list `nodes`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `nodes` contains the integer 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must contain at least one more element that `j` can iterate over.

Since `j` has already taken the value 1, `nodes` should be adjusted to include another element that `j` can take in the next iteration. Let's assume the next element in `nodes` is 2 for the sake of this example.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2], `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1]`, `c1` is `coef1[1]`, `j` is 2**
