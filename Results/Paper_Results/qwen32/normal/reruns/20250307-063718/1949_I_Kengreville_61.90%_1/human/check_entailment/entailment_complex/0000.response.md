### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency between disks that were originally tangent. 

The solution approach involves:
1. Reading the input which includes the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
2. Using Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
3. Within each connected component, the DFS updates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) that help in determining if it's possible to adjust the radii in the desired manner.
4. The main function checks if there exists at least one connected component where the sum of coefficients `c1` is non-zero, which would imply that the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions.

### Analysis of the Functions:

- **func_1()**:
  - Initializes the necessary data structures.
  - Reads the input values for the number of disks and their respective positions and radii.
  - Iterates through each disk, invoking DFS for any unvisited disk to explore all connected components.
  - For each connected component, it calculates the sum of coefficients `c0` and `c1`.
  - If `c1` is non-zero for any component, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

- **dfs(i)**:
  - Marks the current disk as visited.
  - Adds the current disk to the list of nodes in the current connected component.
  - Iterates through all disks to find disks that are tangent to the current disk (i.e., the sum of their radii equals the Euclidean distance between their centers).
  - Recursively visits these tangent disks, updating the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to maintain the relationships between the radii of the disks in the connected component.

### Correctness:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described above. It uses DFS to explore connected components of tangent disks and calculates the necessary coefficients to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions. The logic for checking tangency and updating coefficients is sound, and the final decision to print "YES" or "NO" is based on whether any connected component has a non-zero sum of `c1`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
