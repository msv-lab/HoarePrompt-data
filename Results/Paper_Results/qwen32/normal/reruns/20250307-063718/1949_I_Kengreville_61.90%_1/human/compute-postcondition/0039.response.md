The code snippet `nodes = []` simply reassigns the variable `nodes` to an empty list. This does not affect any other variables or their values. The initial state specifies that `nodes` was a list of integers, but after this line, it is now an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `c1` was not equal to `0`, where `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[i]` was `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, or `ok`. `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1.**
