Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers, `ok` is `True` if at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in a non-zero `c1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The loop variable `i` will have reached `n-1`, meaning the loop has iterated over all elements from `0` to `n-1`.
- The `visited` list will have all `True` values, indicating that every node has been visited.
- The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will have been updated based on the `dfs` calls.
- The `nodes` list will contain the nodes visited during the last `dfs` call.
- The `ok` variable will be `True` if any of the `dfs` calls resulted in a non-zero `c1` value, meaning at least one node had a non-zero coefficient in `coef1`.
