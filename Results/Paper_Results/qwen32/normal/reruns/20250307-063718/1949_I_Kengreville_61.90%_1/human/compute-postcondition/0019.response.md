The code snippet provided changes the value of `dx` to `x[i] - x[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Given that `j` is 2, `dx` will now be the difference between `x[i]` and `x[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[2]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])`**
