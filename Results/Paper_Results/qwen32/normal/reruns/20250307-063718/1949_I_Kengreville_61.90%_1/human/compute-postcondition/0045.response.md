The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `c1` will be updated to `c1 + coef1[1]`. The initial value of `c1` is 0, so the new value of `c1` will be `coef1[1]`.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1]`, `c1` is `coef1[1]`, `j` is 1**.
