Postcondition: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`. `visited[j]` is False, and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2` equals `dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`.**
