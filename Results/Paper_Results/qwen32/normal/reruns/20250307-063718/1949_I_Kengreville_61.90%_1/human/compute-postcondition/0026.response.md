Postcondition: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited` is updated to have `True` for disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk `i`, `nodes` includes all indices of disks in the connected component, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated with values for disks in the connected component. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks.**
