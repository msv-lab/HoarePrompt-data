Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2], `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`, `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`, `j` is 2 if `visited[1]` was `False` and is now `True`. If `visited[1]` was already `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, or `j`.**
