Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS, with `visited[i]` now set to `True`. `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers used in the DFS to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks. The current disk at index `i` has been visited (`visited[i]` is `True`).**

In simple terms, the disk at index `i` has now been marked as visited in the `visited` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
