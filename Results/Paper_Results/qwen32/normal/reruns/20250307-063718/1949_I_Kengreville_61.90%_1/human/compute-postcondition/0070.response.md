The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` updates the value of `c1` by adding `coef1[j]` to it. Given the initial state, `c1` is initially `2` and `coef1[j]` is `1` since `coef1[2]` is `1` and `j` is the next element in `nodes` after `2`, which implies `j` is `2` (assuming `nodes` is structured such that `2` is followed by `2` or the problem setup inherently means `j` is `2`).

Therefore, `c1` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

The other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef1[2]` is `1`, `nodes` is a list with at least two elements, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[next_j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `3`, `j` is the next element in `nodes` after `2`, `dfs(i)` has been called.**
