i is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS. nodes is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component. coef0 and coef1 are lists of real numbers used in the DFS to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks. n is an integer representing the total number of disks.
