Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ok` is a boolean, `c0` is `c0 + 2 * coef0[j]`, `c1` is `2 * coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element of `nodes`.**

In natural language: The value of `c1` is updated to be `2 * coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `3 * coef1[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
