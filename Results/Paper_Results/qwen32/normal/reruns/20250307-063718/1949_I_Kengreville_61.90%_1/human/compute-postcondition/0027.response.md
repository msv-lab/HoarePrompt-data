Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It also utilizes additional parameters including lists `x`, `y`, and `r` for disk coordinates and radii, a list `visited` to track visited disks, a list `nodes` to store indices of disks in the current connected component, and lists `coef0` and `coef1` for maintaining relationships between radii of connected disks. The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the i-th disk, updating the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, and populating the `nodes` list with indices of disks that are part of the same connected component. There are no explicit return values as the function modifies the `visited` and `nodes` lists in place.**
