Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search starting from a specified disk, marking disks as visited and collecting indices of disks that are part of the same connected component based on their radii and positions. It updates the `visited` list to indicate which disks have been visited and populates the `nodes` list with the indices of the disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.**
