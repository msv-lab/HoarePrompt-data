### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires determining whether the radii of disks can be adjusted such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

#### Program Analysis:

**Global Variables:**
The program uses global variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. While this is not ideal practice, it doesn't inherently make the program incorrect. However, it can lead to bugs if not managed properly, especially in larger programs.

**DFS Implementation:**
The DFS function is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. The idea is to use the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to determine if the radii can be adjusted. The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` correctly checks if two disks are tangent.

**Logic for Adjusting Radii:**
The program does not explicitly adjust the radii but checks if it is possible to do so. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency. The key part is the line `ok = ok or c1 != 0`, which indicates that if `c1` is non-zero for any connected component, it is possible to adjust the radii.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
The program handles multiple disks and their tangency correctly, as demonstrated by the DFS traversal. The logic for checking tangency and maintaining the sum of radii is sound.

**Example Verification:**
Let's verify the example given in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```

**Analysis:**
- Disks are tangent in a line.
- The program will perform DFS and find a connected component where `c1` will be non-zero, indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii.

**Output:**
The program should output `YES`, which is correct.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to several issues, including:
1. Global variables.
2. Incorrect DFS logic.
3. Incorrect tangency condition.
4. Missing logic to adjust radii.
5. Handling edge cases.

However, the tangency condition is correctly implemented, and the DFS logic is sound. The program does not need to explicitly adjust the radii but only check if it is possible, which it does correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements. The original assessment contains some inaccuracies.

**Final:** **True**
