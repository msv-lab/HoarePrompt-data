The code snippet provided sets the variable `c0` to `0`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`; `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef1[2]` is `1`; `nodes` is an empty list; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `0`; `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 2; `dfs(i)` has been called.**
