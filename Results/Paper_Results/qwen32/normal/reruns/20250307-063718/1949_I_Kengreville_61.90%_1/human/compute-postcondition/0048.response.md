The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` modifies the value of `c1` by adding the value of `coef1[j]` to it. Given that `j` is 2, `c1` is updated to `c1 + coef1[2]`. 

The initial state provided includes:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`
- `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`
- `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]
- `ok` is `True`
- `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`
- `c1` is `coef1[1]`
- `j` is 2

The only variable that changes is `c1`, which is now `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`; `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 2**
