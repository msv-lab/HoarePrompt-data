Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `c1` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
