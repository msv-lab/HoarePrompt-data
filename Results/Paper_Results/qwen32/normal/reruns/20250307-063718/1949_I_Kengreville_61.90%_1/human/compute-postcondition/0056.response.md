The given code snippet assigns the value `0` to `coef0[i]`. Given that `i` is `2`, this means `coef0[2]` is set to `0`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `n` must be greater than 2 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `x` is a list of integers of length `n` (unchanged)
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n` (unchanged)
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n` (unchanged)
- `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True` (unchanged)
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`. `coef0[2]` is now `0` (changed)
- `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2] (unchanged)
- `ok` is `True` (unchanged)
- `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`. Since `coef0[2]` is now `0`, `c0` is now `coef0[1]` (changed)
- `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]` (unchanged)
- `j` is 2 (unchanged)

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`; `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `coef0[1]`; `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 2**.
