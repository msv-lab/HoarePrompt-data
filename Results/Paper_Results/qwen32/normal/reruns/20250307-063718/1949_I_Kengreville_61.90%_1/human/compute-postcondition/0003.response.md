The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The state of `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` does not directly affect whether the loop can start executing; it affects what happens inside the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
