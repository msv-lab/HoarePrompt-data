The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the variable `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is 2 and `coef1[2]` is 1, `c1` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef1[2]` is `1`, `nodes` is a list with at least one element, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, `j` is 2, `dfs(i)` has been called**.
