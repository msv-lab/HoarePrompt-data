The given code snippet modifies the value of `coef1[i]` to `1`. Given that `i` is `2`, `coef1[2]` will be set to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef0[2]` is `0`; `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where `coef1[2]` is `1`; `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `coef0[1]`; `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 2**
