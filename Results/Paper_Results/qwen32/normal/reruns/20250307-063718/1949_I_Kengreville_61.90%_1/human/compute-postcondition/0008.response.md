The code snippet assigns the value of `-coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. This means the value of `coef1[j]` is updated based on the current value of `coef1[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`. `visited[j]` is False, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**
