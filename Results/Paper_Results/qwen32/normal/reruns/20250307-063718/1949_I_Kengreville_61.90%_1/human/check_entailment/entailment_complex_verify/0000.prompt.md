You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of disks `n` and their respective centers and radii, then performs a series of operations to determine if there is at least one connected component of disks where the sum of coefficients `c1` is non-zero. It prints 'YES' if such a component exists, otherwise 'NO'.

    #State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited` is updated to have `True` for disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk `i`, `nodes` includes all indices of disks in the connected component, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated with values for disks in the connected component. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search starting from a specified disk, marking disks as visited and collecting indices of disks that are part of the same connected component based on their radii and positions. It updates the `visited` list to indicate which disks have been visited and populates the `nodes` list with the indices of the disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `dfs` use global variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. This is not a good practice and can lead to bugs, especially if the functions are called multiple times or if there are other parts of the program that use the same variable names.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is supposed to explore the graph of tangent disks and calculate the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to determine if the radii can be adjusted. However, the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented. The program does not ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while keeping the disks tangent.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Tangency**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent, but it does not account for the possibility of disks being tangent from the outside or the inside. The correct condition should check if the distance between the centers is equal to the sum or the absolute difference of the radii.

4. **Adjusting Radii**: The program does not actually adjust the radii of the disks. It only checks if it is possible to adjust the radii, but the logic for adjusting them is missing.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when there is only one disk or when all disks are tangent to each other in a complex configuration.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```

In this case, the disks are tangent to each other in a line. The program should return "YES" because we can adjust the radii to make them smaller while keeping them tangent. However, the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements for all possible cases.
