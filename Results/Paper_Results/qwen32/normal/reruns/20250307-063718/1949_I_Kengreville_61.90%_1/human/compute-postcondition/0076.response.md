The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a variety of variables and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and independent of the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, or `ok`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
