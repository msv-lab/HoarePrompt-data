Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS, with `visited[i]` now set to `True`. `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes `i`. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers used in the DFS to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks. The current disk at index `i` has been visited (`visited[i]` is `True`).
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`. If `visited[j]` is False and the sum of the squares of `r[i]` and `r[j]` equals the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`, then `visited[j]` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dx` is `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
