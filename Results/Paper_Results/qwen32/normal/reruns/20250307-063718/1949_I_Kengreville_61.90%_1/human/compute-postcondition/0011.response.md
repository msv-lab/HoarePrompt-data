The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of boolean values, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`**
