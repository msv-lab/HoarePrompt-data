### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to adjust the radii of disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of the radii strictly decreases.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph formed by disks that are tangent to each other. The key idea is to check if there exists a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

#### Key Points:
1. **Graph Representation**: The disks that are tangent to each other are treated as nodes in a graph, and the tangency condition is represented as an edge.
2. **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function is used to explore connected components of the graph. For each connected component, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) that help in determining the feasibility of adjusting the radii.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients are calculated based on the tangency condition, which is checked using the equation `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. If the disks are tangent, the coefficients are updated accordingly.
4. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of `coef1` values for each connected component is checked. If the sum is non-zero, it implies that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions.

#### Function Summary:
The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search starting from a specified disk, marking disks as visited and collecting indices of disks that are part of the same connected component based on their radii and positions. It updates the `visited` list to indicate which disks have been visited and populates the `nodes` list with the indices of the disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used globally in the `dfs` function. This can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or in different contexts.
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined but not properly integrated within `func_1`. The `n` variable is not defined within the scope of `dfs`.
3. **Logic for Feasibility**: The logic for determining feasibility based on the sum of `coef1` values is not clearly explained in the comments. The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii, but the reasoning behind this is not clear.

#### Correctness:
The program has significant issues that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness:
- **Global Variables**: Using global variables can lead to unintended side effects, especially in a recursive function like `dfs`.
- **Scope of `n`**: The variable `n` is not defined within the scope of `dfs`, leading to a `NameError`.
- **Feasibility Logic**: The logic for determining feasibility based on the sum of `coef1` values is not well-explained and may not be correct.

#### Revised Analysis:
Given the issues mentioned, the program is not guaranteed to be correct. The use of global variables and the unclear logic for determining feasibility are major concerns.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness.

Final: **False**
