### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if it is possible to change the radii of disks such that disks that were tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The solution involves checking if there is a way to assign new radii to the disks that satisfy these conditions.

The provided program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. For each connected component, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) that represent a system of linear equations. The goal is to find a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, which translates to finding a solution to the system of equations where the sum of the adjusted radii is less than the original sum.

Here are the key points from the program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes lists to store the coordinates (`x`, `y`), radii (`r`), and visited status (`visited`) of the disks. It also initializes `coef0` and `coef1` for maintaining the relationships between the radii of tangent disks.
2. **DFS Traversal**: For each unvisited disk, the program performs a DFS to explore all disks that are tangent to it. During the DFS, it updates the coefficients to reflect the relationships between the radii of the disks in the same connected component.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: After the DFS traversal for a connected component, the program checks if the sum of the coefficients (`c1`) is non-zero. If it is, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii as required. It checks the tangency conditions and uses DFS to explore connected components, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions, and ensuring that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
