The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` increments the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `coef0[j]` is `coef0[1]`. Therefore, `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[1]`.

Since `c0` was initially `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`, after the operation, `c0` becomes `coef0[1] + coef0[2] + coef0[1]`, which simplifies to `2 * coef0[1] + coef0[2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `y` is a list of integers of length `n`; `r` is a list of integers of length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`; `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `ok` is `True`; `c0` is `2 * coef0[1] + coef0[2]`; `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`; `j` is 1**.
