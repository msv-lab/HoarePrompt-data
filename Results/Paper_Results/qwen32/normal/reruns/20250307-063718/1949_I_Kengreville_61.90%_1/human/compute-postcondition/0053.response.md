The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the current value of `ok` and whether `c1` is not equal to 0. Given that `ok` is initially `True`, the expression `ok or c1 != 0` will always evaluate to `True` regardless of the value of `c1`. Therefore, `ok` remains `True`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers [1, 2], `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[2]`, `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[2]`, `j` is 2.**
