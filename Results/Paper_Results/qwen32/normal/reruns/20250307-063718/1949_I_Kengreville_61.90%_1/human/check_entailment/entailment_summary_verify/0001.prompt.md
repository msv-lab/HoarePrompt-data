You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search starting from a specified disk, marking disks as visited and collecting indices of disks that are part of the same connected component based on their radii and positions. It updates the `visited` list to indicate which disks have been visited and populates the `nodes` list with the indices of the disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to adjust the radii of disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of the radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph formed by disks that are tangent to each other. The key idea is to check if there exists a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

### Key Points:
1. **Graph Representation**: The disks that are tangent to each other are treated as nodes in a graph, and the tangency condition is represented as an edge.
2. **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function is used to explore connected components of the graph. For each connected component, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) that help in determining the feasibility of adjusting the radii.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients are calculated based on the tangency condition, which is checked using the equation `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. If the disks are tangent, the coefficients are updated accordingly.
4. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of `coef1` values for each connected component is checked. If the sum is non-zero, it implies that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used globally in the `dfs` function. This can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or in different contexts.
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined but not properly integrated within `func_1`. The `n` variable is not defined within the scope of `dfs`.
3. **Logic for Feasibility**: The logic for determining feasibility based on the sum of `coef1` values is not clearly explained in the comments. The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii, but the reasoning behind this is not clear.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, particularly the use of global variables and the unclear logic for feasibility, the program is not guaranteed to be correct. The program may not handle all edge cases correctly, and the logic for determining feasibility needs to be clarified and verified.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has significant issues that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness. The use of global variables and the unclear logic for determining feasibility are major concerns.
