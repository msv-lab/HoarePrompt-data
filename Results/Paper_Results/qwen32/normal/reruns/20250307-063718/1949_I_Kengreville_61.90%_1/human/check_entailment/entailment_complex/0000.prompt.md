Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, it means at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in a non-zero `c1`; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of disks `n` and their respective centers and radii, then performs a series of operations to determine if there is at least one connected component of disks where the sum of coefficients `c1` is non-zero. It prints 'YES' if such a component exists, otherwise 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS. nodes is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component. coef0 and coef1 are lists of real numbers used in the DFS to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks. n is an integer representing the total number of disks.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

        #State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers. `visited` is a list of boolean values with `True` for disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk `i`. `nodes` is a list that includes all indices of disks in the connected component. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of real numbers with updated values for disks in the connected component. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks.
    #State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited` is updated to have `True` for disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk `i`, `nodes` includes all indices of disks in the connected component, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated with values for disks in the connected component. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. `n` is an integer representing the total number of disks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search starting from a specified disk, marking disks as visited and collecting indices of disks that are part of the same connected component based on their radii and positions. It updates the `visited` list to indicate which disks have been visited and populates the `nodes` list with the indices of the disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to maintain relationships between the radii of connected disks.
