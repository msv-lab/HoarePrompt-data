Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Global Variables:** The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, and `n` are used in the `dfs` function without being declared as global, which will cause a `NameError` in Python.

2. **DFS Logic:** The DFS function is supposed to traverse the graph of tangent disks and determine if it is possible to adjust the radii. However, the way the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) are calculated and used does not correctly represent the problem constraints. The coefficients are intended to help determine if the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining tangency, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

3. **Condition for "YES":** The condition `c1 != 0` is not sufficient to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required. The program needs to ensure that the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the sum of the original radii while maintaining tangency.

4. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if there is only one disk, the answer should be "NO" because the radius cannot be decreased while maintaining tangency (since there are no other disks).

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to analyze the graph of disks and their tangencies more carefully. A possible approach is to use a system of linear equations to determine if there exists a set of new radii that satisfy the conditions. This would involve setting up equations based on the tangency constraints and solving them to check if a valid solution exists.
