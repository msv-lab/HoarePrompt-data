The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the current value of `ok` and the condition `c1 != 0`. 

If `ok` is already `True`, it remains `True` regardless of the value of `c1`. If `ok` is `False`, it will become `True` only if `c1` is not equal to `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x`, `y`, `r` are lists of integers of length `n`
- `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`
- `nodes` is a list of integers
- `ok` is a boolean
- `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`
- `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`

The only variable that changes is `ok`. The new value of `ok` depends on its previous value and whether `c1` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list of integers, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `c1` was not equal to `0`, `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.**
