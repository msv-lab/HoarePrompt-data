Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is `coef0[1]`, `c1` is 0, `j` is 1**

In natural language: The value of `c0` is now equal to `coef0[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
