Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for i in range(n); `m` is the minimum value in the original list `a`; `ans` is `a[0]`; `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is now set to the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain as they were defined in the initial state.
