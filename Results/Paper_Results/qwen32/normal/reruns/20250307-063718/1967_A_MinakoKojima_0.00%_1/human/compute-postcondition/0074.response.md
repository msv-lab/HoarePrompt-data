To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables over time.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` and adjusts `k` accordingly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99.
   - `n` and `k` are new integers obtained from the input.
   - `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input.
   - `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration `i` in the range `n`:
     - `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - `k` is decremented by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

After `n` iterations, the loop will have processed all elements of the list `a`. Here's the state after all iterations:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop's range and not modified within the loop.
- `k` is reduced by the cumulative sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list where each element has been updated based on the formula `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` as calculated initially and not modified within the loop.
- `ans` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes its last iteration, but this value is not relevant after the loop ends.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` and `k` are the new integers obtained from the input, with `k` now being reduced by the cumulative sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `a` is the new list of integers with each element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains the same, `k` is reduced based on the loop's operations, `a` is updated with new values, `m` remains the minimum value of the initial list `a`, and `ans` stays 0.
