To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior step-by-step.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it performs the following operations:
1. Updates `a[i]` to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
2. Decreases `k` by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute `n` times as long as `n` is greater than 0.

By the end of all iterations:
- `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `a` will have been updated `n` times according to the formula `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `k` will have been decremented by the sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `m` will be the minimum value in the list `a` after all updates.
- `t` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the number of iterations which is greater than 0; `k` is the remaining value after all the decrements; `a` is a list of integers updated `n` times; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `t` and `ans` remain the same, `k` is reduced by the total amount calculated during the loop, `a` is updated `n` times based on the given formula, `m` is recalculated as the minimum value in the updated `a`, and the loop index `i` equals `n`.
