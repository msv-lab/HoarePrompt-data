Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - n * m - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `a` is the new list of integers with the last element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.**

Natural language: The value of `a[i]` has been updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, and `i`.
