To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions and calculations described in the initial state.

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 99\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is calculated based on the following conditions:
     - If \(k \geq n \times m\), then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)` and `i` is `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is the product \(a[0] \times (a[1] - a[0]) \times (a[2] - a[1]) \times \ldots \times (a[n-1] - a[n-2])\), and `i` is `n`.

2. **Determine `ans`:**
   - First, we need to know the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` to determine `m`.
   - Then, we can check if \(k \geq n \times m\).
     - If true, `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
     - If false, `ans` is the product of the differences as described.

Since the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the conditions given.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If \(k \geq n \times m\):
  - `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`.
- Otherwise:
  - `ans` is the product \(a[0] \times (a[1] - a[0]) \times (a[2] - a[1]) \times \ldots \times (a[n-1] - a[n-2])\).

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is math.factorial(n) if k >= n * m, otherwise ans is the product a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]))**
