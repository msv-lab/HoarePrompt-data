Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for i in range(n); `m` is the minimum value in the original list `a`; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to `ans` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The other variables remain as they were described in the initial state.
