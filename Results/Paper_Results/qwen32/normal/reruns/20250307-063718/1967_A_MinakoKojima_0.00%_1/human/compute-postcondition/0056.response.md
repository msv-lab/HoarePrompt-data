To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions that define the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable does not directly affect the value of `ans` and is likely used in a loop or context not provided here.
2. **`n`**: An integer obtained from the input. This represents the number of elements in list `a`.
3. **`k`**: An integer obtained from the input. This value is used in a condition to determine the value of `ans`.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers with `n` elements, obtained from the input.
5. **`m`**: The minimum value in the list `a`.
6. **`ans`**: This variable is determined by the following condition:
   - If \(k \geq n \times m\), then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is the product \(a[0] \times (a[1] - a[0]) \times (a[2] - a[1]) \times \ldots \times (a[n-1] - a[n-2])\).

### Determining the Value of `ans`
- **Case 1: \(k \geq n \times m\)**:
  - In this case, `ans` is calculated as the factorial of `n`. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
  - Example: If `n` is 5, then `ans` would be \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

- **Case 2: \(k < n \times m\)**:
  - In this case, `ans` is calculated as the product of the first element of `a` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
  - Example: If `a` is \([2, 5, 9]\), then `ans` would be \(2 \times (5 - 2) \times (9 - 5) = 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\).

### Conclusion
The value of `ans` depends on the condition involving `k` and `n * m`. If the condition \(k \geq n \times m\) is true, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product described above.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the precise value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `k`, and `a`. However, we can describe the output based on these conditions.

### Final Output
Output: **ans (where ans is math.factorial(n) if k >= n * m, otherwise ans is the product a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]))**
