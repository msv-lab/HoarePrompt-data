The given code snippet multiplies the variable `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` and `a` are as defined, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`.**

In natural language, the output state means that `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `n` is still at least 2, `i` remains 2, `k` and `a` retain their definitions, `m` is still the minimum value in the list `a`, and `ans` is now the product of its previous value and the difference between the third and second elements of `a`.
