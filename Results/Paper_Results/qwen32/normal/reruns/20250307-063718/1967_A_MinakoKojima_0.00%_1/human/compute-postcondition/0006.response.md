The code snippet calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`; `k` is greater than or equal to `n` multiplied by `m`.**
