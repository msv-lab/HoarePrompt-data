Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` and `k` are the new integers obtained from the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)` and `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `n` is at least 2, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is `n`.**
