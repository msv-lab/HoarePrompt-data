Let's break down the provided code snippet and determine the new state of the variables based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `k` is `k - n * m`
- `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`

The code snippet is:
```python
a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
```

The value of `a[i]` is updated based on the expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

Let's analyze the expression:
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `k` is `k - n * m`.
- `a[i]` is the `i`-th element of the list `a`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a`.

The new value of `a[i]` will be `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

To determine the new value of `a[i]`, we need to consider the possible values of `k` and the current value of `a[i]`. However, since the exact values of `k` and `a[i]` are not provided, we can describe the transformation in terms of the expression.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `k` remains `k - n * m`
- `a` is the list of integers with the last element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`
- `m` remains the minimum value in the list `a` (Note: The value of `m` might change if the new value of `a[i]` is less than `m`, but we do not have enough information to determine this.)
- `ans` remains 0
- `i` remains `n-1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - n * m`; `a` is the new list of integers with the last element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is `n-1`.**
