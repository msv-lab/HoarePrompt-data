The code snippet multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the difference calculated will be `a[1] - a[0]`. The value of `ans` is initially `a[0]`, so after the operation, `ans` becomes `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` and `a` are as defined, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`**.
