Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)` and `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])` and `i` is `n-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
