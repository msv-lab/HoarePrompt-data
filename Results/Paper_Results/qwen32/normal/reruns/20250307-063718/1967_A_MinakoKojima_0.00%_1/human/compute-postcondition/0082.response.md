Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `k` and `a` are as defined, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will be the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m`) will remain in their defined states as per the initial conditions and updates within the loop.
