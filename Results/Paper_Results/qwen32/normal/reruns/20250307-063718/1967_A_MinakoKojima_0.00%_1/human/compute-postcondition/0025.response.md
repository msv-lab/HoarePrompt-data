The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, this means `ans` will be updated by multiplying it with `a[2] - a[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the number of iterations which must be greater than 1; `k` is the remaining value after all the decrements; `a` is a list of integers updated `n` times; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is `a[0] * (a[0] - a[-1]) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`; `i` is 2.**
