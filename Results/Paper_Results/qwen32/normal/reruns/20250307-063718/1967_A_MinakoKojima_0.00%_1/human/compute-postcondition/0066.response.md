Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - n * m - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `a` is the new list of integers with the last element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
