Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.**

Natural language: The variable `m` is now assigned the minimum value from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
