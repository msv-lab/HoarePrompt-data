Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
