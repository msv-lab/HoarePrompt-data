Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` and `k` are the new integers obtained from the input, with `k` now being reduced by the cumulative sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `a` is the new list of integers with each element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is `a[0]`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated to hold the value of the first element of the list `a`. All other variables retain their values as described in the initial state.
