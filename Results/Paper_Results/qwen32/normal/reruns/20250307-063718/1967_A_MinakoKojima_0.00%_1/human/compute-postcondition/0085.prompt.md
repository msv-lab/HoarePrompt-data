Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers, which may have been updated `n` times in the else part; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` multiplied by `m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)` and `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])` and `i` is `n-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` and `k` are the new integers obtained from the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)` and `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `n` is at least 2, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
