The code snippet sets `ans` to 0, overriding its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 99; `n` and `k` are the new integers obtained from the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1`.**
