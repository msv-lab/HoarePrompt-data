The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of those string values to an integer, and then stores the list of these integers in the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
