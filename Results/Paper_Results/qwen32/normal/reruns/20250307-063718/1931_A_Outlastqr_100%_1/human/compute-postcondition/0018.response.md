The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable. The loop will execute based on the value of `i` and the input value provided to `range(int(input()))`. Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to adjust the state of `i` for the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the input value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that the state of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `word` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1**
