The code snippet concatenates the string `'aa'` with the character from the `alphabet` string at the position `n - 3` to the `word` variable. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than 27, and `alphabet` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, the character at position `n - 3` will be the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet.

For example, if `n` is 4, the character at position `4 - 3 = 1` in `alphabet` is `'b'`. Thus, `word` will become `'aab'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than 27, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`, and `n` is not equal to 27.**
