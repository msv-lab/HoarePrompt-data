Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, and `word` is set based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If `n` > 27 but `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + the character at index `n - 28` in `alphabet` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.**
