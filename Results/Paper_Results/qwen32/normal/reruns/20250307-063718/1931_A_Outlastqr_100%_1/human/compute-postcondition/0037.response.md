Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, and `word` is set to 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` > 27. If `n` is 27, `word` is set to 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is set to 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**
