The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `word` with an empty string. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `alphabet`, `i`) are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `word` is now an empty string, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is an empty string.**
