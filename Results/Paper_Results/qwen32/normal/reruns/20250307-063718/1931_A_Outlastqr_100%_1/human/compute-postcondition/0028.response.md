To determine the output of the `print(word)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the conditions and how `word` is constructed based on the value of `n`.

The conditions for constructing `word` are as follows:
1. If `n > 52`, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n > 27` and `n <= 52`, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
3. If `n` equals 27, `word` is 'aay'.
4. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.

Since the value of `n` is not explicitly provided, we need to consider each possible range of `n` and the corresponding `word` construction.

Let's break it down:
- **For `n > 52`:**
  - `word` is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - For example, if `n = 53`, `word` would be `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` which is `'a' + 'zz'` resulting in `'azz'`.
  - If `n = 78`, `word` would be `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` which is `'z' + 'zz'` resulting in `'zzz'`.

- **For `n > 27` and `n <= 52`:**
  - `word` is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
  - For example, if `n = 28`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'a' + 'z'` resulting in `'aaz'`.
  - If `n = 52`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[24] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'y' + 'z'` resulting in `'ayz'`.

- **For `n = 27`:**
  - `word` is `'aay'`.

- **For `n <= 26`:**
  - `word` is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
  - For example, if `n = 1`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[-2]` which is out of bounds, so this case is invalid since `n` must be at least 3.
  - If `n = 3`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[0]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` resulting in `'aaa'`.
  - If `n = 26`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[23]` which is `'aa' + 'x'` resulting in `'aax'`.

Given that `n` is an input integer and its exact value is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is constructed based on the value of n as per the given conditions)**

To be more precise:
- If `n > 52`, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n > 27` and `n <= 52`, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If `n = 27`, `word` is `'aay'`.
- If `n <= 26`, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we describe `word` in terms of these conditions.

Output: **word (where word is constructed based on the value of n: alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz' if n > 52, 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z' if 27 < n <= 52, 'aay' if n = 27, 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3] if n <= 26)**
