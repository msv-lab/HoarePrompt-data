Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` equals 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.**
