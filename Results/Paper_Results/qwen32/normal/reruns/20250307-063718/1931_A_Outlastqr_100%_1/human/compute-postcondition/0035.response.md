The code snippet concatenates the string 'aa' with the character from the `alphabet` string at the index `n - 3` and assigns it to the `word` variable. The `t` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `n` variable also remains unchanged. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged. The `i` variable is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is mentioned in the Initial State and not affected by the code snippet, it is not changed in this context. The `word` variable, which was initially an empty string, now holds the new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`**
