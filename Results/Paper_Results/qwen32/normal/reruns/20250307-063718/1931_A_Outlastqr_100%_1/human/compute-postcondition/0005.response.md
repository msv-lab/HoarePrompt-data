The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` modifies the `word` variable by appending a character from `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a non-negative integer less than 26 (since `n` can be at most 100, making `n - 53` at most 47, which is within the bounds of the `alphabet` string).

Let's break down the changes:
- `alphabet[n - 53]` will select a character from the `alphabet` string. For example, if `n` is 53, `alphabet[n - 53]` is `alphabet[0]` which is 'a'. If `n` is 54, `alphabet[n - 53]` is `alphabet[1]` which is 'b', and so on.
- The selected character is then concatenated with 'zz' and added to the `word` variable.

Since `word` was initially an empty string, after the execution of the code, `word` will be the selected character followed by 'zz'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 52, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
