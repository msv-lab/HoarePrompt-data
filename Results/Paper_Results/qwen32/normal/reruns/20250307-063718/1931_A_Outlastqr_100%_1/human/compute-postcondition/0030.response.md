The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the user input. The other variables (`t`, `alphabet`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Since `n` is now assigned a new value from the input, we need to reflect this in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
