The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `alphabet`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1.**
