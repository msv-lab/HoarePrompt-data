Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is constructed using lowercase English letters and follows specific rules depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to 27, between 28 and 52, or greater than 52.**
