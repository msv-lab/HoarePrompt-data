Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly handles all possible values of `n` within the specified range and outputs the lexicographically smallest word for each case.

The program uses a straightforward approach:
- If `n > 52`, it outputs a word starting with the letter corresponding to `n - 53` and ending with 'zz'.
- If `28 <= n <= 52`, it outputs a word starting with 'a', followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28`, and ending with 'z'.
- If `n == 27`, it outputs 'aay'.
- If `3 <= n <= 26`, it outputs a word starting with 'aa' and ending with the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. For `n = 24`:
   - The program outputs 'aav'.
   - This is correct because 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) + 'v' (22) = 24, and 'aav' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 24.

2. For `n = 70`:
   - The program outputs 'rzz'.
   - This is correct because 'r' (18) + 'z' (26) + 'z' (26) = 70, and 'rzz' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 70.

3. For `n = 3`:
   - The program outputs 'aaa'.
   - This is correct because 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) = 3, and 'aaa' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 3.

4. For `n = 55`:
   - The program outputs 'czz'.
   - This is correct because 'c' (3) + 'z' (26) + 'z' (26) = 55, and 'czz' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 55.

5. For `n = 48`:
   - The program outputs 'auz'.
   - This is correct because 'a' (1) + 'u' (21) + 'z' (26) = 48, and 'auz' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 48.

The program correctly handles all given test cases and the logic appears to be sound for all values of `n` in the range 3 to 78.

Correctness: **True**
