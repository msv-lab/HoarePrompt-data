### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the smallest 3-letter word based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - For example, if the sum is 24, the smallest word is "aav" because it is lexicographically smaller than "ava".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` to create a string of all lowercase letters.
   - It processes each test case by reading an integer `n` which represents the encoded sum.
   - Based on the value of `n`, it constructs a 3-letter word:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - If `n > 27`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - If `n == 27`, it constructs the word as `'aay'`.
     - If `n <= 27`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

3. **Verifying the Logic**:
   - **Case `n > 52`**:
     - The sum `n` can be as large as 78 (since `3*26 = 78`).
     - For `n > 52`, the code assigns the first letter as `alphabet[n - 53]`, which is valid because `n - 53` ranges from 0 to 25 (inclusive).
     - The remaining letters are `'zz'`, which is the largest possible letters, ensuring the word is the smallest lexicographically for this range.
   - **Case `n > 27`**:
     - For `n > 27`, the code assigns the first letter as `'a'` and the second letter as `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - The third letter is `'z'`, which is the largest possible letter, ensuring the word is the smallest lexicographically for this range.
   - **Case `n == 27`**:
     - For `n == 27`, the code assigns the word as `'aay'`.
     - This is the smallest possible word for this sum because `'aay'` is lexicographically smaller than any other combination that sums to 27.
   - **Case `n <= 27`**:
     - For `n <= 27`, the code assigns the first two letters as `'aa'` and the third letter as `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This ensures the word is the smallest lexicographically for this range.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly handles all possible cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word based on the given encoded sum.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
