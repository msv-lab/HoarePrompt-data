The provided Python code snippet initializes a variable `alphabet` with the value of `string.ascii_lowercase`, which contains all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The variables `t` and `n` from the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, and `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
