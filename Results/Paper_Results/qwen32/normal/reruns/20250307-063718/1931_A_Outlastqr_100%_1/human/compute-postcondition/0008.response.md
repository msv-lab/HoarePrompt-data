Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'**

In simple terms, the value of `word` is now a string that starts with 'a', followed by the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.
