Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 52, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` is greater than 27, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 27, `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**
