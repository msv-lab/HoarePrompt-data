The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` modifies the `word` variable by appending a substring to it. The substring consists of a character from the `alphabet` string at the index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. 

Given that `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character at index `n - 53` can be determined if we know the value of `n`. However, since `n` is only described as an input integer without a specific value, we can express the new value of `word` in terms of `n`.

The new value of `word` is the original empty string plus the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` plus 'zz'. Therefore, the new `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `alphabet`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
