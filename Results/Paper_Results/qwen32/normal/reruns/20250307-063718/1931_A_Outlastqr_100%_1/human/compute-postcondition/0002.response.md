The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the input. The initial conditions for `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, as per the input requirement. However, since the input value is not specified, we can only confirm it is an integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
