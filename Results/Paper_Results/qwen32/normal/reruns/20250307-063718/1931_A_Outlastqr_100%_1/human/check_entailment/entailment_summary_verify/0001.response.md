Let's carefully analyze the program's logic and verify its correctness based on the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (where each letter is a lowercase Latin letter) that sums up to a given integer `n` when the letters are converted to their respective positions in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

### Program Analysis

The program uses a series of conditional statements to construct the word based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n > 52`**:
   - The word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This logic assumes that the smallest word for `n > 52` will have the form `[letter]zz`. 
   - For example, if `n = 54`, the word should be 'bzz' (2 + 26 + 26 = 54). The program correctly identifies this.

2. **If `n > 27` and `n <= 52`**:
   - The word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This logic assumes that the smallest word for `n` in this range will have the form `a[letter]z`.
   - For example, if `n = 53`, the word should be 'azz' (1 + 26 + 26 = 53). The program correctly identifies this.

3. **If `n == 27`**:
   - The word is directly assigned as `'aay'`.
   - This is because 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27) is the only word that sums to 27.

4. **If `n <= 26`**:
   - The word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This logic assumes that the smallest word for `n` in this range will have the form `aa[letter]`.
   - For example, if `n = 3`, the word should be 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3). The program correctly identifies this.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program's output against the provided test cases:

1. **For `n = 24`**:
   - Expected output: 'aav' (1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
   - Program output: 'aav' (correct).

2. **For `n = 70`**:
   - Expected output: 'rzz' (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
   - Program output: 'rzz' (correct).

3. **For `n = 3`**:
   - Expected output: 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
   - Program output: 'aaa' (correct).

4. **For `n = 55`**:
   - Expected output: 'czz' (3 + 26 + 26 = 55).
   - Program output: 'czz' (correct).

5. **For `n = 48`**:
   - Expected output: 'auz' (1 + 21 + 26 = 48).
   - Program output: 'auz' (correct).

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the logic needed to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to the given integer `n`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
