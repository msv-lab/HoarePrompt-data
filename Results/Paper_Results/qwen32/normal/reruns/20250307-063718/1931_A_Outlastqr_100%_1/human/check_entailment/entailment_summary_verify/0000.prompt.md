You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is constructed using lowercase English letters and follows specific rules depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to 27, between 28 and 52, or greater than 52.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded given the sum of the positions of all the characters in the alphabet.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded as `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic to determine the word:
- For `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- For `28 ≤ n ≤ 52`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- For `n == 27`, it constructs the word as `'aay'`.
- For `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Checking the Logic:
Let's verify the logic against the problem description:

1. **For `n > 52`**:
   - The formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` ensures that the first letter is selected based on the value of `n`, and the remaining two letters are 'z'. This is correct because the smallest possible sum for a word starting with a letter later than 'a' and followed by two 'z's is 53 (bzz).
   
2. **For `28 ≤ n ≤ 52`**:
   - The formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` ensures that the first letter is 'a', the second letter is selected based on the value of `n`, and the third letter is 'z'. This is correct because the smallest possible sum for a word starting with 'a' and ending with 'z' is 28 (aay).

3. **For `n == 27`**:
   - The formula `'aay'` is correct because the smallest possible sum for a word starting with 'a' and ending with 'y' is 27 (aay).

4. **For `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`**:
   - The formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` ensures that the first two letters are 'a' and the third letter is selected based on the value of `n`. This is correct because the smallest possible sum for a word starting with two 'a's is 3 (aaa).

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with some edge cases to ensure it works correctly:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3` → Output: `'aaa'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 26` → Output: `'aaz'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 27` → Output: `'aay'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 28` → Output: `'abay'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 52` → Output: `'aayz'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 6**: `n = 53` → Output: `'bzz'` (Correct)
- **Test Case 7**: `n = 78` → Output: `'zzz'` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**.
