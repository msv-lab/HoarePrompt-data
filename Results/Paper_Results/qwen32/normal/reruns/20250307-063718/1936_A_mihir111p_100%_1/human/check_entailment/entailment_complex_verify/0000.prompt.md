You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is the length of the secret permutation p. The function func_1 is used to make a query by providing these indices to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in the permutation.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)
    return input()
    #The program returns the value provided by the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. It prints a query comparing the bitwise OR of the pairs `(p[a], p[b])` and `(p[c], p[d])`. The function returns the value provided by the user input in response to this query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The program uses a flawed strategy to determine the maximum XOR value, and there are potential cases where it will fail to find the correct pair.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Identification of Maximum OR Values**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum OR value by comparing pairs of elements. However, the maximum OR value does not necessarily correspond to the maximum XOR value. The OR operation and XOR operation are different bitwise operations, and the maximum OR value does not guarantee the maximum XOR value.
   - For example, consider the permutation \([0, 3, 1, 2]\). The maximum OR value is 3, which can be obtained from pairs \((0, 3)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 3)\), \((1, 2)\), etc. However, the maximum XOR value is 3, which can be obtained from pairs \((3, 0)\) and \((3, 1)\). The program may incorrectly identify one of the indices with the maximum OR value as the index with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Equal OR Values**:
   - The program collects all indices that have the same maximum OR value and then tries to find the maximum XOR value among these indices. However, this approach is not guaranteed to work because the maximum XOR value can be between any two indices, not necessarily between indices that have the same maximum OR value.
   - For example, in the permutation \([0, 3, 1, 2]\), the indices with the maximum OR value (3) are \([1, 2, 3]\). The program may incorrectly compare these indices among themselves to find the maximum XOR value, but the actual maximum XOR value can be between indices 3 and 0 or 3 and 1, which are not in the list of indices with the maximum OR value.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Search**:
   - The program does not perform a comprehensive search to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It relies on the assumption that the maximum OR value will help identify the maximum XOR value, which is not always true.
   - A more robust approach would be to perform a more systematic search, such as trying different combinations of indices to find the maximum XOR value directly.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It relies on the maximum OR value, which does not guarantee the maximum XOR value, and does not perform a comprehensive search to find the correct pair of indices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
