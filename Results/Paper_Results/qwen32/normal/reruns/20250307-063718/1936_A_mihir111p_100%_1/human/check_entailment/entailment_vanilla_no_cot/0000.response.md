Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The program tries to find an index `ans1` such that the value \( p_{ans1} \) is likely to be one of the largest values in the permutation \( p \). However, the logic used is flawed. The query `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` is always comparing the same value \( p_{ans1} \) with itself, which will always result in `=`. Therefore, `ans1` will not be updated correctly.

2. **Finding `mx`:**
   - The program then tries to find an index `mx` such that the value \( p_{mx} \) is likely to be one of the largest values in the permutation \( p \). Similar to the previous step, the logic used is flawed. The query `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)` is comparing \( p_{mx} \mid p_{mx} \) with \( p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1} \), which will also always result in `=` if `mx` and `ans1` are the same. If they are different, it will not correctly identify the largest values.

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - The program then tries to find the best index `ans` from the list `v` (which is supposed to contain the largest values) such that \( p_{ans} \) is the largest. However, the query `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])` is comparing the same value with itself, which will always result in `=`. Therefore, `ans` will not be updated correctly.

The program does not correctly identify the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The strategy should involve using the provided queries to compare different pairs of values in the permutation to identify the largest values and then find the pair with the maximum XOR.

A correct approach would involve using the queries to compare different pairs of values to identify the largest values and then find the pair with the maximum XOR. The provided program does not follow this approach and thus is incorrect.
