The given Python code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs a question mark (`?`) followed by four integers (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`). According to the initial state, these integers are indices into a secret permutation `p`, and `func_1` is used to make a query by comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements at these indices in the permutation.

Here's the breakdown of the output:

- `?` is a literal character.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers that are constrained by the condition `0 <= a, b, c, d < n`, where `n` is the length of the secret permutation `p`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of the given constraints.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
