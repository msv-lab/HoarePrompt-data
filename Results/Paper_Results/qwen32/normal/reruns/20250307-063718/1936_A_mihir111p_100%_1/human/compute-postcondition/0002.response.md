Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. The function returns a value that is provided by the user input based on a query comparing the bitwise OR of the pairs `(p[a], p[b])` and `(p[c], p[d])`.**
