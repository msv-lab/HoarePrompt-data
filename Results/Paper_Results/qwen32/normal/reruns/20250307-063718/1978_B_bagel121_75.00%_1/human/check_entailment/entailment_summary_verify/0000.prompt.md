You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by selecting `n` integers where each integer is either `a` or between `a` and `b` (inclusive), with the goal of maximizing the sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

The logic used in the program is:
1. If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price of the first bun), then it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. Otherwise, calculate the optimal `k` (number of buns to sell at the modified price) as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
3. Compute the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
4. Compute the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
5. Print the total profit.

### Edge Cases and Verification

#### Case 1: `a >= b`
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Example: `n=4, a=5, b=4` → `k=0`, total profit = `4 * 5 = 20`.

#### Case 2: `a < b`
- If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)` and sells the first `k` buns at the modified price.
- The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series formula.
- The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
- Example: `n=4, a=4, b=5` → `k=2`, total profit = `(5 + 4) / 2 * 2 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 9 + 8 = 17`.

#### Case 3: Large Values
- The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints (`1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`).
- Example: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000` → `k=0`, total profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the described cases and edge cases. It calculates the maximum profit based on the given conditions and constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The program correctly handles all scenarios, including when the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, and when `a` is less than `b`. It also efficiently computes the total profit for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.
