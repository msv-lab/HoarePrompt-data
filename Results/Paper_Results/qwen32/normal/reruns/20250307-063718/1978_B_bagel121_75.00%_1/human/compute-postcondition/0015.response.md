Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**.

In simpler terms, `t` has been decremented by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values, `k` is still the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` has been calculated using the formula provided.
