Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; no further iterations of the loop will occur.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to execute. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the most recent iteration will not be changed, as they are only used within the loop body and do not persist after the loop ends.
