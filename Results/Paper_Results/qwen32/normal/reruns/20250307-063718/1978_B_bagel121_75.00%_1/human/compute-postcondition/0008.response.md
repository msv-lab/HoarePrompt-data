The code snippet calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for `p2`, which is newly calculated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
