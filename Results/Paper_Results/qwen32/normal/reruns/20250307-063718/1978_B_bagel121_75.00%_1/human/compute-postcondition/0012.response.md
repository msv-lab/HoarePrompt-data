The provided code snippet reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This will update the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the input, and the other variables will remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them. Since no further operations are provided in the snippet, we only need to reflect the changes made by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**
