The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within their respective ranges. However, the code snippet overwrites the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` with the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, but `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values provided by the input.
