The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
