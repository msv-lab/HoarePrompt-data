To determine the output of the `print(n * a)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `n` and `a` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\). This tells us that `t` is in the range from 1 to \(10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The value of `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for determining the output of the `print` statement.
- The variables `n` and `a` are explicitly mentioned in the `print` statement, and their values are read from the input.

### Analysis:
- `n * a` is the product of the integers `n` and `a`.
- Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print(n * a)` statement will output the product of `n` and `a`. Given that `n` and `a` are integers read from the input, the output will be the result of multiplying these two integers.

### Final Output:
Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
