Let's analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine if the program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it computes the maximum profit based on the number of buns `n`, the usual price `a`, and the modified price of the first bun `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a >= b`, it's more profitable to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Therefore, the total profit is `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
     - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series formula: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is `ans + p2`.

### Edge Cases and Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `n=4, a=4, b=5`
   - Calculation:
     - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
     - Profit from first 2 buns: `ans = (5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2 = (5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9`.
     - Profit from remaining 2 buns: `p2 = (4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
     - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.
   - Expected Output: `17`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `n=5, a=5, b=9`
   - Calculation:
     - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
     - Profit from first 5 buns: `ans = (9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5 = (9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 35`.
     - Profit from remaining 0 buns: `p2 = (5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
     - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.
   - Expected Output: `35`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `n=10, a=10, b=5`
   - Calculation:
     - Since `a >= b`, sell all buns at the usual price: `n * a = 10 * 10 = 100`.
   - Expected Output: `100`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - Since `a >= b`, sell all buns at the usual price: `n * a = 1000000000 * 1000000000`.
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`.
