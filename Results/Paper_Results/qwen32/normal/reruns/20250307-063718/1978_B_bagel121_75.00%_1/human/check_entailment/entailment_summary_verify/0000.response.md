Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

The logic used in the program is:
1. If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price of the first bun), then it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. Otherwise, calculate the optimal `k` (number of buns to sell at the modified price) as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
3. Compute the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
4. Compute the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
5. Print the total profit.

### Detailed Verification

#### Case 1: `a >= b`
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Example: `n=4, a=5, b=4` → `k=0`, total profit = `4 * 5 = 20`.
- This matches the expected behavior as selling at the usual price would yield higher or equal profit.

#### Case 2: `a < b`
- If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)` and sells the first `k` buns at the modified price.
- The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series formula.
- The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
- Example: `n=4, a=4, b=5` → `k=2`, total profit = `(5 + 4) / 2 * 2 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 9 + 8 = 17`.
- This matches the expected behavior as selling the first two buns at modified prices (5 and 4) and the remaining at usual prices (4 and 4) yields the maximum profit of 17.

#### Case 3: Large Values
- The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints (`1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`).
- Example: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000` → `k=0`, total profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`.
- This matches the expected behavior as selling all buns at the usual price when `a` equals `b` yields the maximum profit.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary states that the function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by selecting `n` integers where each integer is either `a` or between `a` and `b` (inclusive), with the goal of maximizing the sum.

This summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. The program does indeed calculate the maximum profit by determining the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the described cases and edge cases. It calculates the maximum profit based on the given conditions and constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.
