Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no additional changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is set to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
