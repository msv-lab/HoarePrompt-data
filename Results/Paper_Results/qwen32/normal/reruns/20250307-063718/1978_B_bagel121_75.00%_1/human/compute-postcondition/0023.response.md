The code calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. Here, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The initial conditions of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, except for the calculation of `k` and the assignment of `ans`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is then calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.

The value of `ans` will be an integer based on the above formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**.
