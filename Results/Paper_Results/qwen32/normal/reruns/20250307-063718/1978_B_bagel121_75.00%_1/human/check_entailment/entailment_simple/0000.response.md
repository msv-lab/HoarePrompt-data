### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve from selling his buns under the given promotional pricing rules. To verify the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements and the provided examples.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `a >= b`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the promotional price does not offer any benefit. Thus, the profit is `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, Bob should consider selling some buns at the promotional price to maximize profit:
     - Determine the maximum number of buns `k` that can be sold at the promotional price. This is the minimum of `b - a + 1` (the number of distinct promotional prices available) and `n` (the total number of buns).
     - Calculate the profit from selling `k` buns at the promotional prices. The promotional prices form an arithmetic sequence from `b` down to `b - k + 1`. The sum of this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
     - Calculate the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of the two calculated profits.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5)**:
     - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
     - Profit from promotional buns: \((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2 = 9\).
     - Profit from usual buns: `(4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
     - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17` (matches the expected output).
   - **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9)**:
     - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
     - Profit from promotional buns: \((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5 = 35\).
     - Profit from usual buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
     - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35` (matches the expected output).
   - **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5)**:
     - Since `a >= b`, the optimal profit is `10 * 10 = 100` (matches the expected output).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case.
