The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. However, the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the start of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9
- If `a` >= `b`, the program does not modify any additional variables.
- Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9**
