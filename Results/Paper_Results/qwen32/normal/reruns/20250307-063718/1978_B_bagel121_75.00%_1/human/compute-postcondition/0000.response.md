The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be whatever integer the user inputs, but it will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by the provided code snippet. Therefore, they retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
