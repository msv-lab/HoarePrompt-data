Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` remains `t - 1` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new variable `k` is assigned the value of the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
