You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob sells `n` buns, with two different pricing strategies:
1. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
2. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Decision Making**: If `a >= b`, it means the usual price is greater than or equal to the highest possible modified price, so it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
3. **Optimal k Calculation**: If `a < b`, it calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and does not exceed the number of different prices available (`b - a + 1`).
4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - It calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - It calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two values: `ans + p2`.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5)**:
   - Since `a < b`, `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
   - Profit from first 2 buns: `(5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9`.
   - Profit from remaining 2 buns: `(4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
   - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Since `a < b`, `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first 5 buns: `(9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 35`.
   - No remaining buns, so no additional profit.
   - Total profit: `35`.
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5)**:
   - Since `a >= b`, all buns are sold at `a`.
   - Total profit: `10 * 10 = 100`.
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Fourth Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Since `a < b`, `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first 5 buns: `(11 + 6) / 2 * 5 = 42.5 * 5 = 45`.
   - No remaining buns, so no additional profit.
   - Total profit: `45`.
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Fifth Test Case (n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000)**:
   - Since `a >= b`, all buns are sold at `a`.
   - Total profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
   - This matches the expected output.

6. **Sixth Test Case (n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1)**:
   - Since `a >= b`, all buns are sold at `a`.
   - Total profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
   - This matches the expected output.

7. **Seventh Test Case (n=1000, a=1, b=1000)**:
   - Since `a < b`, `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
   - Profit from first 1000 buns: `(1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000 = 500500`.
   - No remaining buns, so no additional profit.
   - Total profit: `500500`.
   - This matches the expected output.
