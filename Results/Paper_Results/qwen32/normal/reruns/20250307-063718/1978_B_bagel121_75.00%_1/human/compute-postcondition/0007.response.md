The code calculates the value of `ans` based on the given formula. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is determined as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The formula used to calculate `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. 

Given the initial state, `k` is calculated as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. The value of `ans` is then computed using this `k` and the formula provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**.
