### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a >= b`, it means that the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the price of the first bun `b`. In this scenario, it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling any bun at the modified price would yield less or the same profit.
   - If `a < b`, it means that the modified price could potentially yield more profit for the first `k` buns. The program calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because the modified price decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun, and the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price is `b - a + 1`. However, if `n` is less than `b - a + 1`, then only `n` buns can be sold at the modified price.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the total profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}
     \]
     This formula correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, and the profit from these buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of the profits from the first `k` buns and the remaining `n - k` buns.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

The logic and the calculations implemented in the program are correct. It correctly handles all edge cases, including when `a >= b` and when `a < b`. The program efficiently computes the maximum profit for each test case within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
