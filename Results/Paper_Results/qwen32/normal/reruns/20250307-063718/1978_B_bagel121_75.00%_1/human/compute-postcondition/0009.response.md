Let's break down the given code and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). (Note: `t` does not affect the calculation of `ans + p2` directly, as it is not used in the provided code snippet.)
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is less than `b`.
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
`ans` is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k \right\rfloor \]
This formula calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers from `a` to `b`.

### Calculation of `p2`:
`p2` is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{p2} = (n - k) \times a \]
This formula calculates the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, each being `a`.

### Final Output:
The final output is the sum of `ans` and `p2`:
\[ \text{Output} = \text{ans} + \text{p2} \]

### Explanation:
- `k` is the number of elements taken from the range `[a, b]` to maximize the sum. It is the minimum of the number of elements in the range `[a, b]` (which is `b - a + 1`) and `n`.
- `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest numbers in the range `[a, b]`.
- `p2` is the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, all of which are `a`.

### Final Output Description:
The final output is the sum of the sum of the `k` largest numbers from `a` to `b` and the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, each being `a`.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, and p2 is the sum of the remaining n - k numbers, each being a)**
