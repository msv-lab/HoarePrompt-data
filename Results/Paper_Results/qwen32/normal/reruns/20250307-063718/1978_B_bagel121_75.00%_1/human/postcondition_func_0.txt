The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by selecting `n` integers where each integer is either `a` or between `a` and `b` (inclusive), with the goal of maximizing the sum.
