Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. If `a` >= `b`, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.**
