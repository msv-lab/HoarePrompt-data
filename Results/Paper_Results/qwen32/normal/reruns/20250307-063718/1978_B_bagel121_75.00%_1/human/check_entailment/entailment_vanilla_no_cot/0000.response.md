Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points:
1. **Promotion Strategy**:
   - Bob can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion would not yield a higher profit.
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the price of the `k`th bun in the promotion does not drop below `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The total profit from the first `k` buns sold under promotion is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2) * k`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then the sum of these two values.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Case 1: `a >= b`**:
  - Selling all buns at `a` is indeed optimal, and the program correctly handles this case.

- **Case 2: `a < b`**:
  - The program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the resulting profit.
  - The formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series is correct.
  - The program correctly handles large input values up to `10^9` due to using integer arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion strategy.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
