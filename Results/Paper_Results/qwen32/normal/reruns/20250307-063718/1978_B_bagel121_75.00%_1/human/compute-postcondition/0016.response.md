The code snippet calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `k` are already defined in the initial state. The other variables `t`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.**
