The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `p2`. It calculates `(n - k) * a` and assigns this result to `p2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are used in this calculation. The other variables (`t`, `b`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.
