The code calculates the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n` and assigns it to the variable `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

The value of `k` will be the smaller of the two values: `b - a + 1` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**
