The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Therefore, the list `path_ba` will now include the new element `n` at the end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and now also includes the value of `n`; `n` is the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` as found in the `previous` list. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the existing state of the variables without any changes.**
