The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```
This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `n` will now hold the value of the integer input provided.

The initial state mentioned that `u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index. The integers `u` and `v` are indices of vertices in the range 0 to n-1, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree.

After the input is taken, the value of `n` changes, but the structure and values of `u2vs`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged unless they are modified later in the code (which is not shown here).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index; `u` and `v` are indices of vertices in the range 0 to n-1; `n` is the input integer.**
