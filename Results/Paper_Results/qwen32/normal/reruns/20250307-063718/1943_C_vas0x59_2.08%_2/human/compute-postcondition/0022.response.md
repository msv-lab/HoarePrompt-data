To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet `a = func_1(d)` on the existing variables `u2vs` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume that `func_1` processes the list `d` and returns a value or a new list based on its implementation. 

Given the lack of specific details about `func_1`, we can only describe the output state in terms of the new variable `a` and the unchanged state of `u2vs` and `d`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
