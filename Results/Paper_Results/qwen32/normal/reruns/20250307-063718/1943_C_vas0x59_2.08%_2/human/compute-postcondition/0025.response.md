The code snippet `path_ba = [b]` creates a new list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`, where `b` is the result of the function `func_1(d)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**
