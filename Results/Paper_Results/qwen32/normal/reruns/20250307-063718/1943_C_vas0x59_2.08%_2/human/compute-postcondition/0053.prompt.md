Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and possibly other tuples; `i` is `k + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and possibly other tuples; `i` is `k + 2`; `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c, i)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
