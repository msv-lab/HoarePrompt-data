The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `ci`. If `i` is less than `ci + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and possibly other tuples; `i` is `k + 2`.**
