The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the variable `n` to the value of the predecessor of the last element in the `path_ba` list, as found in the `previous` list. This means `n` will now hold the index of the vertex that comes right before the last vertex in `path_ba` in the shortest path from vertex `0`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`; `n` is the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` as found in the `previous` list.**
