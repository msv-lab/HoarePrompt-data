The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. Since `_` is not affecting the loop's continuation condition, we need to focus on the loop's continuation condition itself, which is `n - 1`.

Given the loop `for _ in range(n - 1):`, the loop will execute `n - 1` times. If the loop has just finished an iteration, it means that one execution of the loop body has completed, and the loop counter has been incremented by 1 internally by Python.

Since the loop counter is handled internally and we don't have any control over it directly, the only thing we need to ensure is that the loop can execute one more time. This means that the loop counter (which we don't see) should be less than `n - 1` before the next iteration starts.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not contain any variables that we can modify to affect the loop's continuation, the state of `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, and `n` should remain the same. The loop will naturally continue to execute as long as the internal loop counter is less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains `v`, `u`, and `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` must be at least 2; the list at index `u` in `u2vs` contains `v`, `u`, and `v`.**
