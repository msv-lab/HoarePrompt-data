The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` modifies the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs` by appending the value of `u` to it.

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains `v` and `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` must be at least 2; the list at index `u` in `u2vs` now contains `v`, `u`, and `v`.

After the execution of `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` will have an additional element `u` appended to it. 

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains `v`, `u`, and `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` must be at least 2; the list at index `u` in `u2vs` contains `v`, `u`, and `v`.**

In simpler terms, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes an extra `u` at the end. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
