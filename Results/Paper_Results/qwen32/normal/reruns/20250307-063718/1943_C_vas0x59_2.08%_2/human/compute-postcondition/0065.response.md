The code snippet appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now have an additional element.

Initial State: 
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex.
- `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0` and must have at least 3 elements.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)`.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

After the code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` is executed, `ops` will now contain an additional tuple `(c2, i)`.
