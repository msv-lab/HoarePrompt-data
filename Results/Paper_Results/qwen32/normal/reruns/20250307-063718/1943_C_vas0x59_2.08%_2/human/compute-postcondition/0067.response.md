Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
