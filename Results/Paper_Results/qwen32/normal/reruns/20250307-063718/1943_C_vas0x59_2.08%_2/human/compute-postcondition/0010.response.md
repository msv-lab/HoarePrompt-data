Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains `v` and `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input; `n` must be at least 2.**

In natural language: The value of `u` has been decreased by 1. The list `u2vs` and the value of `v` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
