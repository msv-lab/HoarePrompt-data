Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and now also includes the value of `n`. If `n` was initially `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without updating `n`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**
