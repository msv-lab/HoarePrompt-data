Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`.**

In natural language: The loop continues to execute until the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` is `-1`, indicating that the path has been fully traced back to the starting vertex `0`. At this point, `path_ba` contains the indices of all vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, listed in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
