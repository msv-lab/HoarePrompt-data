The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, but `c` is described as the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is an additional variable that is not described further. Since `i` is not provided in the initial state, we will keep it as `i`.

The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and the precondition that the length of `path_ba` is odd with `ci` being the middle index) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0; `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`**.
