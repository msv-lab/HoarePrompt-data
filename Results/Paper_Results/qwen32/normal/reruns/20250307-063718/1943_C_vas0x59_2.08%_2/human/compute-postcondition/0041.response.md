The code snippet `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. This means that the list `path_ba` will now include the value of `n` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and now also includes the value of `n`. If `n` was initially `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without updating `n`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged. `path_ba` now includes the value of `n` as its last element. If `n` was initially `-1`, no further updates are made to `n`; otherwise, `n` is updated to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.
