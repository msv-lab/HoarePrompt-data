The code snippet `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `u` is `u - 1`; `v` is a specific integer provided by the input, representing indices of vertices in the range 0 to n-1, decremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2.**
