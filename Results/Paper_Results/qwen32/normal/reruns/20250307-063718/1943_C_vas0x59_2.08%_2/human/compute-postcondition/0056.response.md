The value of `c1` is assigned the value of `c2 - 1`. Given that `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, the value of `c1` will be one less than half the length of `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`; `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
