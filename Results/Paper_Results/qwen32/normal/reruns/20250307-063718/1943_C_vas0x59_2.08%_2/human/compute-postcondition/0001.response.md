The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a new list of lists where the number of inner lists is equal to the value of `n`. Each inner list is initially empty. This operation overwrites the previous value of `u2vs`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `u` and `v` are indices of vertices in the range 0 to n-1; `n` is the input integer.**
