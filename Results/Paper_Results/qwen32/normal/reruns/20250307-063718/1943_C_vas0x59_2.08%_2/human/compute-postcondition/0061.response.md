The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 3, the new tuple to be appended is `(c2 - 1, 3)`.

Since `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `c2` will be at least 1.5 (half of 3), but since `c2` is an integer (as it represents a length), `c2` will be at least 2. Therefore, `c1` will be at least 1.

The output state will reflect the updated `ops` list with the newly added tuple.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0` and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c2 - 1, 3)`**.
