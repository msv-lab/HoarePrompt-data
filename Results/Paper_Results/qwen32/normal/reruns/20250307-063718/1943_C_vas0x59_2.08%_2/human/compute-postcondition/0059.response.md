The code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now contain one additional element, which is the tuple `(c2, i)`. The values of `c2` and `i` remain unchanged, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0` and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`. `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
