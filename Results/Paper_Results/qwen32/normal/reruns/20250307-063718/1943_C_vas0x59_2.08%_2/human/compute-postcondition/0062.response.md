The provided code snippet appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the list `ops` initially contains the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2 - 1, 3)`. After appending `(c2, i)`, the list `ops` will now have three elements.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0` and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, i)`**.
