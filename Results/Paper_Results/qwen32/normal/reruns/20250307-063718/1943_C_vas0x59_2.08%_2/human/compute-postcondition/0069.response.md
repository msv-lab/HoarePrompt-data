To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the operations performed in the code snippet. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `u2vs`: A list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex.
   - `d`: A list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices, as computed by the `bfs` function.
   - `a` and `b`: Both are the result of applying `func_1` to the list `d`. Since they are identical, we can assume `a` and `b` are the same.
   - `previous`: A list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices.
   - `path_ba`: A list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`.
   - `ops`: This list is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`:
     - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
     - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

2. **Constructing `ops`:**
   - The construction of `ops` depends on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.
   - If the length is odd, `ops` will contain a series of tuples with the middle vertex index `c` and increasing indices from `0` to `ci`.
   - If the length is even, `ops` will contain pairs of tuples, each pair representing two vertices at positions `c1` and `c2` with increasing indices `i`.

3. **Printing the Output:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each element of `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - This means each vertex index `x[0]` in `ops` is incremented by 1 (presumably to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing), and the second element `x[1]` is kept as is.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument in the `print` function ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

4. **Final Output Description:**
   - The output will be a series of lines, each containing a vertex index (incremented by 1) followed by a number, separated by a space.
   - The exact values will depend on the specific construction of `ops`, which in turn depends on the length of `path_ba` and its contents.

Given the above analysis, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **(vertex_index_1 + 1) number_1
(vertex_index_2 + 1) number_2
...
(vertex_index_n + 1) number_n (where vertex_index_i and number_i are derived from the `ops` list as described)**

This output reflects the formatted values of `ops` with vertex indices incremented by 1.
