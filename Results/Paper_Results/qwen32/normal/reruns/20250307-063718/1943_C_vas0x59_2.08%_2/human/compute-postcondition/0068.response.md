Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `u2vs`: A list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex.
- `d`: A list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function.
- `a`: The result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous`: A list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices.
- `b`: The result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba`: A list containing the indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `0`.
- `ops`: A list of tuples based on the length of `path_ba`.
  - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
  - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ops))
```

### Analysis:
To determine what `len(ops)` will print, we need to analyze the structure and length of `path_ba` and how `ops` is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`.

1. **Length of `path_ba` is Odd:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be equal to `ci + 1`, which is half the length of `path_ba` plus one (since `ci` is the middle index).

2. **Length of `path_ba` is Even:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.
   - Here, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be equal to `c2`, which is half the length of `path_ba`.

### Conclusion:
- If the length of `path_ba` is `L`:
  - If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = (L + 1) // 2`.
  - If `L` is even, `len(ops) = L // 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of `ops` which is dependent on the length of `path_ba`.

### Final Output:
Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is the length of the ops list constructed based on the length of path_ba)**
