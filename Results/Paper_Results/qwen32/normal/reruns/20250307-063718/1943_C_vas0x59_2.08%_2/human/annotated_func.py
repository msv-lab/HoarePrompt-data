#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input to construct an adjacency list representing a tree, computes the longest path in the tree, and then generates a specific list of operations based on this path. It prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, where each operation is a tuple of a vertex index (adjusted to 1-based indexing) and a number. The function does not return any value.
