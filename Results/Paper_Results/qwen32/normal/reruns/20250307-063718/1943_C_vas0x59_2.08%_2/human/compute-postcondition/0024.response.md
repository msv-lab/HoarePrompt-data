The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `previous` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` will hold the same value as `a` because both are the result of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**
