The code snippet provided calls the `bfs` function with `0` as the starting vertex. The `bfs` function is assumed to perform a Breadth-First Search starting from the given vertex and returns two values: the distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices (`d`) and some other value which is ignored (`_`).

Given the initial state, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex. Since the `bfs` function is called with `0` as the argument, it will compute the shortest distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph represented by `u2vs`.

The output state will include the computed distances `d` from vertex `0` to all other vertices. The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices.**
