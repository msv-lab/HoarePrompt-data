Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex. Each vertex index is decremented by 1 to match the 0-based indexing used in Python lists.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `u2vs` will be a list of adjacency lists for a graph with `n` vertices. Each sublist at index `i` in `u2vs` will contain all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` (with vertex indices adjusted to be 0-based).
