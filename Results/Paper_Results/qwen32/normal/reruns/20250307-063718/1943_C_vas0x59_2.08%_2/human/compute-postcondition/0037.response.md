In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume there is no `break` statement that would terminate the loop based on the provided information.

Given that it is a `while True` loop, the state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute regardless of the state of the variables.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and now also includes the value of `n`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the existing state of the variables without any changes.**
