The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. 

Given the initial state, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`, and `u` is initially `u - 1`. The variable `v` is a specific integer provided by the input, representing indices of vertices in the range 0 to `n-1`, decremented by 1. The variable `n` must be at least 2.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `u` and `v` are updated based on the input provided. The initial state of `u2vs` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains `v` and `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `n` must be at least 2.**
