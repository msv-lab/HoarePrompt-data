In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Since there are no conditions in the loop head to adjust, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

Here is the state you provided, repeated as required:

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d); `previous` is a list containing the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` is the result of `func_1(d); `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and now also includes the value of `n`; `n` is the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` as found in the `previous` list. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the existing state of the variables without any changes.**
