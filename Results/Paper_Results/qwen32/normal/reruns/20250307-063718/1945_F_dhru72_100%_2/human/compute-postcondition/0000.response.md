The provided code snippet only declares a type variable `T` using Python's `TypeVar` from the `typing` module. This declaration does not affect the values of any existing variables or introduce any new variables that would change the initial state. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000. v is a list of integers of size n where each element v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
