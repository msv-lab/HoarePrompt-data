The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string; `unique_chars` is a list with `char` as the first element followed by the original `unique_chars`; `i` is 1; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1 + 1`; `char` is in `unique_chars`.** 

In simpler terms, `j` is now equal to its previous value plus one, while all other variables retain their initial values.
