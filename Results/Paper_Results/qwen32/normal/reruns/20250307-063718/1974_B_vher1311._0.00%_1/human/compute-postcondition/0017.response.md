Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
