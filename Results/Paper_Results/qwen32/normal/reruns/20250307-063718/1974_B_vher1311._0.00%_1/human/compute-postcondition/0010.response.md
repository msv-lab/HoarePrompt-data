Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `i` and `j` are updated based on whether `char` is in `unique_chars`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` remains sorted, `i` is 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is added as the first element of `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged, `i` is set to 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
