### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string.

1. **Program Overview:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Step 1:** It creates a list of unique characters from the string `s` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - **Step 2:** It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to point to the start and end of the unique characters list, respectively.
   - **Step 3:** It iterates through each character in the string `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b`).
     - **If the character is found in the unique characters list:**
       - It replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the character at the `j`-th position in the unique characters list and decrements `j`.
     - **If the character is not found in the unique characters list:**
       - It inserts the character at the `i`-th position in the unique characters list and adjusts the pointers `i` and `j`. However, this scenario should not occur given the problem constraints.
   - **Step 4:** Finally, it returns the joined string of the unique characters list.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Replacement Logic:**
  - The program attempts to replace all occurrences of a character in `s` with the corresponding character from `r` in each iteration. This is incorrect because the replacement should be done based on the mapping of characters from `r` to the original string `s`, not by modifying `s` in-place during the iteration.
- **Unnecessary Handling of Non-Unique Characters:**
  - The logic for handling characters not found in the unique characters list is incorrect and unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all characters in `b` will be in the unique characters list `r`.
- **Incorrect Return Statement:**
  - The final return statement `return ''.join(unique_chars)` returns the modified unique characters list instead of the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
- **Mapping Creation:**
  - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
- **Decoding Process:**
  - Using this mapping, decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
