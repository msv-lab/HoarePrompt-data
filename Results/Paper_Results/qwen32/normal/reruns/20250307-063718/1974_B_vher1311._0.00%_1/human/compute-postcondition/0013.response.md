The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The values of `s`, `unique_chars`, and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`; `j` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`; `j` is decreased by 1.**
