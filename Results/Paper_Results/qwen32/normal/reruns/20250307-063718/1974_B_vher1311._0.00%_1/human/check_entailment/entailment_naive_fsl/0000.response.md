Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem description. Let's break down the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The code attempts to replace characters in the string `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b` in the context of the problem) with characters from the reversed `unique_chars` list. However, it incorrectly uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` which replaces all occurrences of `char` in the string `s` with `unique_chars[j]` in one go. This is not what we want. Instead, we need to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` and then build the decoded string.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The code attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars` if they are not found, which is incorrect. The `unique_chars` list should only contain unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted alphabetically, and no new characters should be inserted into it during the decoding process.

3. **Incorrect Index Management**: The indices `i` and `j` are managed incorrectly. Specifically, `i` and `j` are not used correctly for mapping characters from `b` to `r`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    r = unique_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted unique characters
    mapping = {r[i]: unique_chars[i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
```

In this corrected version:
- We first create the list `unique_chars` which contains all unique characters from the encoded string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
- We then create a reversed version of `unique_chars` named `r`.
- We create a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in `unique_chars`.
- Finally, we build the decoded string by replacing each character in `s` with its mapped character from the dictionary.

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases as per the problem description.
