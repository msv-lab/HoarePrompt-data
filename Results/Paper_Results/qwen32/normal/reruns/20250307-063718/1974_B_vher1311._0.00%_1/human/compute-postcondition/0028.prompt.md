You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The length of the list s (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in s does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: `s` is modified with all occurrences of strings replaced by corresponding strings from `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique strings, `i` is the count of unique strings added during the loop, and `j` is the index of the last used string in `unique_chars` or `-1`.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string which is the concatenation of all unique strings in the sorted list `unique_chars`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the sorted list of unique strings within `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string which is the concatenation of all unique strings in the sorted list `unique_chars`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
