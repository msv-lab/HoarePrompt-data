Output State: **The program returns a string which is the concatenation of all unique strings in the sorted list `unique_chars`.**

This output state means that the function will return a single string formed by joining all the elements of the `unique_chars` list in the order they appear, since `unique_chars` is described as a sorted list of all unique strings.
