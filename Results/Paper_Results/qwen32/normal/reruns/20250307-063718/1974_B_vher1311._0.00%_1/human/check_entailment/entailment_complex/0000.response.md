Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly perform the decoding as described in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it sorts the unique characters of `b` and returns them, which is not the decoding process.

2. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace each character in `s` with a character from `unique_chars`, but it does so incorrectly. It replaces all occurrences of a character with the same character from `unique_chars`, which is not how the decoding should work. The decoding process requires mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Characters**: The function incorrectly handles characters that are not in `unique_chars` (which should not happen as all characters in `b` are part of `r`). It also does not correctly manage the indices `i` and `j` for the replacement process.

4. **Output Mismatch**: The function returns the sorted unique characters of `b`, which is not the original string `s`.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Extract the unique characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping to form the original string `s`.

Given the above points, the current program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
