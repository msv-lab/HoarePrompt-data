### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Construct String `r`:** Create a string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Encoding Process:** Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`. The first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.
3. **Decoding Process:** Given the encoded string `b`, reconstruct the original string `s` by reversing the above process.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string `b` but contains several logical errors.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
```

#### Annotations Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call:** The variable `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b` in the context of the problem) is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
- **State Inside Function:**
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`.
  - `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 and the last index of `unique_chars`, respectively.
  - The loop iterates over each character in `s`.
  - If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the character at index `j` in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`.
  - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at index `i` in `unique_chars`, increments `i`, and increments `j`.
- **State After Loop:** The function returns a string which is the concatenation of all unique characters in the sorted list `unique_chars`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic:** The line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` incorrectly replaces all occurrences of `char` in the string `s` with `unique_chars[j]` in one go. Instead, we need to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` and build the decoded string.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters:** The code attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars` if they are not found, which is incorrect. The `unique_chars` list should only contain unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted alphabetically, and no new characters should be inserted into it during the decoding process.
3. **Incorrect Index Management:** The indices `i` and `j` are managed incorrectly. Specifically, `i` and `j` are not used correctly for mapping characters from `b` to `r`.

#### Correct Approach:
The corrected version of the code should:
1. Create the list `unique_chars` which contains all unique characters from the encoded string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
2. Create a reversed version of `unique_chars` named `r`.
3. Create a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in `unique_chars`.
4. Build the decoded string by replacing each character in `s` with its mapped character from the dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    r = unique_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted unique characters
    mapping = {r[i]: unique_chars[i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem description. The provided annotations highlight the logical errors in the program. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
