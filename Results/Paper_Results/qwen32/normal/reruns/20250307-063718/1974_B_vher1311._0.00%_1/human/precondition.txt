The function `symmetric_encode` takes a single argument `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function is expected to perform encoding based on the described algorithm, but the precondition here is based on the input format described in the problem. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string `b`, and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
