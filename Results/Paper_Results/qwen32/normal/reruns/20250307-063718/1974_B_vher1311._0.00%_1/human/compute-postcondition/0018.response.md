The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s` and the variable `char`. Since `char` is the next element in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next element in `s` after the current one.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the current element in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more element. Therefore, `char` will be the next element in `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more element, `unique_chars` is a list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`.**
