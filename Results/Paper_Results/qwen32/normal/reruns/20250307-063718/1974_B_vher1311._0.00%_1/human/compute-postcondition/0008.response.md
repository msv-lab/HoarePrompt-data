Output State: **`s` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string; `unique_chars` is a list with `char` as the first element followed by the original `unique_chars`; `i` is 1; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`; `char` is in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
