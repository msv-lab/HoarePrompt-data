Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more element, `unique_chars` is a list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `s` has occurrences of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s` remains unchanged.**
