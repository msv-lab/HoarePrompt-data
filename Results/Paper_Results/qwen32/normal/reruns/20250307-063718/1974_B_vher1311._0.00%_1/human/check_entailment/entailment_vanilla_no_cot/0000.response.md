Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` in a way that does not match the described decoding process. It tries to replace characters with the last character in `unique_chars` and then decrement `j`, but this is not how the decoding should work. Instead, the program should map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in the string `s` using the symmetric character mapping from `r`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program uses `set` and `sorted` to find unique characters and sort them, which is correct for constructing `r`. However, it does not correctly map characters from `b` back to the original string `s`.

3. **Incorrect String Replacement**: The program uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`, which replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is incorrect because it modifies the string `s` in place during iteration, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Logic for Decoding**: The program should create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character and then use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list(set(s)))
    r = unique_chars
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    decoded_chars = [mapping[char] for char in s]
    return ''.join(decoded_chars)
```

In this corrected version:
- `unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters in `s`.
- `r` is the same as `unique_chars`.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- `decoded_chars` is a list of characters from `s` that have been decoded using the `mapping`.
- The final result is the joined string of `decoded_chars`.
