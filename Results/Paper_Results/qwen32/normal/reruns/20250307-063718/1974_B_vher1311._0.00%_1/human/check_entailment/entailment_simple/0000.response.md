### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string and then replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric counterpart from this sorted list. 

However, there are a few issues with the implementation of the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The program attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with its symmetric counterpart from `unique_chars`. However, the replacement is done using `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`, which replaces all occurrences of `char` in the entire string `s` at once. This is incorrect because we need to replace each occurrence of `char` with its corresponding symmetric character one by one.

2. **Incorrect Symmetric Mapping**: The program does not correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart. Instead, it modifies the string `s` in-place and changes `unique_chars` in a way that does not reflect the intended symmetric mapping.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is the concatenation of all unique characters in the sorted list `unique_chars`. This is not the decoded string; it is just the list of unique characters.

To correctly decode the string, we need to:
- Create the sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
- Create a mapping from each character in the sorted list to its symmetric counterpart.
- Use this mapping to decode the encoded string character by character.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Correctness:
Based on the issues identified in the original program, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
