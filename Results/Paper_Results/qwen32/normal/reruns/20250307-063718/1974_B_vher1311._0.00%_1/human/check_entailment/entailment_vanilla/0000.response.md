Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to point to the start and end of the unique characters list, respectively.
   - The loop iterates through each character in the encoded string `b`.
     - If the character is found in the unique characters list, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `b` with the character at the `j`-th position in the unique characters list and decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not found in the unique characters list (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), it inserts the character at the `i`-th position in the unique characters list and adjusts the pointers `i` and `j`.

3. **Issues in the Provided Program:**
   - The main issue is that the program attempts to replace all occurrences of a character in `b` with the corresponding character from `r` in each iteration, which is incorrect. This is because the replacement should be done based on the mapping of characters from `r` to the original string `s`, not by modifying `b` in-place during the iteration.
   - The logic for handling characters not found in the unique characters list is also incorrect and unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all characters in `b` will be in the unique characters list `r`.
   - The final return statement `return ''.join(unique_chars)` is incorrect because it returns the modified unique characters list instead of the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
- Then, using this mapping, the encoded string `b` can be decoded to the original string `s`.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
