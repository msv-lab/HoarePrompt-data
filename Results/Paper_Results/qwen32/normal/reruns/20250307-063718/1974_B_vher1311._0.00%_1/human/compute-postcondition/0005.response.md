The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings from the original `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`; `char` is in `unique_chars`.
