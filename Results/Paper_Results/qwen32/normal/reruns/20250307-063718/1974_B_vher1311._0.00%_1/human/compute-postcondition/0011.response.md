The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which is iterated over from the list `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the next element of `s` that `char` will take.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a list of strings.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings.
- `i` and `j` are updated based on whether `char` is in `unique_chars`.

Since `char` is the loop variable and is taken from `s`, we need to determine the next value of `char` by considering the current position in `s`. The loop iterates over each element in `s` one by one.

Let's assume that the previous iteration processed the `k`-th element of `s`. Therefore, the next iteration will process the `(k+1)`-th element of `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s` to be processed.**

Since the problem does not specify the exact position of the current iteration in `s`, we can denote the next element to be processed as `s[k+1]` where `k` is the index of the last processed element. However, for the sake of the state description, we can simply say `char` is the next element in `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`.**
