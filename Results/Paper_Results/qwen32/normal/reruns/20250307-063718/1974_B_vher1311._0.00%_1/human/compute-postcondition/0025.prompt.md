Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The length of the list s (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in s does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings from `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings, and `i` and `j` are updated based on whether `char` is in `unique_chars`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` remains sorted, `i` is 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is added as the first element of `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged, `i` is set to 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of strings with at least one more element, `unique_chars` is a list of unique strings, and `char` is the next element in `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `s` has occurrences of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
