Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The length of the list s (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in s does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings from `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**

This means that the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to the beginning and the end of the `unique_chars` list, respectively, while the other variables remain unchanged.
