Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The logic in the program is flawed as it only considers the sum of the maximum of all books except the last one and the last book itself, which does not necessarily yield the optimal solution.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation: Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 3 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 3 from the second pile. Thus, she will read a_2 + a_3 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

However, the provided program would output `5` for this input, which is incorrect. The program uses `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`, which in this case would be `max(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`, but the actual maximum sum is obtained by a different division of books.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
