The code snippet provided assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. The previous value of `n` is overwritten, and `t` and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
