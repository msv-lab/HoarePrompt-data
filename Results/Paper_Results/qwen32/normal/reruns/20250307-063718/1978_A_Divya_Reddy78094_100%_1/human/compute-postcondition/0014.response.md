Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books, followed by a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the number of pages in each book. The function processes each test case and returns the total number of pages across all books for each test case.**
