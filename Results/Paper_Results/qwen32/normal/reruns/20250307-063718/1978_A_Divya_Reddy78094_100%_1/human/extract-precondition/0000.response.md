Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each integer represents the number of pages in each book. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is given at the beginning of the input.**
