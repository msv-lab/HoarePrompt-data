The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value obtained from the input. The variables `t` and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
