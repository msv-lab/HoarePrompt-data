The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` is not used within the loop body, its value does not matter for the logic of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. After each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements `t` by 1 (even though `t` is not directly modified in the loop head). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since `n` and `nums` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted. They are simply inputs that are used within the loop body, and their states remain unchanged from one iteration to the next.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
