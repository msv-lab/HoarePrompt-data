The code snippet provided updates the `nums` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
In natural language: The number of test cases `t` and the new input integer `n` remain unchanged. The `nums` list is updated to contain integers from the new input line.
