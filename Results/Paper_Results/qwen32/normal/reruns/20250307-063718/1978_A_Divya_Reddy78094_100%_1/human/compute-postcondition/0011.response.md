The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. This means that `nums` will now hold the list of integers obtained from the new input.

The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than 0, and `n` remains the new input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
