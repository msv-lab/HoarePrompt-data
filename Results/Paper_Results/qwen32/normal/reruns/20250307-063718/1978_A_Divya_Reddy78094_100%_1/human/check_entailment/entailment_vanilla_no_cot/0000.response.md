Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always takes the last book and the maximum of the rest of the books, which does not necessarily yield the maximum total number of pages Alice can read. 

To correctly solve the problem, Alice should divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the maximum pages from each pile is maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the books by the number of pages in descending order and then splitting them into two piles. However, a simpler approach is to always take the two books with the most pages, as this guarantees the maximum sum of the highest pages from each pile.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort books in descending order
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])  # Sum of the two largest books

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected program sorts the books by the number of pages in descending order and then simply adds the two largest books, ensuring that Alice reads the maximum total number of pages.
