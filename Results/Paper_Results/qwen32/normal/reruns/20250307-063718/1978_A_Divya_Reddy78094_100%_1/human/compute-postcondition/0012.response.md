Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the new input integer, which is the length of the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nums[:-1]`**: This slice of the list `nums` includes all elements except the last one.
2. **`max(nums[:-1])`**: This finds the maximum value among the elements in `nums` excluding the last element.
3. **`nums[-1]`**: This is the last element of the list `nums`.
4. **`max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`**: This adds the maximum value from the elements excluding the last one to the last element of the list.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the sum of the maximum value from the list `nums` excluding the last element and the last element itself.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value in the list nums excluding the last element, and nums[-1] is the last element of the list nums)**
