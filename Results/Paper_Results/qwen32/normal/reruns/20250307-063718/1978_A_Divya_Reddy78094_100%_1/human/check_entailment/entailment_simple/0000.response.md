Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the highest number of pages from each pile. However, the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it calculates the sum of the highest number of pages from all books except the last one and the number of pages in the last book. This approach does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles and does not maximize the sum of the highest numbers from each pile.

For example, in the second test case of the provided input:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The correct output should be `4` (by putting books with numbers 2 and 3 in one pile and books with numbers 1 and 3 in the other pile, and reading the highest number in each pile, which is `3 + 1 = 4`). However, the current program would output `5` (by considering `max(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 5`), which is incorrect because it does not properly divide the books into two piles.

To fix the program, we need to find the two largest numbers in the list and sum them, as these two numbers represent the highest number of pages Alice can read from each pile, assuming the books are divided in a way that includes these two books in different piles.

Correctness: **False**
