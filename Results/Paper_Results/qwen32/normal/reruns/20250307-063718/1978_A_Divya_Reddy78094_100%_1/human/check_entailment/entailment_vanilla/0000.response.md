Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires Alice to divide her books into two non-empty piles and then read the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read.

The provided program takes the following approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books and the list of pages in each book.
3. It then calculates the sum of the maximum pages in the list excluding the last book and the pages in the last book (`max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`).

This approach does not guarantee that Alice will read the books with the highest number of pages from each pile. Instead, it always includes the last book in one pile and the maximum book from the rest in the other pile, which is not necessarily optimal.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The optimal way to divide the books would be to put books with 3 pages in one pile and books with 2 and 1 pages in the other pile, resulting in a total of 3 + 2 = 5 pages read. However, the provided program would output 3 + 1 = 4 pages read, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
