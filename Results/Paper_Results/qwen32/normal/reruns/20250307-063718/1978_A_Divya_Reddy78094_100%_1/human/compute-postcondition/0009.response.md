The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1, since each iteration of the loop corresponds to processing one test case.

Given this, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.** 

However, to be more precise, since `t` needs to be decremented for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 after decrementing by 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

To make it clear that `t` has been decremented:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
