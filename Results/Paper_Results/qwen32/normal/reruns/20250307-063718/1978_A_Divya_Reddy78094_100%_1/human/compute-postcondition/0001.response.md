The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
