To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the components and the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`nums[:-1]`**: This slice notation means all elements of the list `nums` except the last one. So, `nums[:-1]` is a sublist of `nums` that excludes the last element.
2. **`max(nums[:-1])`**: This will find the maximum value in the sublist `nums[:-1]`.
3. **`nums[-1]`**: This refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
4. **`max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`**: This expression adds the maximum value from the sublist `nums[:-1]` to the last element of the list `nums`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the sum of the maximum value in the sublist `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value in the sublist of nums excluding the last element, and nums[-1] is the last element of the list nums)**
