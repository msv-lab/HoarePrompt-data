You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of books and the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the pages of all books except the last one, adds the number of pages in the last book, and prints this total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The logic in the program is flawed as it only considers the sum of the maximum of all books except the last one and the last book itself, which does not necessarily yield the optimal solution.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation: Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 3 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 3 from the second pile. Thus, she will read a_2 + a_3 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

However, the provided program would output `5` for this input, which is incorrect. The program uses `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`, which in this case would be `max(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`, but the actual maximum sum is obtained by a different division of books.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
