The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
