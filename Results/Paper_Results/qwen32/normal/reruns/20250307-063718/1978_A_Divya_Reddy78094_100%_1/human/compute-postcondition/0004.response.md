To determine what will be printed, let's break down the code and the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` computes the maximum value among all elements of `nums` except the last one.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
   - `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements to the last element of the list.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The code prints the sum of the maximum value among the first `n-1` elements of `nums` and the last element of `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `nums`.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value among the first n-1 elements of nums, and nums[-1] is the last element of nums)**
