The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(l)`. Since `i` is the loop variable and `len(l)` is the length of the list `l`, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. The length of `l` does not need to be adjusted because it is a constant during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of its initial value (1) and `l[i]`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`, `i` is 1, and `l` is a list with at least 1 element.**
