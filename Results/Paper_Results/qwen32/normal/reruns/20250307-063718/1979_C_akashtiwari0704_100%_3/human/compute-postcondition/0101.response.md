Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with `a[1]` modified to `prod // a[1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + a[1]`, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

Explanation: The value of `sumo` is updated to be `sumo + a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
