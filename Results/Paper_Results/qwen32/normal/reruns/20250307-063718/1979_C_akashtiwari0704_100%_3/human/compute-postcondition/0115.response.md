The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans` will have the string representation of `a[2]` added to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with each `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]` for all i from 0 to bets-1, `prod` is the least common multiple of the initial list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to bets-1, `i` is 2, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and then the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space.**
