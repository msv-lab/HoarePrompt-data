To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variable `g`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and updates `g` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of its current value and the current element of `l`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

Here, `g` is initially set to 1. The loop will execute `len(l)` times, and after each iteration, `g` will be updated to the LCM of its previous value and the current element of `l`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `g` is the LCM of its initial value (1) and `l[0]`.
- After the second iteration, `g` is the LCM of its previous value (LCM(1, `l[0]`)) and `l[1]`.
- After the third iteration, `g` is the LCM of its previous value (LCM(LCM(1, `l[0]`), `l[1]`)) and `l[2]`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, `g` will be the LCM of all elements in the list `l`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains the same (integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4).
- `T` remains 2.
- `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.
- `bets` remains the same (integer read from the input and must be greater than 0).
- `a` remains the same (new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`).
- `prod` remains the same (least common multiple of the list `a`).
- `sumo` remains the same (sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`).
- `i` will be `len(l) - 1` (the last index of the list `l`).
- `l` remains the same (list with at least `bets + 1` elements).

Output State: **t is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, T is 2, g is the least common multiple of all elements in the list l, bets is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, a is a new list of integers read from the input with the first bets elements updated to prod // a[i] for each i from 0 to bets-1, prod is the least common multiple of the list a, sumo is the sum of the first bets elements of the updated list a, i is len(l) - 1, and l is a list with at least bets + 1 elements.**

In simple terms, the final state is that `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states or states after the first `bets` elements of `a` were updated.
