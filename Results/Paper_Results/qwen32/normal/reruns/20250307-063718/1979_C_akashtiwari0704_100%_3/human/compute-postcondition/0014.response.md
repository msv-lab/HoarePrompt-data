The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. 

The variables `t`, `T`, and `g` remain unchanged. The variable `bets` is also unchanged. The new variable `a` is introduced and assigned a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
