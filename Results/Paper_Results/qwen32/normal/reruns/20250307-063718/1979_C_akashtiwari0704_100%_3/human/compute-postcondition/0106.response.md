Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where each `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all i from 0 to bets-1, `prod` is the least common multiple of the initial list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to bets-1, `i` is `bets - 1`, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
