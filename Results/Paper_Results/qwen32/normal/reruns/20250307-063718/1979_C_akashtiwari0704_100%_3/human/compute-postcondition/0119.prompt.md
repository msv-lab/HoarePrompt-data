Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets - 1. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program continues with the current state. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces, with an additional trailing space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program does not change the state further. Otherwise, the program outputs the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where each `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all i from 0 to bets-1, `prod` is the least common multiple of the initial list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to bets-1, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the condition holds as described. Otherwise, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` each followed by a space, and `ans` ends with a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
