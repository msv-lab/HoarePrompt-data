The provided code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that the previous list `a` is overwritten with the new list of integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is `len(l) - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**
