The code snippet provided increments the variable `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, this means `sumo` will be updated by the value of `a[2]`.

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the 1st element unchanged, the 2nd element updated to `prod // a[1]`, and the 3rd element updated to `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.

After executing the code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])`, the value of `sumo` will be `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the 1st element unchanged, the 2nd element updated to `prod // a[1]`, and the 3rd element updated to `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**
