Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets - 1. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program continues with the current state. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces, with an additional trailing space.**
