The code snippet modifies the variable `g` by multiplying it with the `i`-th element of the list `l` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. This operation effectively updates `g` to the least common multiple (lcm) of its current value and `l[i]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `g`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of its initial value (1) and `l[i]`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`, `i` is 0, and `l` is a list with at least 1 element.**
