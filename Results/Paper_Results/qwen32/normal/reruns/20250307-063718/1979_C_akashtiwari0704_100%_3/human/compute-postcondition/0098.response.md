The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `a[i]` is already an integer (as it is derived from `prod // a[i]`), the `int()` conversion does not change its value. Therefore, `sumo` is simply incremented by `a[i]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + a[i]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

In natural language: After executing the code, `sumo` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
