The given code modifies the variable `g` by multiplying it with the `i`-th element of the list `l` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The variables `t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`, and `l` are not modified by this code snippet.

Let's break down the change:
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
- All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets - 1, and `l` is a list with at least one element.**
