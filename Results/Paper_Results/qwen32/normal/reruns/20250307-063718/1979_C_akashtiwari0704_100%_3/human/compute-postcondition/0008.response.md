Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `T`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
