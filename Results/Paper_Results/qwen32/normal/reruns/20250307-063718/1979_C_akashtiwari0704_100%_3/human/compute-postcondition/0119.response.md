Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` ranges from 0 to t-1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l` for each iteration, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0 for each iteration, `a` is a list of integers read from the input for each iteration where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a` for each iteration, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets) for each iteration, `i` is `bets - 1` for each iteration, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements for each iteration. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces, with an additional trailing space, which is printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (`prod`) of a list of integers `a`. It then updates each element of `a` to be the integer division of `prod` by the original element, and sums these updated elements (`sumo`). If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the updated list `a` as a space-separated string with an extra space at the end.
