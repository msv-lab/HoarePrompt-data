To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **T**: Initialized to 0 (though T is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned for completeness).
3. **g**: The least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l` (though `l` is not mentioned in the code snippet, it is mentioned for completeness).
4. **bets**: An integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
5. **a**: A list of integers read from the input where each \(a[i]\) for \(i\) in range(bets) is now \( \text{prod} // a[i] \).
6. **prod**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`.
7. **sumo**: The sum of all \(a[i]\) for \(i\) in range(bets), and it is less than `prod`.
8. **ans**: A string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces, with an additional trailing space.

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is constructed by joining all elements of the list `a` with spaces and appending a trailing space.
- Therefore, the output will be a string that represents the elements of `a` separated by spaces, followed by an extra space.

### Example:
If `a` is `[2, 3, 6]`, then `ans` will be `"2 3 6 "`. This is because the elements of `a` are joined with spaces and an additional trailing space is appended.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the string that contains all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces, with an additional trailing space.

Output: **a[0] a[1] ... a[bets-1] ** (where each `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` and there is an additional trailing space)
