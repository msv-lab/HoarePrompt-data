The code snippet `bets = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `bets`. The initial state does not mention any variable named `bets`, so it is introduced by this line. The other variables `t`, `T`, and `g` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `t` remains an integer read from the input within the given range, `T` is still 0, `g` is still the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, and a new variable `bets` is introduced, which holds an integer value read from the input.
