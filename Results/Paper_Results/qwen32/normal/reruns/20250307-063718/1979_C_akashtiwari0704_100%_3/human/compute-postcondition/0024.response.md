Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[0]` is now `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is now `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is now `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 2**.

In simple terms, the value of `a[2]` has been updated to be `prod // a[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
