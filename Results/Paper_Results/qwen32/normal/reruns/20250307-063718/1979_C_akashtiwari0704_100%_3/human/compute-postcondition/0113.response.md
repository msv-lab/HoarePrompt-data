The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `a[1]` will be converted to a string and appended to `ans`.

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with each `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]` for all i from 0 to bets-1, `prod` is the least common multiple of the initial list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to bets-1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.

After executing the code snippet, `ans` will be updated to include `a[1]` as a string followed by a space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with each `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]` for all i from 0 to bets-1, `prod` is the least common multiple of the initial list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to bets-1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
