To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to know the value of the variable `ans` based on the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not explicitly define the value of `ans`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `ans`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variable in the print statement**: The variable in the print statement is `ans`.
2. **Determine the value of `ans`**: Since the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `ans`, we cannot determine a specific value for it.
3. **Formulate the output**: Because we do not have a specific value for `ans`, we will describe the output in terms of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
