To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `T` is 0
- `g` is 1
- `l` is a list with at least one element

The code snippet:
```python
g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

This line updates the value of `g` based on its current value, an element from the list `l` at index `i`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. 

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we will consider `l[i]` as an element of the list `l`. The new value of `g` will be the product of `g` and `l[i]`, divided by their gcd.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element.**

In natural language: The value of `g` is updated to the result of `g` multiplied by `l[i]` and then divided by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `l` remain unchanged.
