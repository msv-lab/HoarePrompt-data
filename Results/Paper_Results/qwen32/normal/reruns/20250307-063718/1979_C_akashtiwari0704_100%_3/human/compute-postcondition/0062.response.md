The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, `sumo` will be updated to `sumo + a[1]`. 

Here are the details of the output state:
- `t` is still an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `T` is still 1.
- `g` is still the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.
- `bets` is still an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is still a new list of integers read from the input with the 1st element unchanged and the 2nd element updated to `prod // a[1]`.
- `prod` is still the least common multiple of the list `a`.
- `sumo` is now `sumo + a[1]`, which means it is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`.
- `i` is still 1.
- `l` is still a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the 1st element unchanged and the 2nd element updated to `prod // a[1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`, `i` is 1, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**
