To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Variable `g` Calculation**:
   - `g` is updated in each iteration to be the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `g` and `l[i]`. This is achieved by the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs for the length of the list `l`. Therefore, after `len(l)` iterations, `g` will be the LCM of all elements in `l`.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the input and not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is initialized to 1 and not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: After all iterations, `g` will be the least common multiple of all elements in `l`.
- **`bets`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the input and not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is computed before the loop starts and not modified within the loop.
- **`prod`**: Remains unchanged as it is computed before the loop starts and not modified within the loop.
- **`sumo`**: Remains unchanged as it is computed before the loop starts and not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `len(l) - 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is used to update `g` but not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is `len(l) - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

In simpler terms, `g` will be the LCM of all elements in `l`, and `i` will be the last index of `l` after the loop completes. All other variables remain in their initial state.
