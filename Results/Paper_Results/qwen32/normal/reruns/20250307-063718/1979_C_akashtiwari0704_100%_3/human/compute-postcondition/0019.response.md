The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `a[0]`.

Therefore, `sumo` will be updated to its current value plus `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[0]` is now `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[0]`, `i` is 0**.
