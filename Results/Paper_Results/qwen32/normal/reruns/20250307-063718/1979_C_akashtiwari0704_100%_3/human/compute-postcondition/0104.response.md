Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with `a[1]` modified to `prod // a[1]` and `a[2]` modified to `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + a[2]`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

Natural language: The value of `sumo` has been updated to include `a[2]`, so `sumo` is now equal to its previous value plus `a[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
