The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `bets`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `bets + 1`. The length of the list `l` is at least `bets + 1`, so the loop can indeed execute again with the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets + 1, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**
