The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(l)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `T` is 0.
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

To proceed with the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment it again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 2**.

However, to be precise and align with the loop's condition, we should state `i` as the incremented value directly:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**.

But since `i` was already incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` again:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1** (reflecting the start of the next iteration where `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous state).

To clearly indicate the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the next index to be processed**.

Given the loop condition, the precise state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being incremented:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To explicitly show the next value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented to the next index**.

Final and precise state:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**.
