To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over a list `l` of integers, and for each element `l[i]`, it updates the variable `g` using the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Here, `gcd` stands for the greatest common divisor.

The loop runs for `len(l)` iterations, meaning it processes each element in the list `l`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, `t` is an integer read from the input, `T` is 0, and `g` is 1.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each element `l[i]` in the list `l`, `g` is updated. The operation `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` effectively computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `g` and `l[i]`. This is because `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` is the formula for the LCM of two numbers.

After all iterations, `g` will be the least common multiple of all the elements in the list `l`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `T` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `g` is updated to the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.**
