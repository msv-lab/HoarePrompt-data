Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

The variable `sumo` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
