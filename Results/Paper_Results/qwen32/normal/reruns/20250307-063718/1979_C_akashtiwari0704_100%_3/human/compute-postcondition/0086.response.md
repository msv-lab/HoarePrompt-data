The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list with at least 1 element.

The loop condition is `for i in range(len(l))`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The list `l` does not need to be modified as the loop condition only depends on the index `i` and the length of `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of its previous value and `l[i]`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list with at least 1 element.**
