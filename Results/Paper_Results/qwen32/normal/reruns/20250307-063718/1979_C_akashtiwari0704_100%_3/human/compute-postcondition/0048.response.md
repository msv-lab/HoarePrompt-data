The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `g` using a specific formula involving `g`, `l`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The new value of `g` is calculated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets + 1, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**
