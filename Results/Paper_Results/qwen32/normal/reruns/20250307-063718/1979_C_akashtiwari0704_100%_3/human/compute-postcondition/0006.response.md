Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language description: The variable `g` is recalculated to be `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` has been incremented by 1.
