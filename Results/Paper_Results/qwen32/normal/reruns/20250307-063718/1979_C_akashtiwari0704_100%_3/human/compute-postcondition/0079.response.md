Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program does not change the state further. Otherwise, the program outputs the current state.**
