The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `T`, `g`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print(-1)` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement is an explicit instruction to output the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(-1)` statement is:

Output: **-1**
