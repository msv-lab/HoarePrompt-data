Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets), `i` is bets - 1, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` now contains the string representation of the last element of the list `a` followed by a space, while all other variables retain their previous values.
