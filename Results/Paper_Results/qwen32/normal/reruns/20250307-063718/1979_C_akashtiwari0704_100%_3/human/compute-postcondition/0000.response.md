The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`) are not affected by this line of code and remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
