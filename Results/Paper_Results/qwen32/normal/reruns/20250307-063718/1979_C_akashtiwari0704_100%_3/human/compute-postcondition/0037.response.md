The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `T` is 0
- `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`
- `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`
- `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`
- `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets)
- `i` is 0
- `sumo` is less than `prod`
- `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[i]` again followed by another space.

After executing the code snippet, `ans` will have the value of `a[i]` appended to it twice, each time followed by a space. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain the value of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[0]` again followed by another space, and then the value of `a[0]` followed by a space once more.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`; `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each `a[i]` for i in range(bets) is now `prod // a[i]`; `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` for i in range(bets); `i` is 0; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[0]` again followed by another space, and then the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.**
