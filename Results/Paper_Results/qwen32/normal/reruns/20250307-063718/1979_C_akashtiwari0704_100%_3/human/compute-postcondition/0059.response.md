Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `bets` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[0])`, `i` is 0, and `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements.**

In natural language: The value of `sumo` has been updated to be the integer value of the first element of the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
