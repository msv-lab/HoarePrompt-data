The code `x = int(input())` will reassign the variable `x` to the new integer value provided by the input. The variables `y` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Since `y` and `i` are defined based on the initial value of `x`, their values remain the same in terms of the relationship with the new `x`.

Output State: **the input to `int(input())` must be at least 1; `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided; `y` is `x - 1` (based on the new `x`); `i` is `x` (based on the new `x`).**
