Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While it is true that `x - 1` is a valid candidate for `y` because \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\), this does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for all possible values of `x`.

To illustrate, let's consider a few cases:

1. For `x = 10`, the program outputs `y = 9`. However, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\). So, `y = 5` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

2. For `x = 7`, the program outputs `y = 6`. Here, \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is correct, but it does not check if there is a better `y`.

3. For `x = 21`, the program outputs `y = 20`. However, \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is greater than \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\). So, `y = 18` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

4. For `x = 100`, the program outputs `y = 99`. However, \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100\), which is greater than \(\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100\). So, `y = 98` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

In all these cases, the program does not necessarily find the `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
