You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Output

    18

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: i is t - 1, t remains the same, x and y are not retained after the loop ends.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While it is true that `x - 1` is a valid candidate for `y` because \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\), this does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for all possible values of `x`.

To illustrate, let's consider a few cases:

1. For `x = 10`, the program outputs `y = 9`. However, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\). So, `y = 5` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

2. For `x = 7`, the program outputs `y = 6`. Here, \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is correct, but it does not check if there is a better `y`.

3. For `x = 21`, the program outputs `y = 20`. However, \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is greater than \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\). So, `y = 18` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

4. For `x = 100`, the program outputs `y = 99`. However, \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100\), which is greater than \(\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100\). So, `y = 98` is also a valid and optimal answer, but the program does not find it.

In all these cases, the program does not necessarily find the `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
