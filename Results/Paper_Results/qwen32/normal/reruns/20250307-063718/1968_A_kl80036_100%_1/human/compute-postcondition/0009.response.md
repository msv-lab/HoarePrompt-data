The input to `int(input())` must be at least `x + 1`; `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided; `y` is `x - 1`; `i` is `x + 1`

After executing `x = int(input())`, `x` is updated to the new input value. The conditions and relationships involving `y` and `i` need to be recalculated based on this new `x`.

Output State: **the input to `int(input())` must be at least `x + 1`; `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided; `y` is `x - 1`; `i` is `x + 1`.**

In simple terms: The new input value is assigned to `x`. `y` is then recalculated as `x - 1`, and `i` is recalculated as `x + 1`. The precondition that the input must be at least `x + 1` still holds with the new value of `x`.
