The code `y = x - 1` updates the value of `y` to be `x - 1`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged as it is already set to the value of `x` before the code execution.

Output State: **the input to `int(input())` must be at least 1; `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided; `y` is `x - 1`; `i` is `x`.**
