Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply outputs \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. 

To solve the problem, you need to find a value of \( y \) such that the sum of \( \gcd(x, y) \) and \( y \) is maximized. The given program does not perform any calculations to determine the greatest common divisor or check if the sum is maximized. 

A correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \( y \) and calculating \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) to find the maximum sum.
