You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: i is t - 1, t remains the same, x and y are not retained after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`. The values of `t` and `x` are not retained after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `x`. It then sets `y` to `x - 1` and prints `y`. The program assumes that `y = x - 1` will always yield the maximum possible value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

However, this assumption is not always correct. To maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`, we need to carefully choose `y` such that the sum of `\gcd(x, y)` and `y` is maximized. Simply choosing `y = x - 1` does not guarantee this.

For example, consider `x = 10`. The program would output `y = 9`, but the actual optimal `y` is `5` because `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7`, which is greater than `\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10`.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
