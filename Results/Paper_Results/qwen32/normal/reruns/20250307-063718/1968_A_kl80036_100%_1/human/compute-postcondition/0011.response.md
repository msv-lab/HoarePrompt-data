Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The input to `int(input())` must be at least `x + 1`.
- `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.
- `i` is defined as `x + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Constraint**: The input provided to `int(input())` must be at least `x + 1`. However, since `x` is the value of the input, this constraint is circular. We can interpret this as the input being some integer value `x`.
2. **Variable Assignments**:
   - `x` is assigned the value of the input.
   - `y` is assigned the value `x - 1`.
   - `i` is assigned the value `x + 1`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

### Output:
Since `y` is defined as `x - 1` and `x` is the value of the input, the print statement will output the value of `x - 1`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is the value of the input)**

However, for a more precise and clear output, we can say:

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the value of the input)**
