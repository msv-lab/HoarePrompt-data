Let's break down the given task step by step based on the provided initial state.

**Initial State:**
- The input to `int(input())` must be at least 1.
- `x` is an integer value equal to the input provided.
- `y` is `x - 1`.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(y)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. The user is prompted to provide an integer input that is at least 1.
2. This input is then converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `x`.
3. The variable `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.

Given these steps, the value of `y` will always be one less than the value of `x`.

**Output Description:**
Since the exact value of `x` (and thus `y`) is not specified, we describe `y` in terms of `x`. The print statement will output the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is the integer input provided by the user, which is at least 1)**
