Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State
1. The input to `int(input())` must be at least 1.
2. `x` is an integer value equal to the new input provided.
3. `y` is `x - 1`.
4. `i` is `x`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. The user provides an integer input `x` which is at least 1.
2. `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
3. The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`.

Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, the output will be the input value minus 1. However, since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

### Output
Output: **x - 1 (where x is the integer input provided by the user and is at least 1)**
