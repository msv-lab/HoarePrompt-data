To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the given information.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each iteration, `x` is read as an integer input, and `y` is calculated as `x - 1`. The value of `y` is then printed.

Let's break down the loop execution:
1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. For each iteration `i` (from 0 to `t-1`):
   - `x` is read as an integer input.
   - `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
   - `y` is printed.

The final output state will be reached after all `t` iterations have completed. At this point, `i` will be equal to `t - 1` (since `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`), and the last value of `x` will be the value read during the last iteration. The value of `y` will be the last calculated value, which is the last `x` minus 1.

However, the state of `x` and `y` after the loop ends won't be retained outside the loop in the provided code, as they are local to each iteration. The only variable that retains its value after the loop is `i`, which will be `t - 1` at the end of the loop.

The state of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is the number of iterations and is not modified inside the loop.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `i` will be `t - 1`.
- `t` remains the same as the initial input.
- `x` and `y` are not retained after the loop ends, but the last calculated `y` would be the last `x - 1`, if needed.

Output State: **i is t - 1, t remains the same, x and y are not retained after the loop ends.**
