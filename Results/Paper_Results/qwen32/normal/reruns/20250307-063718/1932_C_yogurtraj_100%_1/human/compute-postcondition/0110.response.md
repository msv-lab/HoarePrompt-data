Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is -1, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l`, `q1` is `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `q1 - 1`, and `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'R', otherwise `k` remains unchanged.**
