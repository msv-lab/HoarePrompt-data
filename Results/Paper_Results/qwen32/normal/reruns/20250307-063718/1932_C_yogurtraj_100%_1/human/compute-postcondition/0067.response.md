The code snippet provided is `q1 -= 1`, which means the value of `q1` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`; `q1` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `k` has been updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and the value of `q1` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
