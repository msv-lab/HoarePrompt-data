The value of `q1` is updated to `l - 2`. Since `l` is 0, `q1` becomes `-2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, and the last character of `t` is 'L'. `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `k` is the last element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -2, `q2` is 0.**
