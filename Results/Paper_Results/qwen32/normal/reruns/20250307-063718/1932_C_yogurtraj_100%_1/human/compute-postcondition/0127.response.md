To determine the output of the `print(*y)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the list `y` is constructed.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is the new input string.
- `ii` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`.
- `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-2`) is the value of `k` at that step of the loop.
- `i` is -1.
- `q2` and `q1` are updated based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' characters.

### Analysis:
The variable `y` is described as a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-2`) is the value of `k` at that step of the loop. This implies that `y` is populated during a loop that runs `n-1` times, and `k` is some variable that gets updated during each iteration.

However, the exact value of `k` and how it is updated is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the structure of the list `y` based on the information given.

### Output Description:
Since the exact value of `k` and the loop logic are not provided, we can only describe the list `y` in terms of its structure. The list `y` will contain `n-1` elements, each of which is the value of `k` at each step of the loop.

Output: **y (where y is a list of n-1 elements, each element being the value of k at each step of the loop)**
