Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is updated to `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1. `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`.**
