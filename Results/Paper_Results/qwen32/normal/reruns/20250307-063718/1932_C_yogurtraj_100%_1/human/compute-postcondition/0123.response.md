Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`, `q1` is `l - 2` if `t[i]` is 'R' else `l - 3`, `q2` is `l + 2` if `t[i]` is 'R' else `l + 1`, `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`**

Explanation: The value of `q1` is decremented by 1, so if `t[i]` is 'R', `q1` changes from `l - 1` to `l - 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` changes from `l - 2` to `l - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
