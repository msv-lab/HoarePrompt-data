Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `(k * a[1]) % m`, `q1` is -1, and `q2` is 2. Otherwise, if the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `(a[-1] % m) * a[-2] % m`, `q1` is -3, and `q2` is 0; otherwise, `k` is `(a[0] % m) * a[-1] % m`, `q1` is -2, and `q2` is 1.**
