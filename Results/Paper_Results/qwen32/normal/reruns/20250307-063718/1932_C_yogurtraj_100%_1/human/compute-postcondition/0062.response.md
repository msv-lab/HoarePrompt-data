Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. The current character at index `i` of `t` is 'R'.**
