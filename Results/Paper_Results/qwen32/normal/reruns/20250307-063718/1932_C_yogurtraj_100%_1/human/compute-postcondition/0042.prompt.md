Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is the last element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -2, and `q2` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the first element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -1, and `q2` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is calculated based on the conditions specified, `q1` is -1, -3, or -2, and `q2` is 2, 0, or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`, `q1` is -1, -3, or -2, and `q2` is 2, 0, or 1. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is updated to 3, 1, or 2. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is updated to -2, -4, or -3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` set to `k`, `i` is `n - 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
