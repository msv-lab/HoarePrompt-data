Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` (which is -1) also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `q1 - 2`, and `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`.**

In simple terms, the value of `q1` is decremented by 1, so if the last character of `t` is 'R', `q1` becomes `l - 2`; otherwise, `q1` becomes `q1 - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
