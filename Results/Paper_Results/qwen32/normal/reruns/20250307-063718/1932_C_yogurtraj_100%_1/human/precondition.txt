t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m, (a, s)). n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 <= ai <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
