The code snippet `t = input()` changes the type of `t` from an integer to a string, as `input()` always returns a string. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer.**
