Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, the element at index `n - 2` set to `k`, and the element at index `n - 3` also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `(k * a[q1]) % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
