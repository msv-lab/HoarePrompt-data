The code snippet `q2 = l` assigns the value of `l` to `q2`. Given that `l` is initially 0, `q2` will now also be 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, and the last character of `t` is 'L'. `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `k` is the last element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -2, `q2` is 0.**
