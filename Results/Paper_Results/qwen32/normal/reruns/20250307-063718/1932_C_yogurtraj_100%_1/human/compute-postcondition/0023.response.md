Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is the last element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -2, and `q2` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the first element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -1, and `q2` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`. The character at index `i` of `t` is not 'R'**
