You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: `ii` is `t-1`, `n` is the number of elements in the last `a`, `m` is the modulus from the last test case, `a` is the list of integers from the last test case, `t` is the string from the last test case, `l` is the count of 'L' in the last `t`, `y` is the list of results from the last test case, `i` is -1, `q1` and `q2` are the final indices from the last test case, and `k` is the final value of `k` from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a corresponding string of 'L' and 'R' characters. For each test case, it computes a new list based on specific rules involving the integers, the string, and a given modulus. The result for each test case is printed as a space-separated string of integers.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the product of the array elements and their remainders after each command.

Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Initialization of `k` and `q1`, `q2`:**
   The program initializes `k` based on the last command and the count of 'L' commands. This is incorrect because the product should be calculated from the full array initially, and then updated based on the commands.

2. **Loop for calculating remainders:**
   The loop iterates backwards from the end of the commands, which is not aligned with the problem statement that requires processing commands from the beginning.

3. **Updating the product:**
   The product `k` is updated incorrectly. The program does not correctly maintain the product of the remaining elements after each command.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # List to store the remainders
        remainders = []
        
        # Process each command
        for command in commands:
            remainders.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
                a.pop()
        
        # Print the remainders
        print(*remainders)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements modulo `m` is calculated.
- For each command, the current product is stored in the `remainders` list.
- The product is updated by removing the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command. The modular multiplicative inverse is used to remove an element from the product.

This corrected version should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
