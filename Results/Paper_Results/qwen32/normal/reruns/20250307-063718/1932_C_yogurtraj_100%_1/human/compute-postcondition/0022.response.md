Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `k` is `(k * a[1]) % m`, `q1` is -1, `q2` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `q2` is incremented by 1, so `q2` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
