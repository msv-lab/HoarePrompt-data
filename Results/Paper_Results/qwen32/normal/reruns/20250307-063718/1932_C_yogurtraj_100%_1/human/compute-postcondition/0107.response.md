Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is -1, `q2` is `l`. The last character of `t` is not 'R'. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` and `q1` is `l - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m` and `q1` is `l - 1`**
