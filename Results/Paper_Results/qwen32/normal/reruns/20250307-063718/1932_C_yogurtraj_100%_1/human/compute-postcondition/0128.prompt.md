Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` set to `k` for all `i` from `n-2` to `0`, `i` is -1, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` is -1 minus the number of 'L' characters in `t` from index `n-2` to `0`, and `q2` is 1 plus the number of 'R' characters in `t` from index `n-2` to `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is the new input string, ii is 1, n is the first integer from the new input, m is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n zeros where the elements from index n-2 to 0 are updated values of k based on the loop, i is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-2`) is the value of `k` at that step of the loop, `i` is -1, `q2` is updated based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' characters, and `q1` is updated based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
