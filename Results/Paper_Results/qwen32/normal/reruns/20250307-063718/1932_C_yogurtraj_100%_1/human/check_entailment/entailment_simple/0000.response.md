### Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the remainder of the product of the array elements modulo `m` after each command is processed. However, there are several issues with the logic and the implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2`:**
   - The program initializes `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the last command in the string `t`. This is incorrect because the product and the indices should be initialized based on the entire array, not just the last command.

2. **Calculation of the product:**
   - The program calculates the product in reverse order, starting from the last command. This is not the correct approach as the problem requires calculating the product and outputting the remainder at each step before processing the command.

3. **Logic for updating `k`:**
   - The logic for updating `k` (the product modulo `m`) is incorrect. The program does not correctly update `k` based on the commands 'L' and 'R' in the correct order.

4. **Handling of commands:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the commands 'L' and 'R' to remove elements from the array in the correct order.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the product of the array elements modulo `m` at each step.
- Process each command in the order they appear in the string `s`.
- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command and update the product accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        
        for command in s:
            result.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m
                left += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m
                right -= 1
        
        print(*result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correctness: False**
