The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer.**
