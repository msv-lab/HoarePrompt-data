Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the product of the array elements and their remainders after each command.

Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Initialization of `k` and `q1`, `q2`:**
   The program initializes `k` based on the last command and the count of 'L' commands. This is incorrect because the product should be calculated from the full array initially, and then updated based on the commands.

2. **Loop for calculating remainders:**
   The loop iterates backwards from the end of the commands, which is not aligned with the problem statement that requires processing commands from the beginning.

3. **Updating the product:**
   The product `k` is updated incorrectly. The program does not correctly maintain the product of the remaining elements after each command.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # List to store the remainders
        remainders = []
        
        # Process each command
        for command in commands:
            remainders.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
                a.pop()
        
        # Print the remainders
        print(*remainders)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements modulo `m` is calculated.
- For each command, the current product is stored in the `remainders` list.
- The product is updated by removing the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command. The modular multiplicative inverse is used to remove an element from the product.

This corrected version should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
