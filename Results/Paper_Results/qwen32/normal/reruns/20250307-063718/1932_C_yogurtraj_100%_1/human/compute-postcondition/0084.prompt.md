Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is -1. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is updated to `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1. `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, the element at index `n - 2` set to `k`, and the element at index `n - 3` also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is updated to `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 3`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is updated to `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, the element at index `n - 2` set to `k`, the element at index `n - 3` also set to `k`, and the element at index `n - 4` (which is `i`) now set to `k`, `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `(k * a[q1]) % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
