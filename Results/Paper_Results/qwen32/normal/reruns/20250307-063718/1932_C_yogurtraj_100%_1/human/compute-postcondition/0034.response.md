Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`, `q1` is -1, -3, or -2, and `q2` is 2, 0, or 1. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is updated to 3, 1, or 2. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is updated to -2, -4, or -3.**

In natural language: The value at index `i` in the list `y` is updated to `k`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
