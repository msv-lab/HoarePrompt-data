Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `(k * a[q2]) % m`, `q2` is `l + 3` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`, `q1` is `l - 1` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
