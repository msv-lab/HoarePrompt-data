The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial values of `t` and `ii` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
