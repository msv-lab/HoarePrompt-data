Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly process the commands and calculate the remainders as described in the problem statement. Here are some issues:

1. The program incorrectly initializes `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the count of 'L' commands and the last command, which is not the correct approach to calculate the product of the array elements as commands are processed.

2. The program uses a backward approach to calculate the remainders, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem requirements. The problem requires processing commands from left to right and calculating the remainder after each command.

3. The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array based on the command ('L' or 'R').

A correct approach would be to maintain the product of the current array elements, update it according to the command, and output the remainder after each command. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of the array
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        results = []
        left_index = 0
        right_index = n - 1
        
        for command in commands:
            results.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left_index], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
                left_index += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right_index], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
                right_index -= 1
        
        print(*results)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements in the array is calculated.
- For each command, the product is updated by removing the element at the appropriate end of the array (using modular multiplicative inverse to handle division under modulo).
- The result for each command is stored and printed at the end.
