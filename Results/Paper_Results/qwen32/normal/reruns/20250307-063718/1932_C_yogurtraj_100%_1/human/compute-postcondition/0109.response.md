The code snippet provided is `q1 -= 1`, which means the value of `q1` is decreased by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the new input string
- `ii` is 2
- `n` must be at least 1
- `m` is the second integer from the new input
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`
- `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`
- `i` is -1
- `q2` is `l`
- The last character of `t` is not 'R'
- If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `((a[l - 1] % m) * a[l - 2]) % m` and `q1` is `l - 2`, otherwise `k` is `((a[l] % m) * a[l - 1]) % m` and `q1` is `l - 1`

The only variable that changes is `q1`, which is decreased by 1.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k`, `i` is -1, `q2` is `l`, `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**
