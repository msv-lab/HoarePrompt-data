Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is the last element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -2, and `q2` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the first element of `a` modulo `m`, `q1` is -1, and `q2` is 1.**
