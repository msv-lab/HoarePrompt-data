Output State: **`t` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer, `l` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to `k` and the element at index `i` also set to `k`, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is -2, -4, or -3, and `q2` is 2, 0, or 1.**

Explanation: The value of `q1` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `q1` was -1, it becomes -2; if `q1` was -3, it becomes -4; and if `q1` was -2, it becomes -3. All other variables remain unchanged.
