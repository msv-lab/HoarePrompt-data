Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is a string representing the first integer from the input.
   - However, `t` is not used directly in the calculation of `y`.

2. **Variable `ii`**: It is initialized to 0 and not used further in the provided context.

3. **Variables `n` and `m`**: 
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.
   - These are used to determine the size of the list `y`.

4. **Variable `a`**: 
   - It is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next line of input and converting each part to an integer.
   - This list is not used in the calculation of `y`.

5. **Variable `l`**: 
   - It is initialized to 0 and not used further in the provided context.

6. **Variable `y`**:
   - It is a list of `n` zeros.
   - The last element of `y` is set to `k`.
   - The element at index `i` is set to `k` for all `i` from `n-2` to `0`.
   - However, `k` is not defined in the given context. Since `k` is not defined and no iterations or changes to `k` are described, we can assume `k` is not set to any value other than 0. Therefore, `y` will be a list of `n` zeros.

7. **Variable `i`**: 
   - It is initialized to -1 and not used further in the provided context.

8. **Variable `k`**: 
   - It is the final value of `k` after all iterations, but since no iterations or changes to `k` are described, we assume `k` remains 0.

9. **Variables `q1` and `q2`**:
   - `q1` is -1 minus the number of 'L' characters in `t` from index `n-2` to `0`.
   - `q2` is 1 plus the number of 'R' characters in `t` from index `n-2` to `0`.
   - These variables are not used in the calculation of `y`.

Given this information, the list `y` is a list of `n` zeros because no changes to `y` are described other than its initial definition. Therefore, when the `print(*y)` statement is executed, it will print `n` zeros.

Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (n zeros)**

To make it more precise and adhere to the format:

Output: **0 (repeated n times)**
