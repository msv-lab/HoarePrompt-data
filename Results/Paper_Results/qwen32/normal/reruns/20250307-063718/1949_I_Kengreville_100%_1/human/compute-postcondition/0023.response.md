Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True`, `coef[i]` is set to `1`, `tot` is updated based on the edges where `x[node] == y[neighbor]`, `bipartite` remains `True`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, or `ok`.**
