The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it is `i`), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was the index used in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, since we do not know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**

But to adhere strictly to the format and the requirement to only adjust the objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
