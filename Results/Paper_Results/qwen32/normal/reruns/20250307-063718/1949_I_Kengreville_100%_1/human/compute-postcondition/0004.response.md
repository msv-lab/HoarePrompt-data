The code snippet `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of `False` values of length `n`. This means that the previous values in `visited` are discarded, and all elements in the new `visited` list are `False`. The values of other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**
