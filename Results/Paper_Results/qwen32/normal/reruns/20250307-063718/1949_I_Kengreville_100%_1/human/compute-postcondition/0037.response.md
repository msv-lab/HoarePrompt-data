Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[2]` is `False` initially, then `visited[2]` becomes `True`, `coef[2]` becomes 2, `bipartite` becomes `False`, `ok` becomes `True`, and `tot` becomes 1. Otherwise, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `bipartite`, `ok`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
