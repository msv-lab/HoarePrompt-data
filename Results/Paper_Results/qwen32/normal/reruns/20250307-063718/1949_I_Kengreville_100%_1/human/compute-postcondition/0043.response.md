Postcondition: **`visited` is a list of `True` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values of length `n`, `tot` is the combined total from all `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if all components are bipartite, and `ok` is `True` if any component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`. If `ok` is `True`, then at least one component is bipartite with a non-zero `tot`. If `ok` is `False`, then no component is bipartite or all bipartite components have a zero `tot`.**
