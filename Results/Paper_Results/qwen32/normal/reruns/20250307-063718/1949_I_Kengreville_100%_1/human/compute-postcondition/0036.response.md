Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited[1]` is `True`, `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef[1]` is 1, `coef[2]` is 2, `bipartite` is `False`, `ok` is `True`, `tot` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `ok` is not changed because the expression `ok or bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `True` given that `ok` is already `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.
