Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which were read from the input in groups of three. The `visited` list will remain as a list of `False` values of length `n`, and the `coef` list will remain unchanged as a list of `None` values of length `n`.
