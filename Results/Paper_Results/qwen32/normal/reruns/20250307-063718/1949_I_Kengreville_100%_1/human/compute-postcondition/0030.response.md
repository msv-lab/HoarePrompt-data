Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially `False`, then `visited[1]` is now `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `bipartite` remains `True`, `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`, and `tot` is 0. If `visited[1]` was initially `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, or `ok`.**
