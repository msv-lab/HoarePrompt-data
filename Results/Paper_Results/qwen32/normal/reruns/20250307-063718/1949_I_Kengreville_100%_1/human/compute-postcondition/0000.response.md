The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. This means the initial value of `n` (which was an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000) is replaced by the new integer value provided by the input. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]`, `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= `x[i]`, `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, `n`-1]. `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n` initialized to `False` and `None` respectively.**
