The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. This means that the `i`-th elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will now hold the values read from the input, while the other elements of these lists and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`**.
