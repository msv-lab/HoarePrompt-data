The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and we don't have any information about its exact value other than it being greater than the current `i`, we can say `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
