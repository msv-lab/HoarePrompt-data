Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `coef[1]` is 1, `bipartite` remains `True`, `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`, `tot` is 0.**

In this output state, `tot` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
