Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

In natural language: The value of `coef[i]` has been changed to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
