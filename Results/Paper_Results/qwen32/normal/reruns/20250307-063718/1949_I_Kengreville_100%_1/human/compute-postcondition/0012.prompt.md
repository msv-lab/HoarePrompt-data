Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the values of three integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the values from the input split into three integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
