The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented before the code snippet is executed. The value of `n` must be greater than 0, and this condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the values of three integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` has been incremented, and `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` now hold the values of the three integers provided in the input.
