The code snippet reassigns the list `r` to be a list of `None` values of length `n`. This means that any previous values in `r` are discarded, and `r` becomes a new list filled with `None` values. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**
