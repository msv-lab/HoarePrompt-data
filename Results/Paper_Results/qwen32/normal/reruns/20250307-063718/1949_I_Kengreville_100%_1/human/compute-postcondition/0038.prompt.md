Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True`, `coef[i]` is set to `1`, `tot` is updated based on the edges where `x[node] == y[neighbor]`, `bipartite` remains `True`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, or `ok`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[1]` was initially `False`, then `visited[1]` is now `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `bipartite` remains `True`, `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`, and `tot` is 0. If `visited[1]` was initially `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, or `ok`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[2]` is `False` initially, then `visited[2]` becomes `True`, `coef[2]` becomes 2, `bipartite` becomes `False`, `ok` becomes `True`, and `tot` becomes 1. Otherwise, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `bipartite`, `ok`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
