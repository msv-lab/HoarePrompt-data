Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n`. Each triplet `(x[i], y[i], r[i])` represents the center coordinates and radius of the i-th disk. The function also accepts two lists `visited` and `coef` of length `n`, initialized to `False` and `None` respectively. The function returns a value based on the given disks and their properties, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
