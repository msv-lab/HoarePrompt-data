The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from the input. Each triplet `(x[i], y[i], r[i])` represents the center coordinates and radius of the i-th disk. The function checks if the disks can be partitioned into two groups such that no two disks in the same group intersect. If such a partition exists and at least one disk is present, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
