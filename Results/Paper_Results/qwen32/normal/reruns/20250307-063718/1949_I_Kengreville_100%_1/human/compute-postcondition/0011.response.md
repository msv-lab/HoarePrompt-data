The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. The values of `n` and `i` are not changed by this code snippet other than the precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` still holds true.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the values from the input split into three integers.**
