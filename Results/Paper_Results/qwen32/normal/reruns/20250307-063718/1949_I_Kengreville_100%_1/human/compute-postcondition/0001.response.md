The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list of length `n`, where each element is `None`. The previous contents of `x` (which were lists of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks) are replaced. The values of `n`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers, `r` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**
