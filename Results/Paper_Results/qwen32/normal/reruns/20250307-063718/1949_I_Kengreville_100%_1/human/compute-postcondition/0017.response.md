Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except `visited[i]` which is `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. The current value of `visited[i]` is `False`.**
