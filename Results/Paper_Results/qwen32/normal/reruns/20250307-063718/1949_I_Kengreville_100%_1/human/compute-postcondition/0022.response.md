Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True` and potentially other `True` values depending on the graph structure, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1`, `tot` is updated based on the edges where `x[node] == y[neighbor]`, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated based on the logical expression `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given that `bipartite` is `True`, the value of `ok` will be `True` if `tot` is not equal to 0. If `tot` is 0, `ok` remains `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
