Postcondition: **`visited` is a list of `True` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values of length `n`, `tot` is the combined total from all `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if all components are bipartite, `ok` is `True` if any component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`. The current value of `ok` is `True`.**
