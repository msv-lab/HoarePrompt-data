Precondition: **i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited. coef is a list of integers used to assign coefficients for bipartite checking. bipartite is a boolean variable indicating whether the graph formed by the disks is bipartite. tot is a variable used to accumulate the total based on the coefficients.**
