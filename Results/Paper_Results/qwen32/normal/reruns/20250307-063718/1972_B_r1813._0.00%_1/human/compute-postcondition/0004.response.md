Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data`.**

In this output state, the `index` variable has been incremented by 1, while the `data` list and the value of `t` remain unchanged.
