### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins remains invariant modulo 2 throughout the game, assuming optimal play by both players. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even, and vice versa. Therefore, the game's outcome is solely determined by the initial parity of the number of facing-up coins.

The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, counts the number of "U" characters in the string representing the coins for each test case, and appends "YES" to the results list if the count is odd, or "NO" if the count is even. This logic correctly implements the solution to the problem.
