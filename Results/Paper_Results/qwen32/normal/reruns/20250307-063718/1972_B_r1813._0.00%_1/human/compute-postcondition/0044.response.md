Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` representing coins facing up ("U") or down ("D"). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd and outputs "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.**
