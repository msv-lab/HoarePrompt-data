The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified or affected by this operation. Therefore, the `results` list will now contain one element, which is the string `'YES'`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 3; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`; `n` is an integer equal to the second element in `data`; `s` is the string at `data[2]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s` and `num_up_coins` is odd.**
