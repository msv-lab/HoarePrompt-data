The code snippet provided only reads input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. It does not process or alter any other variables or perform any calculations. Therefore, the only change in the state is that the variable `input` now holds the entire content of the standard input.

Output State: **The function `func_1` receives input through standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `input` is assigned the entire content of the standard input.**
