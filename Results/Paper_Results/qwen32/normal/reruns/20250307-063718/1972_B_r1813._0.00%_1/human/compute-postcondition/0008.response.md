Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 2; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an integer equal to the second element in `data`.**

In natural language: The `index` variable has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
