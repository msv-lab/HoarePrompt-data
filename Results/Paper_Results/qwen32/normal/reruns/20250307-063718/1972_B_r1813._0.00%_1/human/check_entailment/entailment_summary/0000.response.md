Reasoning:  
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The game's rules and the provided example suggest that Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in each test case's string and checking if the count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating Alice's win; otherwise, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob's win. This matches the rules and the example given in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
