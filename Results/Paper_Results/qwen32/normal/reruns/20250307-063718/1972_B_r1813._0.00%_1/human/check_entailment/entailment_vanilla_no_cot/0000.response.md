To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented matches the rules and requirements of the problem described.

The key observation in the problem is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Specifically:
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.

The provided program reads the input, counts the number of 'U's in the string for each test case, and then checks if this count is odd or even. Based on this check, it appends either "YES" or "NO" to the results list, which is then printed.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It extracts the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins for each test case.
   - It counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It checks if the count of 'U's is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it appends "YES" to the results list, indicating Alice's win.
   - If the count is even, it appends "NO" to the results list, indicating Bob's win.
3. **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.

The logic implemented in the program correctly reflects the game's rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
