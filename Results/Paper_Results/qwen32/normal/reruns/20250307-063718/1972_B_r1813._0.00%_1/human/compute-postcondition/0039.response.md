To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and understand the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`data`**: A list of strings where:
   - The first element is `t` (the number of test cases).
   - The subsequent elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case.

2. **`index`**: Calculated as `2 * t + 1` where `t` is the number of test cases.

3. **`t`**: An integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0.

4. **`results`**: A list containing at least two elements.

### Key Points to Note:
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined or assigned a value in the given initial state.
- The `print(result)` statement will throw a `NameError` because `result` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
Given that the variable `result` is not defined in the provided initial state, attempting to print it will result in a `NameError`. However, since the task is to describe what will be printed based on the given information, and there is no `result` variable, we can infer that there might be a typo or an assumption that `result` is intended to be `results`.

Assuming the intention was to print the `results` list, the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

### Output:
If `result` was meant to be `results`, the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing at least two elements)**

However, based on the exact given information:

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
