The code snippet appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 7; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, with an additional `'NO'` appended; `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[5]`; `s` is the string at `data[6]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`.
