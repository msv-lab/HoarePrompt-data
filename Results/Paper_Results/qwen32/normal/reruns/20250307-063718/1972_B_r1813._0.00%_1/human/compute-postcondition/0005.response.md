The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state of `data`, `index`, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.**
