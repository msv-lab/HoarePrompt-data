Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    num_up_coins = s.count('U')
    if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 3; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even; `n` is an integer equal to the second element in `data`; `s` is the string at `data[2]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 7; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, with an additional `'YES'` appended if `num_up_coins` is odd, or an additional `'NO'` appended if `num_up_coins` is even; `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[5]`; `s` is the string at `data[6]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is 9; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, with an additional `'YES'` appended if `num_up_coins` is odd, or an additional `'NO'` appended if `num_up_coins` is even; `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[7]`; `s` is the string at `data[8]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, an additional `'YES'` is appended to `results`. If `num_up_coins` is even, an additional `'NO'` is appended to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
