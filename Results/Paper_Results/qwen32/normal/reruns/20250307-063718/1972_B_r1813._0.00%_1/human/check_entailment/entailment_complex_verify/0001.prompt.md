You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1

        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` receives input through standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being either the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` representing coins facing up ("U") or down ("D"). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd and outputs "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description.

1. **Game Mechanics and Strategy**:
   - The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each either facing up ('U') or down ('D').
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its two adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem states that both players play optimally. Optimal play means that each player will make the best move available to them to maximize their chances of winning.
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize a pattern or invariant that determines the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The solution hinges on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U').
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the number of coins for each test case, and the string representing the coins.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' in the string.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count is even, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating Bob wins.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic aligns with the problem description and the optimal play strategy.
