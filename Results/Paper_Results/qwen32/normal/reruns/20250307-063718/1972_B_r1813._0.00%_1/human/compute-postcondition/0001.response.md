The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads the entire input from standard input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that the first element of `data` will be the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements will be the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, interleaved.

Given the initial state where `input` is assigned the entire content of the standard input, after executing the code, `data` will be a list containing all the input values split by whitespace.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case.**
