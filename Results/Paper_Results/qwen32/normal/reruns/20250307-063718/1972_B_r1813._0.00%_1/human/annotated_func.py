#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` receives input through standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the following elements are alternating `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D" characters) for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is an integer equal to the value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being either the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` representing coins facing up ("U") or down ("D"). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd and outputs "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.
