Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` where each character is either "U" (coin facing up) or "D" (coin facing down). For each test case, the function returns the number of times the sequence of coins changes from "U" to "D" or from "D" to "U".**
