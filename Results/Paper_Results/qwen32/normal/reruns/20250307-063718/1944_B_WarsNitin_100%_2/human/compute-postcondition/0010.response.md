Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is twice the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is now twice its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged.
