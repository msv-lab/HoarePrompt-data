The given code appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `l`. 

The initial state specifies that `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`. After executing the line `l.append(b[n - 1])`, the list `l` will definitely contain the last element of `b` as its last element. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `2*(n-1)`; `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` reaches 0; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `q` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end; `req` is `k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and `l` also contains the last element of `b`.**
