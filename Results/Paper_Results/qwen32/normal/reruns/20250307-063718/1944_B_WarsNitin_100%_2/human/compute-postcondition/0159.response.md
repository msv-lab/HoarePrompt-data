The given code snippet appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, meaning the value being appended is a duplicate of the previous element in the list `c`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1
- `q` is 1
- `n` is at least 4
- `a` is the new list of integers from the input
- `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`
- `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end
- `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each
- `k` is 0 or retains its original value if the condition is not met
- `req` is twice the second integer from the new input
- `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not at the end of the list
- `i` is `n - 2` or the value of `i` when `k` reaches 0

The only variable that changes is `ans2`, which now includes the value of `c[i]` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]`, `k` is 0 or retains its original value if the condition is not met, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not at the end of the list, `i` is `n - 2` or the value of `i` when `k` reaches 0, and `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.**
