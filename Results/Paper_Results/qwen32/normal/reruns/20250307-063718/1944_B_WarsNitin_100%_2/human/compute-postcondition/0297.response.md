To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`k`**: This variable can either be `0` or `req - len(l)`.
2. **`i`**: This variable is set based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` was initially less than `len(l)`, then `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is set to `req - initial_k - 1`.
3. **`ans1` and `ans2`**: These contain the first `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` elements of `l`.
4. **`l`**: This list contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates.
5. **`req`**: This is the initial value of `k`.

### Analysis:
- `ans1` and `ans2` both contain the first `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` elements of `l`. Since they both contain the same elements, we can focus on `ans2`.
- The number of elements in `ans2` is determined by the minimum of `req - initial_k` and `len(l)`. This means that `ans2` will have up to `len(l)` elements, but no more than `req - initial_k` elements.

### Output:
Since `ans2` contains the first `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` elements of `l`, the output will be these elements printed separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elements of ans2] (where ans2 contains the first min(req - initial_k, len(l)) elements of l)**

This description captures the precise value of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
