The code snippet `ans2 = []` reassigns `ans2` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is equal to the length of `l`.**
