Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the new element `c[2]` if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `k` is -2 if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and was 0, or -4 if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and was -2, otherwise `k` remains 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 3. If `k` was 0 and `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k` is not 0, there is no change to `k`, `ans2`, or the loop.**
