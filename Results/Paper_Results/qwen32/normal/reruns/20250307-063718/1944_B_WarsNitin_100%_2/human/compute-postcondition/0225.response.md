The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the value being appended is the same as the previous element in the list `b`. This does not affect the value of `n`, `b[i]`, or the condition related to `k`. The only change is that `ans1` now includes an additional element, which is `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`; `ans1` has `b[i]` appended to it; if `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to the state.**
