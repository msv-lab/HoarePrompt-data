The code snippet provided appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `b[n - 1]` is already the last element of `b` and `ans1` initially contains this element. After appending `b[n - 1]` to `ans1`, `ans1` will now contain the last element of `b` twice.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is twice the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k`. Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
