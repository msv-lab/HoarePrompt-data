Postcondition: **`k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is either empty or contains the element `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` or `c[i] != c[i - 1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == 0`.**
