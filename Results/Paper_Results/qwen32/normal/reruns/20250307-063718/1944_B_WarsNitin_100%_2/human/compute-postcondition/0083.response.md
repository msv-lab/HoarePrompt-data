Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1`, `k` is 0, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is 0. Since `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
