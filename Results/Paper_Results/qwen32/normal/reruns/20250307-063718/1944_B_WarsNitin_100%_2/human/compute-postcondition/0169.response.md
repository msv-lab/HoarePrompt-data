Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` and now includes `c[n - 1]` if the condition is met, `k` is `k - 2` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` or retains its original value otherwise, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not at the end of the list, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes `c[n - 1]` and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` and `k` remain unchanged.**
