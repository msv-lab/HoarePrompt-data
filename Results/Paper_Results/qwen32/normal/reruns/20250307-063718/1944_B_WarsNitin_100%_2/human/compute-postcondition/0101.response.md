To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step and understand the state of the variables and objects involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **t**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. **q**: Set to 0.
3. **n**: First integer from the input.
4. **a**: A list of integers from the input.
5. **b**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.
6. **c**: A sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.
7. **ans1**: Contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates plus all elements of `l`.
8. **ans2**: Contains pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1` plus all elements of `l`.
9. **k**: Set to 0.
10. **l**: A list that must have at least one element.
11. **i**: Set to the length of `l`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- `ans2` is constructed from pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1`, and then all elements of `l` are added.
- `k` is initialized to 0, which means the loop condition involving `k` will not allow any pairs to be added based on `k`.
- `i` is initialized to the length of `l`, which means the loop condition involving `i` will also not allow any pairs to be added based on `i` reaching `n-1`.
- `l` has at least one element, and all elements of `l` are added to `ans2`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `k` is 0 and `i` is the length of `l`, the loop conditions prevent any pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` from being added to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` will only contain the elements of `l`.

### Output:
Since `ans2` will only contain the elements of `l`, and `l` has at least one element, the output will be the elements of `l`.

Output: **[elements of l] (where l is a list that must have at least one element)**
