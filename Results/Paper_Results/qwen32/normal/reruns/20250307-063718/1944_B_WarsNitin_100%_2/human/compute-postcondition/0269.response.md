Output State: **`k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is either empty or contains the element `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `k`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `req`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged. The code execution results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
