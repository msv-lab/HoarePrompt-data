Output State: **`k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` or `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `c[i]` to `ans2`. If `ans2` was previously empty, it now contains the single element `c[i]`. If `ans2` already contained the element `c[i]` or other elements, it now contains `c[i]` in addition to those previous elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
