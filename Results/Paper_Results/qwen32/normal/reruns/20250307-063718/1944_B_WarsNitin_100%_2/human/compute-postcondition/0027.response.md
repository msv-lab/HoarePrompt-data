Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is either 0, twice the second integer from the input, or twice the second integer from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`. Additionally, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` remains an empty list. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
