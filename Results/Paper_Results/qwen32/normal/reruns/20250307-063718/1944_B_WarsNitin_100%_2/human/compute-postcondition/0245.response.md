The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` already had an additional element `b[i]` appended to it, so after executing this line, `ans1` will have one more element `b[i]` added to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, `n` remains greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans1` now has two additional elements `b[i]` appended to it.
