Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`, `k` is 0, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of all variables remain the same, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
