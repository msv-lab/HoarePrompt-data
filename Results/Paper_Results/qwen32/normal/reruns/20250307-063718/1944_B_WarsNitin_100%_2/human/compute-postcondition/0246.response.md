The code snippet `k -= 2` decrements the value of `k` by 2. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it, `k` is decreased by 2.**
