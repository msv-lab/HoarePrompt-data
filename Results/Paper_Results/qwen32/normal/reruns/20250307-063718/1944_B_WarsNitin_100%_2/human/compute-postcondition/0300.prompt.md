You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). The array a is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^4.

    #State: After all iterations, the output state will consist of the printed results of `ans1` and `ans2` for each of the `t` test cases. Each test case's results are printed on separate lines.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 50,000 and `k` is between 1 and the floor of `n/2`. It also accepts an array `a` of length `2n` that contains each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. The function returns a result based on these inputs, although the specific output details are not provided in the constraints.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
