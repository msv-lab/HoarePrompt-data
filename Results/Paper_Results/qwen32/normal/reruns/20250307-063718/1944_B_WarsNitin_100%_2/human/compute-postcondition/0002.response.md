The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` and `q` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the new values of `n` and `k`, while `t` still must be greater than or equal to 1 and `q` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
