Output State: **`k` is `0`, `i` is `0`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `k`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `req` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
