The code snippet provided is simply `ans2 = []`, which reassigns `ans2` to be an empty list. This means that any previous elements in `ans2` are discarded, and `ans2` now holds no elements.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `n-1`; `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` reaches 0; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `q` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end.**
