The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to list `ans2`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `0`, so the element at index `0` of `l` is appended to `ans2`. The other variables (`k`, `req`, `ans1`, and the structure of `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `0` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found)`, `i` is `0`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is the initial value of `k`.**
