Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`k`**: 
   - `k` is either `0` or `req - len(l)`.
   - `req` is the initial value of `k`.

2. **`i`**:
   - If `k` was initially less than `len(l)`, then `i` is `len(l) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is `req - initial_k - 1` (which simplifies to `0` since `initial_k` and `req` are the same).

3. **`ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - `ans1` and `ans2` contain the first `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` elements of `l`.
   - Since `initial_k` is the same as `req`, `req - initial_k` is `0`. Therefore, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain the first `min(0, len(l))` elements of `l`, which means they will be empty lists.

4. **`l`**:
   - `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates.
   - However, the specific elements of `l` are not provided, so we can only describe `ans1` based on the given logic.

5. **`req`**:
   - `req` is the initial value of `k`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

### Explanation:
- `ans1` is an empty list because `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` evaluates to `0`.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the elements of `ans1`. Since `ans1` is empty, nothing will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **(nothing is printed)**
