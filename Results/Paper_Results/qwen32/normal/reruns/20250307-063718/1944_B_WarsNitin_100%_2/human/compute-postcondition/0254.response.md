Output State: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the values of `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is set to `n-2` if the loop completes. The loop is exited due to the `break` statement, and `req` retains its initial value of `k`, which is 0. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 still holds.
