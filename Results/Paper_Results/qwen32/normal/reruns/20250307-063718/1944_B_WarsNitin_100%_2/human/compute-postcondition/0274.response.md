Postcondition: **`k` is `req - 2` or -4 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains `req` or -2. `i` is `n-2`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements, otherwise `ans2` remains the same. `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates. `req` is the initial value of `k`. `n` is greater than 1.**
