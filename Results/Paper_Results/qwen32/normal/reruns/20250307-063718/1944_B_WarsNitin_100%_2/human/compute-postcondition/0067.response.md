Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes `c[i]` twice and `k` is -2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains 0. `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
