The code snippet `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `l`. 

- If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` initially contains the first element of `b` and `i` is 1. After appending `b[n - 1]` to `l`, `l` will contain two elements: the first element of `b` and the element at index `n - 1` of `b`. The value of `i` remains 1, as it was not modified in the code snippet.
- If `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`, `l` is initially an empty list and `i` is 0. After appending `b[n - 1]` to `l`, `l` will contain one element: the element at index `n - 1` of `b`. The value of `i` remains 0, as it was not modified in the code snippet.

The other variables (`t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `req`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is twice the second integer from the new input, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list containing the element at index `n - 1` of `b` (and possibly the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`), `i` is 1 if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` else `i` is 0.**
