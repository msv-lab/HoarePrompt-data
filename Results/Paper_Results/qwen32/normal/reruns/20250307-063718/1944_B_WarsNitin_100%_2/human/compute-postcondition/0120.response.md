Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing `b[n - 1], b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is either twice the second integer from the new input or twice the second integer from the new input minus 2, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and possibly the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `i` is 1 if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` else `i` is 0. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, then `l` includes the element at index `n - 1` of `b` and `ans1` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ans1` contains `b[n - 1], b[n - 1]` and `k` is decreased by 2.**
