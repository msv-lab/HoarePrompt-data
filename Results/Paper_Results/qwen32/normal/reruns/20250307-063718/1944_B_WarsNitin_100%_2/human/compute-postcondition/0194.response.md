The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. This means that `ans1` will now contain one more element, which is `l[i]`. The other variables `l`, `i`, and `k` are not directly modified by this operation, although the state of `i` being `i + 1` and the condition `if k == 0` breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still relevant.

Output State: **`l` contains at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans1` now contains the additional element `l[i]`.**
