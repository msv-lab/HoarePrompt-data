The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the newly assigned value of `t` and retain the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). The array `a` is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^4.**
