The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. 

The initial state tells us that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`). Additionally, if `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, the value of `k` is not relevant to the execution of the given code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.

The only change in state is that `ans1` has an additional element, which is `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`); `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]`.**
