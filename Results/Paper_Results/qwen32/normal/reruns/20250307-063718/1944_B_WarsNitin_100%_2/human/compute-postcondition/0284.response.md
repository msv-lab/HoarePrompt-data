Output State: **`k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`; `i` is `1`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `req` is the initial value of `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
