The code appends the last element of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Since `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, the last element of `b` is the same as the second-to-last element of `b`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is twice the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is `k`. Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
