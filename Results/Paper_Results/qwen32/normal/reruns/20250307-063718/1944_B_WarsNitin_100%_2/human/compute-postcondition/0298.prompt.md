Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). The array `a` is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates plus all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1` plus all elements of `l`, `k` is 0, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` reaches 0; `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `n-1`; `ans1` and `ans2` each have `min(k_initial, n)` elements appended to them.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `0` or `req - len(l)`; `i` is `len(l) - 1` if `k` was initially less than `len(l)`, otherwise `i` is `req - initial_k - 1`; `ans1` and `ans2` contain the first `min(req - initial_k, len(l))` elements of `l`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates; `req` is the initial value of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
