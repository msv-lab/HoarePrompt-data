The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The other variables (`n`, `b[i]`, `ans1`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`; `ans1` has `b[i]` appended to it; if `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to the state; `k` is decreased by 2.**
