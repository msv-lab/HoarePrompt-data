Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each, `ans2` contains all elements from `c` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each, until `k` reaches 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated because `k` reached 0, or `n-1` if the loop terminated because `i` reached `n-1` and `k` did not reach 0, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not at the end of the list, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop terminated because `i` reached `n-1` and `k` did not reach 0, or the value of `i` when `k` reached 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` contains at least one element; `k` is `k - 1`; `ans1` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` contains at least one element; `k` is `k - 2`; `ans1` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` contains at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans1` contains the additional element `l[i]`; `ans2` now contains the additional element `l[i]`. `k` is `k - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
