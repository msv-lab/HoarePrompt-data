The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` is initially an empty list. After the execution of the code, `ans2` will contain the element `c[i]`.

The other variables (`k`, `i`, `ans1`, `l`, `req`, `n`, and the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` is not 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
