The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given that `k` is initially either `req` or -2, after the operation `k -= 2`, `k` will be `req - 2` or -4. The other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `req`, and `n`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is `req - 2` or -4, `i` is `n-2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` is greater than 1.**
