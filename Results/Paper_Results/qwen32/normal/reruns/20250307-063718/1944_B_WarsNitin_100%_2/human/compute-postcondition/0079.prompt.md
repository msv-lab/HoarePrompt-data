Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`, `k` is equal to `req`, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes `c[i]` twice and `k` is -2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains 0. `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the new element `c[2]` if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `k` is -2 if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and was 0, or -4 if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and was -2, otherwise `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 2. If `k` was 0 and `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the element at index 3 of `c` if `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, `k` is -4 if it was -2, -6 if it was -4, or -2 if it was 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 3. If `c[3]` is not equal to `c[2]`, then there is no change to `k` or `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
