The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input**.
