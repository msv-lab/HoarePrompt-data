You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` will always be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`. Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Selection of Elements:**
   - The program starts by sorting the first and second halves of the array (`b` and `c` respectively).
   - It then attempts to select elements from these sorted halves to form `ans1` and `ans2` while maintaining the XOR condition.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that by selecting pairs of identical elements from each half and appending some unique elements, it can satisfy the XOR condition. However, this is not always possible, and the program does not handle the XOR condition correctly in all scenarios.

2. **Handling of Unique Elements:**
   - The program checks for unique elements at the beginning and end of the sorted halves and appends them to `ans1` and `ans2` if they are not duplicates.
   - It then iterates through the sorted halves to find pairs of identical elements and appends them to `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - The program also attempts to balance the remaining elements using the `l` list, but this approach does not guarantee that the XOR of the selected elements will be equal.

3. **Example of Failure:**
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     4 1
     1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The program might output:
     ```
     1 2
     1 2
     ```
   - The XOR of `1 2` is `3`, but the XOR of `1 2` is also `3`, so this output is correct for this case. However, let's consider another case:
     ```
     1
     4 1
     1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
     ```
   - The program might output:
     ```
     1 2
     4 3
     ```
   - The XOR of `1 2` is `3`, but the XOR of `4 3` is `7`, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve ensuring that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal. This can be achieved by carefully selecting elements from the two halves of the array while maintaining the XOR condition.
   - One possible method is to use a greedy approach or a backtracking method to ensure that the XOR condition is satisfied.

Given these issues, the provided program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
