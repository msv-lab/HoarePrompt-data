Postcondition: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
