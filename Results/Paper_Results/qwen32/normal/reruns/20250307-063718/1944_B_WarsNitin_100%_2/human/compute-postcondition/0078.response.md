Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the element at index 3 of `c` if `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, `k` is -4 if it was -2, -6 if it was -4, or -2 if it was 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 3. If `c[3]` is not equal to `c[2]`, then there is no change to `k` or `ans2`.**
