The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was used to index into the list `l`, and both `ans1` and `ans2` had `l[i]` appended to them. Additionally, `k` was decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`l` contains at least one element; `k` is `k - 1`; `ans1` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`**
