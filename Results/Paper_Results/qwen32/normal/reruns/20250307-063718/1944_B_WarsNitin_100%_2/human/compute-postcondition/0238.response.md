The code `l.append(b[i])` adds the element at index `i` of list `b` to the end of list `l`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged unless `i` reaches `n - 1`, which is not the case here as per the precondition. The condition `if k == 0` does not affect the execution of `l.append(b[i])` directly, as this line of code is not inside any if-statement or loop that would be broken by `k == 0`. Therefore, the list `l` will have the element `b[i]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`); `l` has `b[i]` appended to it.**
