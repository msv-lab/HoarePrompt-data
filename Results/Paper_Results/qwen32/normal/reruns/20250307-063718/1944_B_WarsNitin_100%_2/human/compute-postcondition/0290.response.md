Output State: **`k` is `-2` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 2`; `i` is `2`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `k`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement we were directly inside is exited due to the `break` statement.
