The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `l[2]` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates plus the first element of `l` and `l[1]` and `l[2]`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1` plus the first element of `l` and `l[i]` and `l[2]`, `k` is -2, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is 2.** 

In simpler terms, `ans2` now includes the element at index 2 of `l` in addition to its previous contents.
