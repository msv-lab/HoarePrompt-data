The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, so the element at index `0` of `l` is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`k` is `0` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found)`, `i` is `0`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is the initial value of `k`. If `k` is `0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, `ans1` now includes the first element of `l` in addition to any elements it already contained. Other variables remain unchanged.
