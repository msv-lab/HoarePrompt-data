The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, the element at `l[1]` is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates plus the first element of `l` and `l[1]`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1` plus the first element of `l`, `k` is -1, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is 1. Since `k` is not equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is not exited.**

In simpler terms, the element at index 1 of `l` has been added to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
