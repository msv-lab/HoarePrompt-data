To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the behavior of the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`i`**: 
   - `i` is set to `n-1` if `k_initial` is less than `n`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is the index where `k` reaches 0.

2. **`k`**: 
   - `k` is set to 0 if `k_initial` is less than `n`.
   - Otherwise, `k` is set to `n-1`.

3. **`ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - Both `ans1` and `ans2` have `min(k_initial, n)` elements appended to them.

### Determining `min(k_initial, n)`:
- `min(k_initial, n)` is the smaller of the two values `k_initial` and `n`.

### Appending Elements to `ans2`:
- Given that `ans2` has `min(k_initial, n)` elements appended to it, the number of elements in `ans2` is `min(k_initial, n)`.

### The Print Statement:
- The `print(*ans2)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans2` separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
- Since the exact values of `k_initial` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `min(k_initial, n)`.
- The output will be the elements of `ans2`, which are `min(k_initial, n)` elements.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of `ans2`, which are `min(k_initial, n)` elements.

Output: **the elements of `ans2` (where `ans2` has `min(k_initial, n)` elements)**
