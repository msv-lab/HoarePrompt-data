Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the new element `c[2]`, `k` is -2 if it was 0, or -4 if it was -2, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` was initially 0, it becomes -2. If `k` was initially -2, it becomes -4. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
