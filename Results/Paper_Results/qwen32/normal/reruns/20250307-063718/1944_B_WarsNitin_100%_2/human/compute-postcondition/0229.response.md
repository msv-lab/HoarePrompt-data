The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `b` that are not `b[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` now includes `b[i]` as its last element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `k` is 0, or `k` is not 0 and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`; `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`; `l` now includes `b[i]` as its last element.**
