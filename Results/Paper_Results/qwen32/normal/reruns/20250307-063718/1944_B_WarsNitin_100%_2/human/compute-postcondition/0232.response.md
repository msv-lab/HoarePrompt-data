The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been a value such that the loop condition `1 <= i < n - 1` was satisfied. To execute one more iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided that the new value of `i` still satisfies the loop condition.

Given that `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute at least once (with `i = 1`). If the previous iteration had `i` at its maximum allowable value (`n - 2`), then the loop would not execute again. Otherwise, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now 2 if it was 1, 3 if it was 2, and so on, up to `n - 2`)**

To be more precise, if `i` was `n - 2` in the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute again. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`)**
