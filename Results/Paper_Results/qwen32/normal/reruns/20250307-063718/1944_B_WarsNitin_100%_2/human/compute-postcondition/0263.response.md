Postcondition: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == 0`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the behavior is described only for the if part where `k == 0` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. The state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition in both scenarios.
