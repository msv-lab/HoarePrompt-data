Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is a list containing `c[i]`, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`, `k` is 0, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]`, which is equal to `c[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
