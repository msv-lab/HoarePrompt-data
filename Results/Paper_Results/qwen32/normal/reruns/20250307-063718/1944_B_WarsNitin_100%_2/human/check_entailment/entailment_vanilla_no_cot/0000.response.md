Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The approach taken in the code does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Unique and Duplicate Elements:**
   - The code tries to handle unique and duplicate elements in `b` and `c` separately, but it does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` will be equal.
   
2. **Selection of Elements:**
   - The code does not ensure that we are selecting exactly `2k` elements from `b` and `c` such that their XOR values are equal.
   
3. **Logic for XOR Equality:**
   - The code does not have a clear strategy to ensure that the XOR of the selected `2k` elements from `b` and `c` will be equal. The logic seems to be based on the assumption that selecting certain elements from `b` and `c` will automatically result in equal XOR values, which is not guaranteed.

To correctly solve the problem, one approach could be to use the fact that since every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the array `a`, we can pair the elements and ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` will be equal. Here's a possible correct approach:

1. **Pair Elements:**
   - Pair the elements in `b` and `c` such that each integer from 1 to n is paired with its duplicate.
   
2. **Select Elements for l and r:**
   - Select `k` pairs from `b` and `k` pairs from `c` to form `l` and `r`.
   - The XOR of the elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of the elements in `r` because each integer from 1 to n will contribute equally to the XOR of `l` and `r`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        b = a[:n]
        c = a[n:]
        ans1 = []
        ans2 = []
        k = 2 * k
        # Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each number
        count_b = {}
        count_c = {}
        for num in b:
            if num in count_b:
                count_b[num] += 1
            else:
                count_b[num] = 1
        for num in c:
            if num in count_c:
                count_c[num] += 1
            else:
                count_c[num] = 1
        # Add pairs to ans1 and ans2
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            while count_b[num] > 0 and k > 0:
                ans1.append(num)
                count_b[num] -= 1
                k -= 1
            while count_c[num] > 0 and k > 0:
                ans2.append(num)
                count_c[num] -= 1
                k -= 1
        print(*ans1)
        print(*ans2)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we select `2k` elements from `b` and `c` such that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal.
