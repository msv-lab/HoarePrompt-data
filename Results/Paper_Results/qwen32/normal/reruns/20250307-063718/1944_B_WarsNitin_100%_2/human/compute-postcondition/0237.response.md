The code snippet `k -= 2` decrements the value of `k` by 2. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans1` are not directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`).
- `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` and another additional element `b[i]`.

After the code execution, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`); `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` and another additional element `b[i]`; `k` is decreased by 2.**
