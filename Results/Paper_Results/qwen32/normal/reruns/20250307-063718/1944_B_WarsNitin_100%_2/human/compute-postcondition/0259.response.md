Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the output state after executing the code.

**Initial State:**
- `k` is `req` and `k` is 0
- `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes
- `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates
- `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` twice
- `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates
- `req` is the initial value of `k`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`
- If `k` is not 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Code Snippet:**
```
k -= 2
```

**Output State Calculation:**
- Since `k` is initially 0, `k -= 2` results in `k` being `-2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` twice, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**
