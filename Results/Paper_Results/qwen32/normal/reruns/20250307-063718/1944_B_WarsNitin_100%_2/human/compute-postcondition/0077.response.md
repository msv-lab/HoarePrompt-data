The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given the initial conditions, `k` could be -2, -4, or 0. 

- If `k` was initially -2, after decrementing by 2, `k` becomes -4.
- If `k` was initially -4, after decrementing by 2, `k` becomes -6.
- If `k` was initially 0, after decrementing by 2, `k` becomes -2.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the element at index 3 of `c`, `k` is -4 if it was -2, -6 if it was -4, or -2 if it was 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 3.**
