### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by partitioning the array `a` into two parts, `b` (first half) and `c` (second half), and then selecting subsets `l` and `r` from `b` and `c` respectively, such that their bitwise XORs are equal.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read.
   - The array `a` of length `2n` is read.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted. This helps in easily identifying pairs of identical elements.

4. **Initialization:**
   - `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized as empty lists to store the elements of `l` and `r` respectively.
   - `k` is doubled to `2k` to reflect the total number of elements required in both `l` and `r`.
   - `req` is set to `k` to keep track of the original value of `k`.
   - `l` is initialized as an empty list to store unique elements from `b`.

5. **Building `l`:**
   - The first and last elements of `b` are checked for uniqueness. If they are unique, they are added to `l`.
   - If the last element is not unique, it is added twice to `ans1` and `k` is decremented by 2.
   - For the remaining elements in `b`, if an element is identical to its predecessor, it is added twice to `ans1` and `k` is decremented by 2. If an element is unique (i.e., not identical to its predecessor or successor), it is added to `l`.

6. **Building `r`:**
   - For the elements in `c`, if an element is identical to its predecessor, it is added twice to `ans2` and `k` is decremented by 2.

7. **Balancing `l` and `r`:**
   - Elements from `l` are added alternately to `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` reaches 0.

8. **Output:**
   - The elements of `ans1` and `ans2` are printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of XOR Equality:**
  - The code ensures that pairs of identical elements are added to `ans1` and `ans2` to maintain the XOR equality. This is because the XOR of an element with itself is 0, and adding the same pair to both `ans1` and `ans2` does not affect the XOR equality.
  - The unique elements in `b` are added to `l` and then distributed between `ans1` and `ans2` to maintain the XOR equality.

- **Correctness of Subset Condition:**
  - The elements added to `ans1` are a subset of `b`, and the elements added to `ans2` are a subset of `c`.
  - The code ensures that the total number of elements in `ans1` and `ans2` is `2k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles cases where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2`).
  - The code handles cases where `k` is 1 or `k` is close to `n/2`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` are formed such that their bitwise XORs are equal, and that they are subsets of the respective halves of the array `a`.

**Correctness: True**
