The code snippet `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a` remain unchanged except for the creation of `b`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**
