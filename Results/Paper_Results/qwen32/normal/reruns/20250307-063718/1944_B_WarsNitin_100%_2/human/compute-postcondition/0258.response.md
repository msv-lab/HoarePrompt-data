The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` adds the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` already contains the element `c[i]`, and since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, appending `c[i]` again will result in `ans2` having `c[i]` twice.

Output State: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` twice, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` is not 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
