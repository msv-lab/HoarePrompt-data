The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing `b[n - 1], b[n - 1]`. After the append operation, `ans1` will contain one additional element, specifically `b[i]`.

Let's break down the output state:
- `t` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `q` is still 1.
- `n` is still at least 2.
- `a` is still the new list of integers from the input.
- `b` is still the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`.
- `c` is still the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end.
- `ans1` now contains `b[i]` appended to its previous contents.
- `ans2` is still an empty list.
- `k` is still either 0 or twice the second integer from the new input minus 2.
- `req` is still twice the second integer from the new input.
- `l` is still a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and possibly the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`.
- `i` is still 1 if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` else `i` is 0.
- `b[i]` is still equal to `b[i - 1]` if `i` is not 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i]]` or `[b[i]]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the new input minus 2, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and possibly the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `i` is 1 if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` else `i` is 0, and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` if `i` is not 0.**
