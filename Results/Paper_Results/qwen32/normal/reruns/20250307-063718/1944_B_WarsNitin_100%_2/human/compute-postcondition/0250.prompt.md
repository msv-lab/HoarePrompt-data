Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first input integer, `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `2*(n-1)` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, or `k` is `-2` if `k_initial` < `n` otherwise `2*(n-1) - 2` if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`. `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise it is the index where `k` reaches 0. `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, or it contains the `n`-th largest element of the first `n` elements of `a` twice if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`. `ans2` is an empty list in both cases. `q` is `t`. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`. `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end. `req` is `k`. `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has `b[i]` appended to it and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`). If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements, both being `b[i]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `l` has `b[i]` appended to it. If `b[i] == b[i + 1]`, no changes are made to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` has an additional element `b[i]`. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
