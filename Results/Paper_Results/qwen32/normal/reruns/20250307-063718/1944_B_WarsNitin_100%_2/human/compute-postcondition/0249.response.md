Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` has an additional element `b[i]`. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
