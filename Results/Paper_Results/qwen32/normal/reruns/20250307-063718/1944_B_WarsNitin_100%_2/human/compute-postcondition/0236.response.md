The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` adds the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` already has an additional element `b[i]`, so after executing the code, `ans1` will have one more element `b[i]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` must be less than `n - 1`); `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` and another additional element `b[i]`.**
