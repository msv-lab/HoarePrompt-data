The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`.

Given the conditions in the problem, the state of `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `req` does not change based on the loop head variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
