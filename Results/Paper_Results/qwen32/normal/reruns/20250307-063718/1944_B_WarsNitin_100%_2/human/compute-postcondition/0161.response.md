Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that are part of consecutive duplicates, added twice each, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` and now includes `c[i]` again, `k` is `k - 2` or retains its original value if the condition is not met, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not at the end of the list, `i` is `n - 2` or the value of `i` when `k` reaches 0, and `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is decreased by 2, while all other variables retain their original values and states.
