Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` and now also includes `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` or `c[i] != c[i - 1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == 0`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now -2. All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `req`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions that define the behavior of the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and the loop or if statement remain the same.
