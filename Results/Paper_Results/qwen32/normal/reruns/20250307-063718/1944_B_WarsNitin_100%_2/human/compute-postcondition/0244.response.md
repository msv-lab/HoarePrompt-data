The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` as per the initial state, but this does not affect the current operation of appending `b[i]` to `ans1`.

The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is `i + 1`. The condition about `k` being equal to 0 leading to a break does not affect the current operation since there's no loop or if-statement being executed in the provided code snippet.

Since `i` is `i + 1`, the element at index `i` in `b` will be appended to `ans1`. The updated state will reflect that `ans1` now includes this new element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it.**
