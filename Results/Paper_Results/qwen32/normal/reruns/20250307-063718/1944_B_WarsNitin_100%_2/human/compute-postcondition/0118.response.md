The code snippet `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `ans1` initially contains `b[n - 1]`, this operation will add a duplicate of `b[n - 1]` to `ans1`. 

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing `b[n - 1], b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is twice the second integer from the new input, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and `i` is equal to the length of `l` (which is 1). Otherwise, `l` is an empty list and `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans1` now contains two identical elements, both being `b[n - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
