The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is within, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n` and `i`. Therefore, the value of `n` remains greater than 2, and the value of `i` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
