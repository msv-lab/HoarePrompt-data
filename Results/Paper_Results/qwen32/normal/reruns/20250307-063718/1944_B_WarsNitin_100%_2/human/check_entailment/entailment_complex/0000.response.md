### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by dividing the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, sorting them, and then constructing the arrays `ans1` and `ans2` such that their XOR values are equal and each array contains `2k` elements.

However, the current implementation does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` will be equal to the XOR of the elements in `ans2`. The logic used in the program is not robust enough to ensure the required condition.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Sorting and Selection**: The program sorts the first half `b` and the second half `c` of the array. It then attempts to select elements based on whether they are repeated or not. However, this does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `ans1` will match the XOR of the selected elements in `ans2`.

2. **Handling Repeated Elements**: The program handles repeated elements by adding them to `ans1` and `ans2` in pairs. This approach might work in some cases but does not guarantee the desired XOR equality.

3. **Ensuring XOR Equality**: The program does not explicitly ensure that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` are equal. It simply appends elements based on certain conditions, which does not guarantee the required condition.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k` is large or when the array has specific patterns.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are equal, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal. A correct implementation would need to ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are indeed equal, which the current program does not do.
