The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, with additional elements if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`. After appending `b[i]` to `ans1`, `ans1` will now include this new element.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list that includes the elements it previously had plus `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`, `k` is updated based on the conditions involving `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`, `l` is constructed based on the conditions involving `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, `b[n - 2]`, and `b[n - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1` and `i + 1` is less than `n-1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

In simpler terms: `ans1` now includes the element at index `i` of `b`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
