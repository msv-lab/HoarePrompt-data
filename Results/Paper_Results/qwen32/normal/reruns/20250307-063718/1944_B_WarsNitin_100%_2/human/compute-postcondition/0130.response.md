Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing `b[n - 1], b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the new input minus 2, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and possibly the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `i` is 1 if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` else `i` is 0, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
