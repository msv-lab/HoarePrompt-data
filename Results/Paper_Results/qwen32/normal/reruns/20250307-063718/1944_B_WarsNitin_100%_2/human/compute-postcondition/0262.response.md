The value of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.

Output State: **`k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
