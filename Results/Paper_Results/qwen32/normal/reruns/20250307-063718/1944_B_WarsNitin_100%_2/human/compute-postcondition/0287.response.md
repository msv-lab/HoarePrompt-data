The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to list `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially `1`, the element at index `1` of `l` is added to `ans2`.

Output State: **`k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`; `i` is `1`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `req` is the initial value of `k`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes occur.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `1` of `l` has been added to `ans2`. Other variables remain unchanged.
