Postcondition: **`k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is either empty or contains the element `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
