Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `0` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found)`, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`, `i` is `0`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is the initial value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is `-2` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 2`; `i` is `1`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `-3` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 3`; `i` is `2`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]` plus `l[2]`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]` plus `l[2]`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
