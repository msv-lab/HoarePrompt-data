The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `k` is either `0` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found)`. After the decrement, `k` will be `-1` if it was `0`, or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1` if it was `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`, `i` is `0`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is the initial value of `k`.**
