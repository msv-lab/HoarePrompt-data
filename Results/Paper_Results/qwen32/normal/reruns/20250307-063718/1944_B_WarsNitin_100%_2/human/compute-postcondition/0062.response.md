The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the current value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since it is given that the current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, this means that `ans2` will now include this duplicate value.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans1`, `req`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `ans2`, which now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is a list containing `c[i]` and now also includes `c[i]` again (i.e., `c[i]` is a duplicate), `req` is either `k` or `k-2`, `k` is 0, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates.**
