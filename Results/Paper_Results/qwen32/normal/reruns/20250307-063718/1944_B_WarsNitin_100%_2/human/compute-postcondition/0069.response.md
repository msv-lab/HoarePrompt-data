The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `c` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates, `ans2` includes the element at index 2 of `c` and the new element `c[2]`, `k` is 0 or -2 depending on previous conditions, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element and not part of consecutive duplicates, `i` is 2. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The element at index 2 of list `c` has been appended to list `ans2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
