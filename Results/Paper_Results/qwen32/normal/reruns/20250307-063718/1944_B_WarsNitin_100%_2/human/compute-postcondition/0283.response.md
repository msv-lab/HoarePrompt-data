To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. 

Given:
- `k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`
- `i` is `0`
- `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`
- `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`
- `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element
- `req` is the initial value of `k`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `0`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1` because the loop iterates over the range of the length of `l`.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to increment `i` by `1`. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`k` is `-1` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 1`, `i` is `1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `req` is the initial value of `k`**
