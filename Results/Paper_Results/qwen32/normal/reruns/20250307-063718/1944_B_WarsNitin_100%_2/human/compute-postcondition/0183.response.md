Output State: **`l` contains at least one element; `k` is 0 or not 0 (unchanged); `ans1` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The list `l` still contains at least one element, and `k` remains unchanged (it is either 0 or not 0). The list `ans1` has an additional element `l[i]` appended to it, and the list `ans2` also has the element `l[i]` appended to it.
