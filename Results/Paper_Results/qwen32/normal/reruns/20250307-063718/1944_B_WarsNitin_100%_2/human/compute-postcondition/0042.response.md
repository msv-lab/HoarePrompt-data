The code snippet `l.append(b[i])` adds the element at index `i` of list `b` to the end of list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the list `l` will now include the element `b[i]` as its last element. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `req` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, and if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` also contains `b[i]` twice. `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is either `k` or `k-2`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is either -2, twice the second integer from the input minus 4, or twice the second integer from the input minus 6. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` remains either 0, twice the second integer from the input, or twice the second integer from the input minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and the element at index `n-1` of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the element at index `n-1` of `b`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is set to 2. If `k` is not 0, the state of the variables remains as described without breaking out of the loop or if statement. `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element.**
