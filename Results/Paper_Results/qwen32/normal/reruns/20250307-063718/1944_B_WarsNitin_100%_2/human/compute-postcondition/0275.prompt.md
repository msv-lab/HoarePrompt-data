Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `req`, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is `req` and `k` is 0, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` is either empty or contains the element `c[i]`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` or `c[i] != c[i - 1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `req - 2` or -4 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains `req` or -2. `i` is `n-2`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements, otherwise `ans2` remains the same. `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates. `req` is the initial value of `k`. `n` is greater than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
