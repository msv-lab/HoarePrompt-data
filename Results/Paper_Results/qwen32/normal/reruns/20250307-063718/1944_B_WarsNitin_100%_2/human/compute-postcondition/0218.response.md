Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `2*(n-1)` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, or `k` is `-2` if `k_initial` < `n` otherwise `2*(n-1) - 2` if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`. `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise it is the index where `k` reaches 0. `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, or it contains the `n`-th largest element of the first `n` elements of `a` twice if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`. `ans2` is an empty list in both cases. `q` is `t`. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`. `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end. `req` is `k`. `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`.**
