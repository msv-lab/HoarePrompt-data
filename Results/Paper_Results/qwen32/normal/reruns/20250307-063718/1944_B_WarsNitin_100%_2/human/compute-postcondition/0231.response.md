Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has `b[i]` appended to it and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element.**
