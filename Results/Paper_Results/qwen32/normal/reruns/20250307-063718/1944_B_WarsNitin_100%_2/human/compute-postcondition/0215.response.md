The code snippet appends the last element of the sorted list `b` to the list `ans1`. The value of `b[n - 1]` is the `n`-th largest element in the first `n` elements of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is 0 if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `k` is `2*(n-1)`; `i` is `n-1` if `k_initial` < `n`, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` reaches 0; `ans1` is a list containing the `n`-th largest element of the first `n` elements of `a`; `ans2` is an empty list; `q` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end; `req` is `k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list.**
