Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` includes the last element of `b` twice and also includes `b[i]`, otherwise `ans1` remains either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice. `ans2` is an empty list. `req` is either `k` or `k-2`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is updated to `req - 2` if it was initially `req`, or `k` remains `req` if it was initially `req + 2`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` remains either 0, twice the second integer from the input, or twice the second integer from the input minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and the element at index `n-1` of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the element at index `n-1` of `b`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list. If `k` is 0, `i` is set to 2, otherwise the state of the variables remains as described without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
