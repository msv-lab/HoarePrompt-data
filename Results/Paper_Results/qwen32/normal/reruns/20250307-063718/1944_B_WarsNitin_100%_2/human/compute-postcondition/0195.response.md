Output State: **`l` contains at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans1` contains the additional element `l[i]`; `ans2` now contains the additional element `l[i]`.**

Natural Language: The list `ans2` now includes the element `l[i]` that was also added to `ans1`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
