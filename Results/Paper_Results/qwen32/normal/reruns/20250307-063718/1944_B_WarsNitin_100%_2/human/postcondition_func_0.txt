The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. It then outputs two arrays, `ans1` and `ans2`, such that each array contains `k` distinct integers from the original array `a`. The integers in `ans1` and `ans2` are chosen in a specific manner based on the sorted halves of `a`.
