The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is `2`, the element at index `2` of `l` is added to `ans2`.

Output State: **`k` is `-2` or `req - 2*(number of consecutive duplicates found) - 2`; `i` is `2`; `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]` plus `l[2]`; `ans2` contains all elements that have consecutive duplicates in `c` plus the element at index `0` of `l` plus `l[1]` plus `l[2]`; `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates and must have at least 1 element`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The element at index `2` of `l` has been appended to `ans2`. The values of `k`, `i`, `ans1`, and `l` remain the same. If `k` equals `0`, the most internal loop or if statement is still broken out of.
