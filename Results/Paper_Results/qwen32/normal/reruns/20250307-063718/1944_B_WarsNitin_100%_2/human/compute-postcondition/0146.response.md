The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `b[3]` is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` elements of the new `a`, `c` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and possibly the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is now `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i], b[i], b[i]]`, `[b[i], b[i], b[i], b[i]]`, or `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]`, and `k` is either -4, -2, 0, or twice the second integer from the new input minus 4 or 2. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]`, `[b[i], b[i]]`, or `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, and `k` is either -2, 0, or twice the second integer from the new input minus 2 or 4. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` also includes `b[i]`. `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, and `ans1` now includes `b[3]`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
