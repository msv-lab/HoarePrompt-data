To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - If `k_initial < n`, then `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is set to the index where `k` reaches 0.

2. **Variable `k`**:
   - If `k_initial < n`, then `k` is set to 0.
   - Otherwise, `k` is set to `n-1`.

3. **Lists `ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - Both `ans1` and `ans2` have `min(k_initial, n)` elements appended to them.

Given the above rules, we need to determine the contents of `ans1` and `ans2`. However, the exact elements being appended to `ans1` and `ans2` are not specified in the initial state. We only know the number of elements appended to them, which is `min(k_initial, n)`.

Since we are only asked to print `ans1`, the output will be the elements of `ans1` separated by spaces. The exact elements are not provided, so we can only describe the number of elements in `ans1`.

### Conclusion:
- The output will be the elements of `ans1`, which has `min(k_initial, n)` elements.
- Since the specific elements are not known, we can only describe the output in terms of the number of elements.

Output: **the elements of ans1 (where ans1 has min(k_initial, n) elements)**
