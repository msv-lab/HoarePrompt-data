The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` either contains the element `c[i]` or `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements. After executing the code, `ans2` will definitely contain the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements.

Output State: **`k` is `req` or `k` is -2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that have duplicates, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` in addition to its previous elements, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not at the start or end of consecutive duplicates, `req` is the initial value of `k`, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
