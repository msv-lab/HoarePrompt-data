The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. If `n` is equal to `k`, it also prints the number of purchases (1) and the number of coins used (`n`). If `n` is greater than `k` and a specific condition is met (`k - 1 < n - k + 1`), it prints the number of purchases (2) and the distribution of coins used (`n - k + 1` and `1`).
