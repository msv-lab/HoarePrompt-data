The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are two positive integers read from the input, and `n` is equal to `k`. The condition `n` is greater than or equal to `k` is always satisfied because `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k`. The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, it will always print `'YES'` regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
