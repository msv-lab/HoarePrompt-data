You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) such test cases.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is the value of n, and n is equal to k)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1)
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases. `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
        #State: `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases. `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k`, and `k - 1` is either less than `n - k + 1` or not less than `n - k + 1`.
    #State: `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases. If `n` is less than `k`, no additional changes are made. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is equal to `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k`, and `k - 1` is either less than `n - k + 1` or not less than `n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the purchase is possible or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
