Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases. `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
