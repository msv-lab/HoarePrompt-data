You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of setting up more than two stalls and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels across the stalls.

Let's analyze the code and see where it falls short:

1. **Handling the case when `n < k`:** This is correctly handled as Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
2. **Handling the case when `n == k`:** This is also correctly handled. Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if each jewel costs `n` coins.
3. **Handling the case when `n > k`:** The logic provided is insufficient. The current approach only considers two stalls, which is not enough to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

The program does not provide a general solution for setting up any number of stalls (up to 60) and setting prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here are a few examples where the current program fails:

- **Example 1:** `n = 100, k = 10`
  - The program will output `NO` because it does not consider setting up more than two stalls. However, it is possible to set up 10 stalls with prices `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]` so that Alice buys exactly 10 jewels.

- **Example 2:** `n = 1000, k = 100`
  - The program will output `NO` again. However, it is possible to set up 100 stalls with prices `[10, 10, 10, ..., 10]` (100 times) so that Alice buys exactly 100 jewels.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob can set up stalls in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary representation to distribute the number of jewels across stalls. For example, if `k = 8`, Bob can set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` and Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels.

Given these examples, the current program is not sufficient to handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
