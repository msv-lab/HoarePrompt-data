The `print('NO')` statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `n` and `k` as long as the current value of `n` is less than `k`, which is the given precondition. The print statement is not dependent on the values of `n` and `k` but rather directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
