In the given task, the initial state describes the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, which are positive integers. However, the `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2` without referencing any of the variables `n`, `k`, or `t`. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly provided by the code itself and is not dependent on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **2**
