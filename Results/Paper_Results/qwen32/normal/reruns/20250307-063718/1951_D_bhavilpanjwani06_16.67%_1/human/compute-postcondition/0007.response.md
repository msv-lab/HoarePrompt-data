Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers and that `n` is equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, but since `n` is equal to `k`, this condition is trivially satisfied.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n)
```

Since `n` is equal to `k`, and we are not given specific values for `n` or `k`, the output will be the value of `n` (which is the same as `k`). However, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n` or `k` from the given information.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n` (which is the same as `k`).

Output: **n (where n is the value of n, and n is equal to k)**
