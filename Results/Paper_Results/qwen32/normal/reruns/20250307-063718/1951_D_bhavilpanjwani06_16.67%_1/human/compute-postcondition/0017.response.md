Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases. If `n` is less than `k`, no additional changes are made. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is equal to `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k`, and `k - 1` is either less than `n - k + 1` or not less than `n - k + 1`.**
