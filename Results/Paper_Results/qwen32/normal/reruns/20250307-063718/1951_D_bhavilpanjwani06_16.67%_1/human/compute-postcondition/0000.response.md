The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state provides that `n` and `k` are positive integers, and there are `t` such test cases. After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input for the current test case.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case, and there are `t` such test cases.**
