### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers, `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Alice wants to buy). The program's logic is to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Let's analyze the logic within `func_1()`:

1. **Condition `n < k`**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. Hence, the program correctly prints "NO".

2. **Condition `n == k`**:
   - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy, Bob can set up one stall with the price equal to `n` (or `k`), and Alice will buy exactly one jewel. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `1` and `n`.

3. **Condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**:
   - This condition is checked when `n > k` and `n != k`. The logic here is flawed. The program suggests setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. While this might work for some cases, it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios. The logic does not consider the possibility of setting up more than two stalls or distributing the prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Remaining case**:
   - If the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not met, the program prints "NO". However, this is not always correct. There could be other ways to distribute the prices across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible scenarios to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. Specifically, the logic for the case where `n > k` and `n != k` is insufficient. Therefore, the program is not always correct.
