Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the purchase is possible or not.**
