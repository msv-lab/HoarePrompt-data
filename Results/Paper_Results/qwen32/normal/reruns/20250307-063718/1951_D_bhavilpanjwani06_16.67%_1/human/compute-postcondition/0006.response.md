The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement is independent of the variables `n` and `k` as well as the number of test cases `t`. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and will be output as is.

Given that the `print` statement does not reference `n`, `k`, or `t`, the values of these variables do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
