The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k` and the number of test cases `t`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
