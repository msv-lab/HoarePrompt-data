Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are two positive integers.
- There are `t` test cases, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided for this particular test case.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (`n >= k`).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (`n != k`).
- `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` (`k - 1 < n - k + 1`).

### Print Statement:
```
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Expression `n - k + 1`:**
   - Given `n` is greater than `k` (`n > k`), `n - k` is a positive integer.
   - Adding 1 to a positive integer results in another positive integer.
   - Therefore, `n - k + 1` is a positive integer greater than 1.

2. **Expression `1`:**
   - This is a constant value 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by the value 1.

### Final Answer:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1)**
