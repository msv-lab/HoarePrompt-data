Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It checks if there are at least `n` occurrences of sets of `k` consecutive characters in `s` that are all within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such occurrences are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it constructs and prints a string of length `n` by appending characters from the sets found, a character from the set of the first `k` alphabets that was not in any set, and padding with 'a' characters if necessary.**
