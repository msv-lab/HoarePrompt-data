The code snippet `ans.append(i)` appends the character `i` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, and `win` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The only change is that `ans` now includes the character `i` at the end of its list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one, and `win` includes the character `i`. `ans` includes the character `i` appended to it.**
