Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; s is the input string; us is a set containing the first k lowercase letters of the alphabet; win is an empty set; ans is a list containing the last character of each set of k consecutive characters from s that are all in us; ps is a list containing the number of times a complete set of k characters from us was found in s, and ps is less than n
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each set of `k` consecutive characters from `s` that are all in `us`; `ps` is a list containing the number of times a complete set of `k` characters from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`; `i` is in `win`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`, and `i` remain as per their initial definitions. If `i` is not in `win`, the program returns a string that is the concatenation of the elements in `ans`, the next element `i` in `us` that is not in `win`, and a string of 'a' characters such that the total length of the output string is `n`. If `i` is in `win`, no output is produced and the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`, and `i` remain as per their initial definitions except `i` is the next element in `us` that has not yet been used. If `i` is not in `win`, the function returns a string formed by concatenating the elements of `ans`, the element `i` from `us`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` number of 'a' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
