Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `win` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`; `ans` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`.**

In simpler terms, the character `i` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
