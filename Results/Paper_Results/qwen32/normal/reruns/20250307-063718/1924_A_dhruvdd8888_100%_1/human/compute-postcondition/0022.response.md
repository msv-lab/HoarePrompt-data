The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the current character being processed from the string `s`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to move to the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet
- `i` is the next character in the string `s`
- `win` is a set (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic)
- `ans` is a list (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic)
- `ps` is an integer (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic)

The variable `i` is the character currently being processed, and for the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one, `win` is a set (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic), `ans` is a list (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic), `ps` is an integer (state not explicitly given, but implied by the logic)**

To be more specific, if `i` was the `j`-th character of `s`, then in the next iteration, `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character of `s`. However, since the exact state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` are not provided, we can't adjust those. The only thing we know for certain is the adjustment of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one**
