You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Key Points:
1. **Subsequence Check**: We need to verify if every possible string of length `n` formed from the first `k` alphabets is a subsequence of `s`.
2. **Output**: If all possible strings are subsequences, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" and provide a specific string of length `n` that is not a subsequence.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a set `win` to track characters that have been seen in the string `s` and that are within the first `k` alphabets. It also seems to track the number of times a complete set of `k` characters is seen (`ps`).

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Check**:
   - The program does not correctly check for subsequences. It simply counts the number of times a complete set of `k` characters is seen, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.
   - The program does not attempt to match subsequences of length `n` directly.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters from `us` (the set of first `k` alphabets) to `ans` and appending additional 'a' characters. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings of Length `n`**:
   - Use a nested loop or a recursive approach to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
2. **Check Each String as a Subsequence**:
   - For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output the Result**:
   - If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and generate a missing subsequence if necessary. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
