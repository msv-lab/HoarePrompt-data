Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is either in `us` or not. If `i` is in `us`, then if the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `win` becomes an empty set, `ans` becomes a list containing the element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `win` contains the element `i`, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` is set to 0. If `i` is not in `us`, there are no changes to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, then if `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `win` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one. If `i` is in `us`, `win` includes the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, then `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` includes the character `i` appended to it, and `ps` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
