Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The variable `win` is initialized as an empty set, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged.
