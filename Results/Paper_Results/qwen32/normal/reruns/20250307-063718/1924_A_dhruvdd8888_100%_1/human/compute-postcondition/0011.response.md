Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set containing `k` elements; `ans` is a list containing the element `i`; `ps` is 1; `i` is in `us`. The current size of `win` is `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `ps` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
