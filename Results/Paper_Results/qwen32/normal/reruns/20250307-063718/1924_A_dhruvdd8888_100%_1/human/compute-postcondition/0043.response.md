Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`, and `i` remain as per their initial definitions except `i` is the next element in `us` that has not yet been used. If `i` is not in `win`, the function returns a string formed by concatenating the elements of `ans`, the element `i` from `us`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` number of 'a' characters.**
