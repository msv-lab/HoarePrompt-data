Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is in `us`. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the element `i`, and `ps` is 1. Otherwise, `win` contains the element `i`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 0.**
