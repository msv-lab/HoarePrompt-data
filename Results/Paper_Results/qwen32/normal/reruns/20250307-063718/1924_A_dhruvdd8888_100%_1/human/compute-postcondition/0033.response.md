The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and will output the string `'NO'`.
2. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
