Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, then if `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `win` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.**
