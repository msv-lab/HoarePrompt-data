Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one. If `i` is in `us`, `win` includes the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, then `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` includes the character `i` appended to it, and `ps` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.**
