Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Checking Subsequences**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences of `s`. The program attempts to find a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and then assumes that this implies all subsequences of length `n` are present, which is incorrect.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**: The program's approach to generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It tries to append characters to `ans` and then appends additional characters to form a string of length `n`, but this does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `n` is larger than the number of unique characters in `s` or when no valid subsequence can be formed.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:

- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not found, print "NO" and the missing string.
- If all strings are found, print "YES".

Here is a simplified approach to solve the problem:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    for sub in all_subsequences:
        if not is_subsequence(s, sub):
            print('NO')
            print(sub)
            break
    else:
        print('YES')
```

This code generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if each is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing subsequence is found, it prints "NO" and the subsequence; otherwise, it prints "YES". Note that this approach may not be efficient for large `n` and `k` due to the exponential number of possible subsequences, but it correctly addresses the problem requirements.
