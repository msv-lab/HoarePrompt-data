The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state includes `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` with specific constraints. After executing the given code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` will be updated based on the input, while `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
