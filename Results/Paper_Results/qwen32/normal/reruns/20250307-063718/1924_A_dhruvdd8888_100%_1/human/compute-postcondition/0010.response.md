The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ps`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now contains the element `i` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set containing `k` elements; `ans` is a list containing the element `i`; `ps` is 0; `i` is in `us`. The current size of `win` is `k`.**
