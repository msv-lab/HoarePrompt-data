The code snippet `win.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `win`. This means that `win` will now contain all the elements it previously had, plus the character `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is the next character in the string `s` and has been added to the set `win`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `win` contains all its previous elements plus the character `i`.**
