Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is either in `us` or not. If `i` is in `us`, then if the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `win` becomes an empty set, `ans` becomes a list containing the element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `win` contains the element `i`, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` is set to 0. If `i` is not in `us`, there are no changes to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.**
