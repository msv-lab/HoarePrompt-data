The given code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, and `win`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
