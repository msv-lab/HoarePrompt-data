### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If all such strings are subsequences, we should print "YES".
- If not, we should print "NO" and provide one such string of length `n` that is not a subsequence.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using a set `win` to track characters seen in `s` and checking if a complete set of `k` characters is seen. However, the logic is flawed:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Check**:
   - The code does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It only checks for the presence of `k` distinct characters in sequence, which is insufficient.
2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
   - The code tries to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters from `us` and additional 'a' characters. This logic does not ensure that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings of Length `n`**:
   - Use a nested loop or a recursive approach to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
2. **Check Each String as a Subsequence**:
   - For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output the Result**:
   - If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary provided describes the logic of `func_1` but does not align with the correct approach for solving the problem. The summary mentions checking for sets of `k` consecutive characters and constructing a string based on this, which is not the correct method for checking subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and generate a missing subsequence if necessary. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
