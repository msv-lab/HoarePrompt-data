The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet
- `i` is either in `us` or not. If `i` is in `us`, then if the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `win` becomes an empty set, `ans` becomes a list containing the element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `win` contains the element `i`, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` is set to 0. If `i` is not in `us`, there are no changes to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character in `s` as `s[j]`. After the current iteration, `i` would have been `s[j]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `s[j+1]`.

Since we only know the state at the end of the previous iteration and not the exact position `j` in the string `s`, we can say that `i` should be the next character in the sequence of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**
