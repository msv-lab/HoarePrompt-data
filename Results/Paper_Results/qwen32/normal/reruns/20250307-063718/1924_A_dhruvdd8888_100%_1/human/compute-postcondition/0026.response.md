Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current one, `win` is an empty set, `ans` includes the character `i` appended to it, `ps` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the `win` set has been cleared, making it empty, while all other variables retain their previous values.
