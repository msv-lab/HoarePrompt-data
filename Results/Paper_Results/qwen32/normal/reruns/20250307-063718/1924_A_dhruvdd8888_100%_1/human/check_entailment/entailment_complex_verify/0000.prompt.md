You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It checks if there are at least `n` occurrences of sets of `k` consecutive characters in `s` that are all within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such occurrences are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it constructs and prints a string of length `n` by appending characters from the sets found, a character from the set of the first `k` alphabets that was not in any set, and padding with 'a' characters if necessary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Logic Error in Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program attempts to check for subsequences by maintaining a set of characters (`win`) that have been seen and adding characters to `ans` when the set `win` contains all `k` characters.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not correctly check for subsequences of length `n`. It only checks if all `k` characters appear in sequence but does not ensure that any specific combination of `n` characters appears as a subsequence in `s`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program may not handle cases where `n` is greater than `k`, as it assumes that any combination of `n` characters can be formed from `k` characters, which is not necessarily true.
   - The program does not correctly generate and check all possible combinations of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets to see if they are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Incorrect Output Generation:**
   - When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, it attempts to generate a missing string by appending characters to `ans`. However, this logic is flawed and may not generate a valid string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
- Here, `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abb"`.
- The possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".
- The program may incorrectly determine that "aa" is a subsequence of `s` (which it is not) and may fail to correctly identify "aa" as a missing subsequence.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets and checking each one to see if it is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not found to be a subsequence, the program should output "NO" followed by that string.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
