The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the set `us`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the set `us` is not empty, as the loop will not execute if `us` is empty.

Given that `us` is defined as a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 26`, we can conclude that `us` will always contain at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `us` to ensure the loop executes.

However, to adhere strictly to the task requirements and the format, we can specify that `us` should contain at least one element, which it does by definition given the constraints on `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each set of `k` consecutive characters from `s` that are all in `us`; `ps` is a list containing the number of times a complete set of `k` characters from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`**
