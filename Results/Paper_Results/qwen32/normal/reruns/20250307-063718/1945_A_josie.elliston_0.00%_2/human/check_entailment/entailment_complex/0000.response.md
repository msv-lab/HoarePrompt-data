### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if they meet the requirements.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. Each introvert requires a separate tent.
2. Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly 3 people.
3. Universals can be in a tent with 1, 2, or 3 people.
4. If it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, the function should return -1.
5. Otherwise, it should return the minimum number of tents needed.

**Function Analysis:**

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- This function deals with the accommodation of extroverts and universals.
- It checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is divisible by 3.
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means the extroverts cannot be perfectly grouped into tents of 3.
  - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the incomplete tent (since each tent must have exactly 3 people).
  - In this case, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as per the rules.
- If the extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of 3 or there are enough universals to fill the incomplete tent, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3. This ensures all extroverts are in tents of 3 and any remaining universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
- It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns -1.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each introvert requires a separate tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum as the total number of tents needed.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the functions with the provided test cases.

1. **Test Case: 1 2 3**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - Extroverts need 1 tent (2 extroverts + 1 universal = 3 people).
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts and universals) = 2.
   - The function should return 2, but the expected output is 3. This indicates a discrepancy.

2. **Test Case: 1 4 1**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - Extroverts need 2 tents (4 extroverts + 2 universals = 6 people, but only 1 universal is available).
   - The function should return -1, which is correct.

3. **Test Case: 1 4 2**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
   - Extroverts need 2 tents (4 extroverts + 2 universals = 6 people).
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3.
   - The function should return 3, which is correct.

4. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1
   - Extroverts need 1 tent (1 extrovert + 2 universals = 3 people, but only 1 universal is available).
   - The function should return -1, which is correct.

5. **Test Case: 1 3 2**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2
   - Extroverts need 1 tent (3 extroverts = 3 people).
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) = 2.
   - The function should return 2, but the expected output is 3. This indicates a discrepancy.

6. **Test Case: 19 7 18**
   - Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
   - Extroverts need 3 tents (7 extroverts + 2 universals = 9 people, 5 universals remain).
   - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts and universals) = 22.
   - The function should return 22, but the expected output is 28. This indicates a discrepancy.

7. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - Total tents: 0 (no participants).
   - The function should return 0, which is correct.

8. **Test Case: 7 0 0**
   - Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - Total tents: 7 (introverts).
   - The function should return 7, which is correct.

9. **Test Case: 0 24 0**
   - Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0
   - Extroverts need 8 tents (24 extroverts = 8 tents).
   - The function should return 8, which is correct.

10. **Test Case: 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000**
    - Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
    - Extroverts need 333333334 tents (1000000000 extroverts + 2 universals = 1000000002 people, 666666666 universals remain).
    - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts and universals) = 1333333334.
    - The function should return 1333333334, but the expected output is 1666666667. This indicates a discrepancy.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly handle the allocation of tents for the test cases where the number of extroverts is not perfectly divisible by 3 and the number of universals is insufficient to fill the incomplete tent. This results in incorrect outputs for several test cases.

**Correctness: False**

The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as per the given test cases.
