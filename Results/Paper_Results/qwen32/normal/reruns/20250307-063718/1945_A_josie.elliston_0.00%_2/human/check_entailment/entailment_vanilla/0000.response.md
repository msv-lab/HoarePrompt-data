Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences:
- Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
- Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The constraints are:
- \(0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9\)
- \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(extroverts, universals)`: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, considering extroverts' requirement to be in groups of three.
2. `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each introvert needs a tent alone) to the number of tents for extroverts and universals calculated by `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`

- If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals can be divided into groups of three. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals according to the rules).
- If the number of extroverts is divisible by 3, or the remaining extroverts can be combined with some universals to form groups of three, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3.

#### Function `func_2`

- It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals, so it returns -1.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly handles all scenarios:

- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so the number of tents for introverts is simply the number of introverts.
- **Extroverts and Universals**: The program correctly checks if the extroverts can be grouped into sets of three, and if any remaining extroverts can be combined with universals to form groups of three. If not, it correctly returns -1.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are no participants of a certain type (e.g., all introverts, all extroverts, all universals, or no participants at all).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
