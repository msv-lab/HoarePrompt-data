Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is not zero and the sum of this remainder and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
