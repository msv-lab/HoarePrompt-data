To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does with its parameters `extroverts` and `universals`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we can only infer that `ret` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. The initial state of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remains unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which it does not in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `ret` now holds the value returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
