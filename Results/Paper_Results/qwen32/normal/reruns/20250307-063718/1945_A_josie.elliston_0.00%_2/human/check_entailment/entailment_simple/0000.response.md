### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required, or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic**:
     - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not a multiple of 3, then the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 must be compensated by universals to form complete groups of 3.
     - If the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 plus the number of universals is less than 3, it is impossible to form the required groups, and the function returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, the function calculates the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the total number of tents needed for all participants, including introverts.
   - **Logic**:
     - Calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals), `func_2` returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, `func_2` returns the sum of the number of introverts and the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with a few test cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
  - Extroverts need 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
  - Total tents: `1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + universals) = 2`
  - However, the correct calculation should be 3 tents (1 for introvert, 1 for 2 extroverts + 1 universal, and 1 for 2 universals).
  - This suggests an error in the logic of `func_1` or `func_2`.

- **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
  - Extroverts need 2 tents for 4 extroverts (1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 tent for 1 extrovert + 1 universal).
  - However, the logic in `func_1` does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

- **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
  - Extroverts need 2 tents for 4 extroverts (1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 tent for 1 extrovert + 1 universal).
  - Total tents: `1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3`
  - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, it appears that `func_1` does not correctly handle the distribution of extroverts and universals into tents. Specifically, the logic for handling the remainder of extroverts is not correctly implemented. The program does not account for the possibility of using universals to fill incomplete groups of extroverts correctly.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
