You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Introverts (a)** need their own tent.
- **Extroverts (b)** need to share a tent with two others.
- **Universals (c)** can be in a tent with 1, 2, or 3 people.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to satisfy all preferences or return -1 if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function aims to determine how many tents are needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a group of 3.
   - If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. **`func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider some test cases to see if the program works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` should return `2` (since 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` should return `None` (since 4 extroverts and 1 universal cannot form complete groups of 3).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` should return `-1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` should return `2` (since 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` should return `None` (since 1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form a complete group of 3).
   - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` should return `-1`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` should return `2` (since 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

Based on the above test cases, the program seems to handle the cases correctly. However, let's consider a more complex case:

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1666666667`
   - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `666666667` (since 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 666666667 tents).
   - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the provided test cases correctly and seems to be logically sound based on the problem description. There is no evident case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals based on their preferences. It properly handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate all participants and returns -1 when necessary. The logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` appears to be correct for all potential input cases.
