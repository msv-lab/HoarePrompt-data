Given the conditions, we need to calculate the return value of `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` based on the initial state.

1. **extroverts** is a non-negative integer.
2. **universals** is a non-negative integer.
3. If the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is not 0, then the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater.

Let's break it down:

- If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, then the return value is simply `ceil(extroverts / 3 + universals / 3)`.
- If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, then `extroverts % 3` is either 1 or 2. In this case, `(extroverts % 3) + universals >= 3`. This means that `universals` is at least `3 - (extroverts % 3)`. So, `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` will always be at least `ceil(extroverts / 3) + 1`.

Given these conditions, the return value will be the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
