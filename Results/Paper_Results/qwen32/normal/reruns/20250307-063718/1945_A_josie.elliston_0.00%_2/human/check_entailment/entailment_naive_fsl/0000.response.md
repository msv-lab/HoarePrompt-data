Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Introverts (a)** need their own tent.
- **Extroverts (b)** need to share a tent with two others.
- **Universals (c)** can be in a tent with 1, 2, or 3 people.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to satisfy all preferences or return -1 if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function aims to determine how many tents are needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a group of 3.
   - If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. **`func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider some test cases to see if the program works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` should return `2` (since 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` should return `None` (since 4 extroverts and 1 universal cannot form complete groups of 3).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` should return `-1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` should return `2` (since 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` should return `None` (since 1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form a complete group of 3).
   - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` should return `-1`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` should return `2` (since 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents).
   - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`.

Based on the above test cases, the program seems to handle the cases correctly. However, let's consider a more complex case:

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1666666667`
   - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `666666667` (since 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 666666667 tents).
   - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the provided test cases correctly and seems to be logically sound based on the problem description. There is no evident case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals based on their preferences. It properly handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate all participants and returns -1 when necessary. The logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` appears to be correct for all potential input cases.
