To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or returns -1 if it's impossible to do so.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic the program should follow:

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs their own tent, so the number of tents needed for introverts is simply `a`.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, so the number of tents needed for extroverts is `ceil(b / 3)`. However, if `b % 3 != 0`, there will be leftover extroverts who need to be paired with universals.
3. **Universals**: Universals can be used to fill any gaps left by introverts or extroverts. If there are leftover extroverts (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`), universals can be used to complete the tents. Specifically, if `b % 3 + c < 3`, it's impossible to accommodate the leftover extroverts, and the function should return -1.

Let's analyze `func_1` and `func_2`:

- **func_1(extroverts, universals)**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, the function checks if the leftover extroverts and available universals can form a complete tent. If not, it returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**:
  - It calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1`, giving the total number of tents required.

Now, let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Test case 1 (1, 2, 3)**:
   - Introverts: 1 tent.
   - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent together, and 1 universal can join them.
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts and universal) = 2.
   - However, 1 universal is left, so we need 1 more tent for the universal.
   - Total tents: 3.
   - The program correctly outputs 3.

2. **Test case 2 (1, 4, 1)**:
   - Introverts: 1 tent.
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but 1 universal is available.
   - 1 extrovert and 1 universal form a tent, but 1 extrovert is left.
   - The program correctly outputs -1 because it's impossible to accommodate the leftover extrovert.

3. **Test case 3 (1, 4, 2)**:
   - Introverts: 1 tent.
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but 2 universals are available.
   - 1 extrovert and 1 universal form a tent, and another extrovert and universal form a tent.
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3.
   - The program correctly outputs 3.

4. **Test case 4 (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Introverts: 1 tent.
   - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1 tent, but 1 universal is available.
   - 1 extrovert and 1 universal form a tent.
   - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extrovert and universal) = 2.
   - However, 1 universal is left, so we need 1 more tent for the universal.
   - Total tents: 3.
   - The program incorrectly outputs -1.

The program fails in test case 4, indicating that the logic in `func_1` or `func_2` may not be correctly handling certain scenarios.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
