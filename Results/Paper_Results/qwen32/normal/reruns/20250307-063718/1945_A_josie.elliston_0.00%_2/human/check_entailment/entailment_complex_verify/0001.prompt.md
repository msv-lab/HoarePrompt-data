You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences:
- Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
- Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The constraints are:
- \(0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9\)
- \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(extroverts, universals)`: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, considering extroverts' requirement to be in groups of three.
2. `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each introvert needs a tent alone) to the number of tents for extroverts and universals calculated by `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`

- If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals can be divided into groups of three. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals according to the rules).
- If the number of extroverts is divisible by 3, or the remaining extroverts can be combined with some universals to form groups of three, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3.

#### Function `func_2`

- It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals, so it returns -1.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly handles all scenarios:

- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so the number of tents for introverts is simply the number of introverts.
- **Extroverts and Universals**: The program correctly checks if the extroverts can be grouped into sets of three, and if any remaining extroverts can be combined with universals to form groups of three. If not, it correctly returns -1.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are no participants of a certain type (e.g., all introverts, all extroverts, all universals, or no participants at all).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
