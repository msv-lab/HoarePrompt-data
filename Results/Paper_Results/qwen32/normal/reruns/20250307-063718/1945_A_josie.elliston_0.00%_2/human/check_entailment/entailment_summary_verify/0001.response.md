### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program using the given function summaries and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Introverts** (a) must each be in a tent alone.
- **Extroverts** (b) must be in tents with exactly two others.
- **Universals** (c) can be in tents alone, with one other person, or with two others.
- The goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting these preferences. If it's impossible, return -1.

#### Analysis of the Functions:
1. **`func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:**
   - **Purpose:** Determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means extroverts cannot be fully grouped into sets of three.
     - In this case, check if the remaining extroverts can be combined with universals to form groups of three.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it's impossible to form a valid group, so return `None`.
     - Otherwise, return `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **`func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of tents needed.
   - **Logic:**
     - Call `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, return -1 (impossible to accommodate).
     - Otherwise, return the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`.

#### Verification:
- **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a tent alone, so the number of tents for introverts is `a`.
- **Extroverts and Universals:**
  - If `b % 3 == 0`, then `b` extroverts can be perfectly grouped into `b // 3` tents.
  - If `b % 3 != 0`, then `b % 3` extroverts need to be combined with universals to form groups of three.
  - The function correctly handles the case where combining extroverts and universals into groups of three is impossible.
  - The function correctly calculates the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` to determine the number of tents needed.

#### Edge Cases:
- **All introverts:** `a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`. The result should be `a`.
- **All extroverts:** `a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`. The result should be `ceil(b / 3)` if possible, otherwise -1.
- **All universals:** `a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`. The result should be `ceil(c / 3)`.
- **No participants:** `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`. The result should be `0`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios and edge cases as described. The logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
