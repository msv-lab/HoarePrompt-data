The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`), but these variables are not used in the given print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and prints the string 'YES'.
2. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not referenced in the print statement.
3. Since the print statement does not depend on any of these variables, the output will always be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
