Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
   - `t` is set to 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - If `n` is 2, no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n` regardless of the value of `s`.
   - If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` and retains its parity (odd or even).
   - The presence of the substring '11' in `s` is noted but does not affect the variables based on the given conditions.
   - The if-else block does not modify any variables based on the condition `s == '00'`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains only one `print` statement: `print('YES')`.
   - This `print` statement does not depend on any variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`, etc.) and will execute regardless of the values of these variables.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will always print the string "YES" regardless of the values of the variables.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
