Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user. If `n` is 2, then no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n` regardless of the value of `s`. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even). Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'; otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in the string `s` is not equal to 1.**
