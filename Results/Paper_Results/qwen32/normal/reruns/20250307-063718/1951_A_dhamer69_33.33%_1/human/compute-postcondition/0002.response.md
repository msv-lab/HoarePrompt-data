Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, `start` and `end` remain integers with the condition `start <= end`. The variable `t` retains its value as an input integer greater than 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of a new input integer.
