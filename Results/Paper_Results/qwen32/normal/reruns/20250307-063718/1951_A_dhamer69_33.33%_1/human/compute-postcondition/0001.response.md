To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Given the condition `t > 0`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`. The current state specifies that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify its value. To make sure the loop can execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` must be greater than 0**
