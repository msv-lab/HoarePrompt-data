Output State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end; t is 0; no changes are made to start, end, or t regardless of the values of n or s in the loop body.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `t` is set to 0. The values of `n` and `s` do not affect the state of `start`, `end`, or `t` once the loop finishes executing.
