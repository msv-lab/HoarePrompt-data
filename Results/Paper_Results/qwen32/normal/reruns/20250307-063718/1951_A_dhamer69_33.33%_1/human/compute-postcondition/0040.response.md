Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- If `n` is 2, no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n` regardless of the value of `s`.
- If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` and retains its parity (odd or even).
- If the original `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'; otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in the original string `s` is not equal to 1.
- The if-else block does not modify any variables based on the condition `s == '00'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that directly outputs the string `'YES'`. This output is independent of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The `if-else` block that is described in the initial state does not affect the `print` statement because it does not modify any variables that would influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
