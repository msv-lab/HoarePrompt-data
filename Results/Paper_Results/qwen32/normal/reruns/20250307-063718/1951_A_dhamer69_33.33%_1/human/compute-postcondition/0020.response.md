Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, then `count_1` remains even and if the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in the string `s` is not equal to 1.**
