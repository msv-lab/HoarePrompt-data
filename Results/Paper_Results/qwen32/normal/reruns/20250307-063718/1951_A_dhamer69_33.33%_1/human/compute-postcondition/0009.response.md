Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer with the current value of `n` being 2; `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` equals '00', then no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n`. Otherwise, if `s` is not equal to '00', no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n`.**
