The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This affects the variable `count_1`, which is newly introduced, and its value is determined by the content of `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.**
