Based on the provided initial state and the print statement, we need to determine what will be printed. Let's break down the information given:

1. `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
2. `t` is an integer and `t` must be at least 1.
3. `n` is an integer input by the user.
4. `s` is a string input by the user.
5. `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
6. If `n` is 2, no changes are made to `start`, `end`, `t`, or `n` regardless of the value of `s`.
7. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even).
8. If the original `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in the original string `s` is not equal to 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
