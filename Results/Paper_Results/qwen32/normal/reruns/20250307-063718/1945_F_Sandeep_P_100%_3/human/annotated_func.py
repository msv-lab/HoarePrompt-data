#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string that will be used as a placeholder for a recursive call in a repr function.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue`, which is a string used as a placeholder for a recursive call in a repr function, and it returns `decorating_function`.
