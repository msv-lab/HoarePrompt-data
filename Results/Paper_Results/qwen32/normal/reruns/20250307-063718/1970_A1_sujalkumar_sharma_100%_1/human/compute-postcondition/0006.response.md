The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Given that the initial value of `balance` is 1, after the execution, `balance` will be 2. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `prefix_balance`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, '(')]`; `balance` is 2; `i` is 0; the current character at `s[i]` is '('**.
