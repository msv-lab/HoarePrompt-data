The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `prefix_balance`. This action does not change the values of the existing variables `s` and `n`. The string `s` remains a balanced parentheses sequence, and `n` remains the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list.**
