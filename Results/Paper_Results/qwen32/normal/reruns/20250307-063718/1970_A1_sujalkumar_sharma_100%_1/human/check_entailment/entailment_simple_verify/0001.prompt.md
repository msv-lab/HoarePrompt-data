You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple is `(balance_before, index, character)`, representing the balance before processing the character at the given index; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` composed of characters from `s` in the order they appear in the `prefix_balance` list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to implement a "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. This involves:
1. Calculating the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
2. Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order, with ties broken by position in descending order.
3. Constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Solution Analysis
1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The code initializes `balance` to 0 and iterates over the string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the list `prefix_balance`, where `balance` is the prefix balance up to the current character, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
   - It then updates the `balance` by adding 1 for '(' and subtracting 1 for ')'.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `prefix_balance` is sorted using a lambda function as the key. The key sorts primarily by the prefix balance (`x[0]`), and secondarily by the negative of the position (`-x[1]`), which ensures that ties in prefix balance are broken by position in descending order.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The sorted list `prefix_balance` is then used to construct the result string by joining the characters (`x[2]` for each tuple `x` in `prefix_balance`).

### Correctness Verification
- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: This part is correctly implemented. The balance is correctly updated for each character, and the prefix balance is stored along with the character and its position.
- **Sorting**: The sorting logic is correct according to the problem's requirements. Sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and breaking ties by position in descending order ensures that the characters are rearranged as per the problem statement.
- **Result Construction**: The result is correctly constructed by extracting the characters from the sorted list.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
