To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string of balanced parentheses.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, s[0])]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `balance` is 2 if `s[i]` is '(', otherwise -1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s` and does not change throughout the loop iterations.

The state of `prefix_balance` and `balance` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration. However, for completeness, we can note that `prefix_balance` will be updated within the loop body, and `balance` will be recalculated based on the value of `s[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, s[0])]`; `i` is 1.**
