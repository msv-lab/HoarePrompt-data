Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1])]`; `i` is 1; `balance` is `balance - 1`.**

In natural language: The string `s` remains unchanged, still consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The variable `n`, which is the length of `s`, remains unchanged. The list `prefix_balance` also remains unchanged in terms of its structure and the first tuple, but the `balance` value in the second tuple is decremented by 1. The variable `i` remains 1.
