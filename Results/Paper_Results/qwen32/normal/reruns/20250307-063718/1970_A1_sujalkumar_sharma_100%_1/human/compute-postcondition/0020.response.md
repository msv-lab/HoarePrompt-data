Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple is `(balance_before, index, character)`, representing the balance before processing the character at the given index; `balance` is 0.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `prefix_balance` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the balance of the parentheses sequence up to but not including the character at the corresponding index in the string `s`. The final `balance` will be 0 because the sequence is balanced, meaning every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
