The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on a custom key. The key is a tuple where the first element is `balance_before` and the second element is the negative of `index`. This means the list will be sorted first by `balance_before` in ascending order, and for elements with the same `balance_before`, it will be sorted by `index` in descending order.

The `s`, `n`, and `balance` variables are not affected by this sorting operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples, sorted by `balance_before` in ascending order and by `index` in descending order for tuples with the same `balance_before`; `balance` is 0.**
