The code snippet appends a tuple to the `prefix_balance` list. The tuple contains the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. Given the initial state, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is the first character of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, s[0])]`; `balance` is 0; `i` is 0**.
