The code snippet `balance -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), (balance, 2, s[2])]`. After the decrement operation, the value of `balance` in the second and third tuples of `prefix_balance` will be updated to `balance - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance - 1, 1, s[1]), (balance - 1, 2, s[2])]`; `i` is 2.**
