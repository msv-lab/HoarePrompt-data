The code snippet appends a tuple to the `prefix_balance` list. The tuple contains the current `balance`, the current index `i`, and the character at position `i` in the string `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, s[0])]`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code snippet:
- `prefix_balance` will now contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one.
- The newly appended tuple is `(balance, i, s[i])`. Since `i` is 1, the tuple will be `(balance, 1, s[1])`.

The value of `balance` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that it is calculated based on the parentheses sequence. Since `prefix_balance` already contains the first character of `s` with its balance, we can assume that `balance` is updated based on the character at index 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1])]`; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the `prefix_balance` list now includes a second tuple representing the balance, index, and character at position 1 of the string `s`.
