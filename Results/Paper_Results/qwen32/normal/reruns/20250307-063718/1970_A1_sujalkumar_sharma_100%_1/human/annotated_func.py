#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple is `(balance_before, index, character)`, representing the balance before processing the character at the given index; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` composed of characters from `s` in the order they appear in the `prefix_balance` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string where the characters from `s` are reordered based on their balance values and indices.
