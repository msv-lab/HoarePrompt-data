Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to implement a "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. This involves:
1. Calculating the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
2. Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order, with ties broken by position in descending order.
3. Constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Solution Analysis
1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The code initializes `balance` to 0 and iterates over the string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the list `prefix_balance`, where `balance` is the prefix balance up to the current character, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
   - It then updates the `balance` by adding 1 for '(' and subtracting 1 for ')'.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `prefix_balance` is sorted using a lambda function as the key. The key sorts primarily by the prefix balance (`x[0]`), and secondarily by the negative of the position (`-x[1]`), which ensures that ties in prefix balance are broken by position in descending order.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The sorted list `prefix_balance` is then used to construct the result string by joining the characters (`x[2]` for each tuple `x` in `prefix_balance`).

### Correctness Verification
- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: This part is correctly implemented. The balance is correctly updated for each character, and the prefix balance is stored along with the character and its position.
- **Sorting**: The sorting logic is correct according to the problem's requirements. Sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and breaking ties by position in descending order ensures that the characters are rearranged as per the problem statement.
- **Result Construction**: The result is correctly constructed by extracting the characters from the sorted list.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
