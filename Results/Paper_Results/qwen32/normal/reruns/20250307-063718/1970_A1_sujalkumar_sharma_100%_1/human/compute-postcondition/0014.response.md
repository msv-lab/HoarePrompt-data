Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1])]`; `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '(', then `balance` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `balance` is decremented by 1.**
