The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The initial state specifies that `balance` is the second element of the second tuple in the `prefix_balance` list, which is `prefix_balance[1][0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples: `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1])]`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing `balance += 1`, the new value of `balance` will be `prefix_balance[1][0] + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (prefix_balance[1][0] + 1, 1, s[1])]`; `i` is 1.**
