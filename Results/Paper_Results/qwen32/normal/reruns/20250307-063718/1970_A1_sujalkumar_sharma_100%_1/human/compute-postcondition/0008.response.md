The code snippet `balance -= 1` decreases the value of the variable `balance` by 1. Given that the initial value of `balance` is 0, after executing this code, `balance` will be -1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple `[(0, 0, s[0])]`; `balance` is -1; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is not '('**.
