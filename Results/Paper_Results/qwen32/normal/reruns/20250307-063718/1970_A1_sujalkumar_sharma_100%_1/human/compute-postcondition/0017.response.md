The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `balance`, we can only describe the change in terms of the operation performed. The other variables `s`, `n`, `prefix_balance`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), (balance, 2, s[2])]`; `i` is 2; `balance` is increased by 1.**
