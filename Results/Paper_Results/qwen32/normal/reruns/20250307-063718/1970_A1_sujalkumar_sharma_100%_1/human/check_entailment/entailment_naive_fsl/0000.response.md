Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error. The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`. The correct order should be to define the function first and then call it. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

This change ensures that the function `func_1` is defined before it is called. The logic of the function itself seems correct based on the problem description. It calculates the prefix balance for each character, sorts them according to the prefix balance and position, and then constructs the balanced shuffle sequence. However, the original order of the function definition and call was incorrect, making the program non-functional.
