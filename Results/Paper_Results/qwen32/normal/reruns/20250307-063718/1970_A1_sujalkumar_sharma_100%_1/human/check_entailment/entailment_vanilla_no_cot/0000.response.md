Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a logical error. The function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the `print(func_1(s))` statement, which will cause a `NameError` because `func_1` is not recognized at the point of the function call. To fix this, the definition of `func_1` should be placed before the call to `func_1(s)`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
