The code snippet appends a new tuple to the `prefix_balance` list. This tuple contains three elements: `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, and `s[i]` is the third character of the string `s` (since indexing starts at 0). The value of `balance` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet, so we'll keep it as `balance`.

The `prefix_balance` list initially contains two tuples:
1. `(0, 0, s[0])`
2. `(balance, 1, s[1])`

After the code snippet is executed, `prefix_balance` will have a third tuple:
3. `(balance, 2, s[2])`

The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, and it is not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples `[(0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), (balance, 2, s[2])]`; `i` is 2.**
