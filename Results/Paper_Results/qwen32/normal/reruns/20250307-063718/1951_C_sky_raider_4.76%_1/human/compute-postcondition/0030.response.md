The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer from input. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`s`, `k`, `c`, and `l[i]`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted here.

State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 1**
