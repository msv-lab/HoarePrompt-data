Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
