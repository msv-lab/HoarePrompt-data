The code snippet provided is `k -= s`, which means `k` is updated to `k - s`. Therefore, `k` will be reduced by the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `s` is `min(m, k)`.
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- `k` is `k - s`.

After executing `k -= s`, `k` becomes `k - s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`; `k` is `k - s`.**

In simple terms, `k` is now `k` minus `s`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
