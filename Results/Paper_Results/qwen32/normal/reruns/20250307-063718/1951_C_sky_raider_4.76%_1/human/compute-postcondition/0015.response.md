The variable `s` is assigned the value of `min(m, k)`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**
