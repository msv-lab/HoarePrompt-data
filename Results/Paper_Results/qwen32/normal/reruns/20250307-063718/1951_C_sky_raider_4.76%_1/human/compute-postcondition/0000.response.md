In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input, which determines the number of iterations. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not directly part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state related to the loop head, which is the integer value provided by `input()`.

To ensure that the loop executes, the integer value read from the input must be at least 1. This value corresponds to the number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Analysis:
- The loop head only contains `i` and the range determined by `int(input())`.
- For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value is greater than 0. Since the input value determines the number of iterations, it must be a positive integer.

### Final State:
State: **The input value must be a positive integer (greater than 0).**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
