The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `n + 1`. After the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values provided by the input, and `i` will remain as `n + 1`, but with the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` is `n + 1`**
