The code snippet `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` modifies the value of `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Given:
- `c` is initially `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
- The code adds `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to `c`

The new value of `c` becomes:
\[ c = (k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2) + (l[i] * s - s * s / 2) \]
\[ c = k * k / 2 + 3 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2) \]

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 3 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`**
