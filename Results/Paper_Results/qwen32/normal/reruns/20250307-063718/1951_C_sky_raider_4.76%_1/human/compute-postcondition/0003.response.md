The code snippet `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` is now ordered from the smallest to the largest integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
