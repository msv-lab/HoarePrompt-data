Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2`; `k` is `k - s`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been reduced by the value of `s` (which is the minimum of `m` and `k`). All other variables remain unchanged.
