The value of `k` is decremented by `s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 1, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `k` is `k - s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 1, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`**.
