The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the initial state only specifies that the input value must be a positive integer, we will assume that the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer.**

This means that after executing the code, `n`, `m`, and `k` will each hold a positive integer value as provided by the input.
