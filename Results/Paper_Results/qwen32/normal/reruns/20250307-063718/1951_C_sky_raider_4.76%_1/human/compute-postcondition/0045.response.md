The code snippet calculates the value of `c` as `k * k / 2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. The new variable `c` is introduced with the calculated value.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` is `n + 1`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is 0; `c` is `k * k / 2`.**
