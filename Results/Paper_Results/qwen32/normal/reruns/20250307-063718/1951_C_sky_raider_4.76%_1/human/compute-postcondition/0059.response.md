To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and identify the value of the variable `c`.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. `n`: An integer representing the number of elements in a list (likely `s`).
2. `m`: An integer.
3. `k - (s1 + s2 + ... + sn)`: This suggests that `k` is an integer, and `s1, s2, ..., sn` are elements of a list `s` with `n` elements.
4. `l`: Another list with `n` elements.
5. `min(m, k)`: The minimum value between `m` and `k`.
6. `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2) for i from 0 to n-1`: This is a formula for calculating the value of `c`.

### Formula for `c`
The value of `c` is calculated using the formula:
\[ c = k * k / 2 + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i] * s - s * s / 2) \]

However, there's an issue here: the formula involves `s` but `s` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Given the context, it's likely that `s` is a list of integers with `n` elements, and `s` could be `s1, s2, ..., sn`.

### Simplified Formula
Let's assume `s` is a list where `s[i]` corresponds to `si` in the sum. The formula then becomes:
\[ c = k * k / 2 + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i] * s[i] - s[i] * s[i] / 2) \]

### Value of `c`
The exact value of `c` depends on the values of `k`, `n`, `l`, and `s`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `c` in terms of the formula.

### Print Statement
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

### Final Output
Given the information provided, the output will be the integer value of `c` calculated using the formula above.

Output: **c (where c is calculated as k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s[i] - s[i] * s[i] / 2) for i from 0 to n-1)**
