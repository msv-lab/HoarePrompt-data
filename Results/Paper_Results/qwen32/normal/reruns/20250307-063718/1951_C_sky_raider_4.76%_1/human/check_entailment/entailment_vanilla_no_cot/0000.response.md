Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Logic Error**: The variable `c` is incorrectly initialized as `k * k / 2` which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The cost should start at 0 and accumulate based on the number of tickets bought and the prices.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The loop iterates over the sorted list `l` and attempts to buy tickets based on the sorted prices, but it does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.
3. **Handling of `m`**: The variable `m` (maximum tickets per day) is not correctly handled. The program simply sets `s` to the minimum of `m` and `k` but does not adjust the prices for subsequent days.
4. **Output**: The final cost `c` is not correctly calculated, resulting in incorrect outputs for the test cases.

A correct approach would involve using a greedy algorithm to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increases due to previous purchases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_cost = 0
        increase = 0
        while k > 0:
            l.sort()
            for j in range(min(m, k)):
                total_cost += l[j] + increase
                k -= 1
                if k == 0:
                    break
            increase += m
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of prices each time before purchasing tickets, ensuring that tickets are bought at the lowest possible price available, and correctly updates the price increase for subsequent days.
