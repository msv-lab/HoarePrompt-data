The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `i` is still equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` is `n + 1`; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
