Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`; `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is recalculated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
