The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not been specified explicitly, but we can infer that it was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Since the loop is `for i in range(n)`, `i` must have been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`, we need to increase `i` by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**  
Since `i` is incremented by 1, if it was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. However, without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**  
To be more precise in the context of the loop:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**  

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final state considering only `i` and `n` is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**
