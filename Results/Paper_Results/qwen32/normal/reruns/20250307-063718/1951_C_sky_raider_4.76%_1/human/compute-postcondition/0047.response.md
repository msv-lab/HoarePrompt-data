The value of `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2`.**
