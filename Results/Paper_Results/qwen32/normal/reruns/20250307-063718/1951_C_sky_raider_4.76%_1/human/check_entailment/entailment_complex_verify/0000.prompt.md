You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost in a way that doesn't align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the line `c = k * k / 2` and the subsequent `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` do not correctly account for the cumulative price increases due to previous purchases.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program sorts the list of prices and then iteratively tries to buy tickets in a way that does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints. The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)`, which is a good start, but the cost calculation is incorrect.

3. **Cumulative Price Increase**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the cumulative price increase for subsequent days after a purchase. For example, if you buy `x` tickets on day `i`, the price per ticket for all subsequent days should increase by `x`. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of tickets to be bought `k` is less than the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day `m`, or when the number of days `n` is very large.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the provided example:
```
Input:
4
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5

Expected Output:
10
64
1
72
```

For the first test case:
- The program will try to buy tickets in a way that does not correctly account for the price increases. It might end up buying tickets on days with higher prices due to incorrect cost calculations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a greedy approach where we buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the cumulative price increases. This can be efficiently implemented using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest day available.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import heapq

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        cost = 0
        increase = 0
        while k > 0:
            price = heapq.heappop(prices)
            buy = min(m, k)
            cost += buy * (price + increase)
            k -= buy
            increase += buy
            heapq.heappush(prices, price + increase)
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version uses a min-heap to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the cumulative price increases. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.
