Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem of purchasing `k` tickets at the minimum cost over `n` days with daily ticket limits `m` and given daily ticket prices. However, the program contains several logical and algorithmic errors that make it incorrect.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program initializes `c` with `k * k / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem. The cost `c` should be initialized to 0, as we are accumulating the total cost of purchasing tickets.

2. **Incorrect Purchase Logic**: The program uses `s = min(m, k)` to determine the number of tickets to purchase on each day. However, it does not account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. Instead, it should use a greedy approach to always buy the maximum possible tickets on the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation**: The program accumulates the cost using `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which again is incorrect. The correct way to accumulate the cost is to multiply the number of tickets purchased by the current price of the ticket, taking into account the increment due to previous purchases.

4. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices, which is a good start, but it does not correctly handle the purchasing logic after sorting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        cost = 0
        increment = 0
        
        for price in l:
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + increment)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increment += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, we sort the prices and then iterate through them, buying the maximum possible tickets each day while keeping track of the price increment due to previous purchases.

Correctness: **False**
