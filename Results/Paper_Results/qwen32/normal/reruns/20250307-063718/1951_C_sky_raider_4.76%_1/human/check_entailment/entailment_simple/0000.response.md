Let's analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem description and the expected behavior based on the given examples.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- On each day, you can buy at most `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on a given day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the list of ticket prices.
2. Initializing a cost variable `c` to `k * k / 2`.
3. Iterating over the sorted list of prices and attempting to buy tickets in a way that minimizes the cost.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The cost should start at 0, and the initial value should not depend on `k * k / 2`.
2. **Buying Logic**: The program tries to buy `min(m, k)` tickets on each day, but it does not correctly account for the increase in ticket prices on subsequent days. The logic for updating the cost and the remaining tickets is incorrect.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is not correct. The cost should be `l[i] * s` for the tickets bought on day `i`, and the subsequent days' prices should be updated accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the list of ticket prices.
2. Iterate over the sorted list and buy tickets in such a way that we minimize the cost, taking into account the increase in prices on subsequent days.
3. Keep track of the total cost and the remaining tickets to be bought.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly handle the logic of buying tickets and updating the prices on subsequent days.
