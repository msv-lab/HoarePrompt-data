The value of `c` is reassigned to `k * k / 2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `m` is a positive integer from input, `k` is a positive integer from input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
