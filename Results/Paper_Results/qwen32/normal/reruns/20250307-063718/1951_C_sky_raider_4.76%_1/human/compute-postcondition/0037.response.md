The code snippet provided is:
```python
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

In the initial state, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer from input
- `i` is 2
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `k` is `k - 2 * s`
- `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`

The code modifies the value of `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to it. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 2, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * l[2] * s - s * s / 2`**

In natural language: The value of `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[2] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. All other variables retain their initial values.
