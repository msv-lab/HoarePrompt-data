Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost in a way that doesn't align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the line `c = k * k / 2` and the subsequent `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` do not correctly account for the cumulative price increases due to previous purchases.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program sorts the list of prices and then iteratively tries to buy tickets in a way that does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints. The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)`, which is a good start, but the cost calculation is incorrect.

3. **Cumulative Price Increase**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the cumulative price increase for subsequent days after a purchase. For example, if you buy `x` tickets on day `i`, the price per ticket for all subsequent days should increase by `x`. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of tickets to be bought `k` is less than the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day `m`, or when the number of days `n` is very large.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the provided example:
```
Input:
4
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5

Expected Output:
10
64
1
72
```

For the first test case:
- The program will try to buy tickets in a way that does not correctly account for the price increases. It might end up buying tickets on days with higher prices due to incorrect cost calculations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a greedy approach where we buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the cumulative price increases. This can be efficiently implemented using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest day available.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import heapq

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        cost = 0
        increase = 0
        while k > 0:
            price = heapq.heappop(prices)
            buy = min(m, k)
            cost += buy * (price + increase)
            k -= buy
            increase += buy
            heapq.heappush(prices, price + increase)
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version uses a min-heap to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the cumulative price increases. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.
