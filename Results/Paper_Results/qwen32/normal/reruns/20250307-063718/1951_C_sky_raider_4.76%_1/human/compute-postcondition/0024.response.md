Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `m` is a positive integer from input, `k` is a positive integer from input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s - s * s / 2 for i in range(n))`, `i` is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values. The value of `c` remains as it was calculated previously since `s` was reset to 0 after the calculation of `c`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1.
