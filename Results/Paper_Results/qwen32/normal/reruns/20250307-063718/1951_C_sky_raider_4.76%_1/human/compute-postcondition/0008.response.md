The value of `k` is decremented by `s` (which is the minimum of `m` and `k`). The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2`**.
