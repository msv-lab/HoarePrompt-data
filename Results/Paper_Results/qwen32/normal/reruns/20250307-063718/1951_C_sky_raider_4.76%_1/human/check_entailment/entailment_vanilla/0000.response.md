Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with the goal of minimizing the total cost. The cost of tickets increases based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
3. Sorting the list of ticket prices.
4. Initializing `s` to 0 and `c` to `k * k / 2`.
5. Iterating over each day and:
   - Setting `s` to the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - Decreasing `k` by `s`.
   - Updating `c` by adding the cost of `s` tickets on the current day, adjusted by `s * s / 2`.
6. Printing the final cost `c`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `s * s / 2` seems to be an attempt to adjust the cost, but it does not correctly reflect the problem's rules.
2. **Initialization of `c`**: The initial value of `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which is not meaningful in the context of the problem.
3. **Logic for Buying Tickets**: The logic for buying tickets does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the list of ticket prices.
2. Iterate over the sorted list, buying as many tickets as possible each day without exceeding `m` or the remaining tickets needed.
3. Adjust the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the correct approach:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        cost = 0
        increase = 0
        day = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets_to_buy * (l[day] + increase)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increase += tickets_to_buy
            day += 1
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect cost calculations and logic for buying tickets. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
