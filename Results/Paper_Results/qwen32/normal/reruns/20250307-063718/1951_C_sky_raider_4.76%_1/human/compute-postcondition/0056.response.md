The code snippet provided is `k -= s`, which means `k` is updated to `k - s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `n`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is calculated as `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
- `k` is then updated to `k - s`

After the code `k -= s` is executed, the value of `k` will be `k - s`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**

Note: The value of `c` is recalculated based on the new value of `k`, but the formula for `c` remains unchanged.
