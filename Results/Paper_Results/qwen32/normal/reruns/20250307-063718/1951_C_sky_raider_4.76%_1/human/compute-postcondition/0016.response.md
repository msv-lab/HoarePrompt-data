The value of `k` is decremented by the value of `s`, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, and `k` is `k - s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`**.
