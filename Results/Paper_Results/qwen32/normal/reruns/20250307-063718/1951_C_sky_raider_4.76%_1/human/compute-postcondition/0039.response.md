To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the variables and their relationships based on the provided initial state:

- `i` is set to `n`.
- `s` is set to 0 if `k` is 0 or less; otherwise, it's the minimum of `m` and the remaining `k`.
- `k` is the remaining value after all iterations.
- `c` is the final accumulated value.

However, the provided information does not include any explicit values for `n`, `m`, `k`, or the logic that modifies `c` over iterations. Since the task is to determine the output of `print(int(c))`, we need to focus on the variable `c`.

Given the lack of explicit values or iteration logic, we can only describe `c` based on the information provided. If there were specific operations or loops modifying `c`, we would need those details to compute an exact value. Since such details are not provided, we can only describe `c` as the final accumulated value.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `c`, which is the final accumulated value after all operations (if any) have been performed.

Output: **c (where c is the final accumulated value)**
