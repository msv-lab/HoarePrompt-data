To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it modifies the variables:

The code snippet is:
```
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

This line modifies the value of `c` based on the current values of `l[i]`, `s`, and `c`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged except for `k` which was previously defined but not modified in this snippet.

Here's the updated value of `c`:
- `c` was initially `k * k / 2`
- It is now `c + (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `s` is `min(m, k)`.
- `c` is `k * k / 2`.
- `k` is `k - s`.

After the code snippet, `k` remains `k - s` as it is not modified in this snippet.

The new value of `c` is:
- `c = k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`; `k` is `k - s`.**
