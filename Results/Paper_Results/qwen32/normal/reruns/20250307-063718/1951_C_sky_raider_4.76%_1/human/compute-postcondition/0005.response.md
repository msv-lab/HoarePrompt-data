The value of `c` is calculated as `k * k / 2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`.**
