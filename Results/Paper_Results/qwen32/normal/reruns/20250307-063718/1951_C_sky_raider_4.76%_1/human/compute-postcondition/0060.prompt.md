Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by the sum of `s` values over all iterations, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in the last iteration, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s - s * s / 2 for i in range(n))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `i` is `n`.
- `s` is 0 if `k` is 0 or less; otherwise, it's the minimum of `m` and the remaining `k`.
- `k` is the remaining value after all iterations.
- `c` is the final accumulated value.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k - (s1 + s2 + ... + sn)`, `n`, `l`, `min(m, k)`, `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2) for i from 0 to n-1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
