The code snippet `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` modifies the value of `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, the new value of `c` will be the sum of its previous value and the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `i` must be less than `n`; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`; `k` is `k - s`.**
