The code snippet `k -= s` directly impacts the variable `k` by subtracting the value of `s` from it. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer from input
- `i` is 2
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `k` is `k - s`
- `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`

After executing `k -= s`, the value of `k` is further reduced by `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 2, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**

In simple terms, `k` is now `k - 2 * s`, while the other variables retain their initial values or the values they were updated to before this operation.
