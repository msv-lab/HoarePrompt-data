The function `func` accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` represents the number of sale days, `m` represents the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, and `k` represents the total number of tickets to be bought. Additionally, it accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each integer represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function calculates the optimal way to purchase `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the daily ticket limits and prices, and returns the minimum total cost required to purchase the `k` tickets.
