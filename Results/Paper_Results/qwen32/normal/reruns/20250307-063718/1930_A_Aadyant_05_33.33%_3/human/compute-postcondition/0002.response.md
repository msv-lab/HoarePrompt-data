The only variables in the loop head are `numbers` and `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `int(num)` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `out` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, `num` must be a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `numbers` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0**
