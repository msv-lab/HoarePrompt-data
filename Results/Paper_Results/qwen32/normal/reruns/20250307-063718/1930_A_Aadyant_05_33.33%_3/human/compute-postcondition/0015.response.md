The code appends an additional integer element to `list2`. This element is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `list1[2 * i]` refers to `list1[10]`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]` and now also contains the integer conversion of `list1[8]` and the integer conversion of `list1[10]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user and must be greater than 5; `b` is the string input provided by the user; `i` is 5.**

In simpler terms, `list2` now has an additional element, which is the integer value of `list1[10]`, in addition to the elements it already had. All other variables remain unchanged.
