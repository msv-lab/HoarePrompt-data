Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]` and now also contains the integer conversion of `list1[8]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user; `i` is 4

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]` and now also contains the integer conversion of `list1[8]` and the integer conversion of `list1[10]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user and must be greater than 5; `b` is the string input provided by the user; `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
