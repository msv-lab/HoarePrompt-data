The code snippet `out.append(sum(list2))` adds the sum of the elements in `list2` to the `out` list. Given the initial state, `out` is an empty list, and `list2` contains specific integer conversions from `list1`.

Let's determine the output state step-by-step:

1. `list2` contains integers derived from specific indices of `list1`.
2. The sum of these integers is calculated.
3. This sum is appended to the `out` list.

Since the exact values of `list1` and `list2` are not provided, we can't determine the specific sum. However, we know that `out` will now contain one element, which is the sum of `list2`.

Output State: **`num` remains the same as the initial state; `out` is a list containing one element, the sum of `list2`; `numbers` remains 0; `list2` will contain the integer conversions of `list1[0]`, `list1[4]`, `list1[8]`, ..., `list1[2 * (a - 1)]`; `list1` remains a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` remains the integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` remains the string input provided by the user.**
