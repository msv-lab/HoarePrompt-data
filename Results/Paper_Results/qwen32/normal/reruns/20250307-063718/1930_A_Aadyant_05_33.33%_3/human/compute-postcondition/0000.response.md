The code snippet provided is `num = input()`. This line of code reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `num` is not previously defined, and it will now hold the entire input line as a string.

The initial state mentions that the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line contains a single integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Therefore, `num` will hold this integer `t` as a string.

Other variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`) are not affected by this line of code and remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing the number of test cases `t`. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
