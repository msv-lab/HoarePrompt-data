The code snippet appends an integer value to `list2`. The integer value is obtained by converting the string at index `2 * i` of `list1` to an integer. Since `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order, and `i` is not defined in the given initial state, we need to infer the impact based on the given information.

Given that `list1` is sorted and consists of substrings from `b`, and `2 * i` is used as the index, we can infer that `list2` will have an integer value that corresponds to the integer conversion of the substring at the `2 * i` index of `list1`.

Since `i` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value that will be appended to `list2`. However, we can describe the state after the operation as follows:

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
