The code snippet `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` appends an integer to `list2`. Given that `i` is 4, the code will append the integer conversion of `list1[8]` to `list2`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` contains one additional integer element which is the integer conversion of `list1[2 * i]` and now also contains the integer conversion of `list1[8]`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user; `i` is 4**.

In simpler terms, `list2` now includes an additional element, which is the integer value of `list1[8]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
