The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings wherever there are spaces. Since `b` is the string input provided by the user, `list1` will be a list of the words or numbers in `b` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by spaces; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
