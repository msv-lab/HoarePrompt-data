The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. Since `list1` is a list of substrings from the string `b` split by spaces, sorting `list1` will order these substrings lexicographically.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `num` is still a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1.
- `out` is still an empty list.
- `numbers` is still 0.
- `list2` is still an empty list.
- `list1` is now a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order.
- `a` is still an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user.
- `b` is still the string input provided by the user.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a number that, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 1; `out` is an empty list; `numbers` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` sorted in lexicographical order; `a` is an integer value equal to the integer conversion of the string input provided by the user; `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
