Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `m` < `n` and 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m`, `good_subarrays` is 1, `b_freq` is a Counter object holding the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object holding the frequency of each integer in the sublist `a[:m]`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of integers that are common to both `window_freq` and `b_freq`, and `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `good_subarrays` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
