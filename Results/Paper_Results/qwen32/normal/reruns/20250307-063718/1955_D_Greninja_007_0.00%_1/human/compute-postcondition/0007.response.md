Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `m` < `n` and 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m`, `b_freq` is a Counter object holding the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object holding the frequency of each integer in the sublist `a[:m]`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of integers that are common to both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0.**
