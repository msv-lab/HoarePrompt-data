### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution.

1. **Game Mechanics Analysis:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After possibly swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., who has no coins left in their wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move to ensure their victory.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves. This means that whatever move Alice makes, Bob can make the same move in response, ensuring that Bob will be the last one to make a move and thus win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position. Alice can ensure that Bob is always left with an even number of coins, eventually leading to Bob's inability to make a move.

3. **Solution Analysis:**
   - The provided solution checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob will win.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice will win.

Given the above analysis, the solution correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets. The logic aligns with the optimal play strategy described.
