The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This changes the values of `a` and `b` from being "the two new integers read from the input" to having specific integer values. The other variables (`test` and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed.**
