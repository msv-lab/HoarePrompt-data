### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the total number of coins (sum of coins in both wallets). The key insight is that the game can be analyzed using the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of `a` and `b`.

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **odd**, Alice wins.

2. **Why Parity Matters:**
   - Each turn, a player removes one coin, reducing the total number of coins by one.
   - If the total number of coins is initially even, after an even number of moves (which would be all moves if both play optimally), the total will become zero, and the player who made the last move (Bob, since Alice starts) will be unable to make a move and thus lose.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is initially odd, after an odd number of moves, the total will become zero, and the player who made the last move (Alice) will be unable to make a move and thus lose.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make the move that maximizes their chances of winning. The parity of the total number of coins dictates who can force the game into a losing position for the opponent.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case and printing the appropriate winner based on the parity.
