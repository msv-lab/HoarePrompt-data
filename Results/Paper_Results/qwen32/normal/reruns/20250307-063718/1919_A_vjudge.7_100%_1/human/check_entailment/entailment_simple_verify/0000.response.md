Let's analyze the problem, the provided program, and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The game revolves around the total number of coins in both wallets. The key observation is that:
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, Alice will win.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, Bob will win.

This is because:
- When the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the total number of coins is even on Bob's turn. Since Alice starts, she can ensure that Bob always faces an even number of coins, eventually making Bob unable to make a move.
- Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where the total number of coins is odd on Alice's turn. This means Alice will eventually face an even number of coins and be unable to make a move.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of these coins:
- If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and checks the parity of the sum of coins for each test case.

### Verification of Examples
Let's verify the examples provided in the problem description against the program's logic:
1. **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1` → `a + b = 2` (even) → "Bob"
2. **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4` → `a + b = 5` (odd) → "Alice"
3. **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3` → `a + b = 8` (even) → "Bob"
4. **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5` → `a + b = 9` (odd) → "Alice"
5. **Example 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9` → `a + b = 20` (even) → "Bob"
6. **Example 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91` → `a + b = 174` (even) → "Bob"
7. **Example 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307` → `a + b = 10339` (odd) → "Alice"
8. **Example 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281` → `a + b = 846485` (odd) → "Alice"
9. **Example 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000` → `a + b = 2000000000` (even) → "Bob"
10. **Example 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024` → `a + b = 55134` (even) → "Bob"

All these examples match the expected results based on the game's optimal strategy.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
