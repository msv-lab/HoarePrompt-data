To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution.

The game revolves around two players taking turns to either swap their wallets or keep them, and then removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State and Moves**:
   - Each player starts with a certain number of coins in their respective wallets.
   - On each move, the player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from the current wallet.
   - The game ends when both wallets are empty, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step to ensure their victory.
   - The game can be analyzed by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

3. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice). This means that whatever move Alice makes, Bob can make a corresponding move that keeps the total number of coins even. Eventually, Bob will be the one to make the last move, leading to Alice's loss.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the total number of coins remains odd after her move. This means that Alice can always make the last move, leading to Bob's loss.

### Program Analysis:
The given program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the total number of coins (a + b):
- If the total number of coins is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints 'Bob'.
- If the total number of coins is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

This logic aligns perfectly with the parity analysis above. Therefore, the provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the initial number of coins in both players' wallets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
