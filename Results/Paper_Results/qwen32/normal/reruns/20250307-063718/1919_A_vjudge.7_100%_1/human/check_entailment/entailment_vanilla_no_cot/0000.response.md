To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and compare it with the problem description.

The problem revolves around a game where Alice and Bob take turns playing with their wallets containing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets.

The provided program uses the following logic:
- It checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets (i.e., `a + b`) is even or odd.
- If `a + b` is even, it prints "Bob".
- If `a + b` is odd, it prints "Alice".

Let's verify this logic based on the problem's conditions:

1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, it means that both players will always have an equal number of moves to make before one of them is left with no coins. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, and starting from an even number, it will always alternate between even and odd until it reaches 0 (an even number).
   - If `a + b` is odd, it means that Alice (who starts first) will always have one more move than Bob before one of them is left with no coins. This is because starting from an odd number, it will alternate between odd and even until it reaches 1 (an odd number) and then 0.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob will have the last move and win.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice will have the last move and win.

The program correctly implements this logic using the bitwise AND operation to check the parity of the sum (`a + b & 1`), which is equivalent to checking if the sum is odd (`a + b % 2 == 1`).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
