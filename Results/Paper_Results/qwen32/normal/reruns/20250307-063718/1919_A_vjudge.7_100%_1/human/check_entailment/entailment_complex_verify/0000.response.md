Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game's key insight is that the player who starts with an odd total number of coins will always win if both play optimally, and the player who starts with an even total number of coins will lose if both play optimally. The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` and printing "Alice" if the sum is odd and "Bob" if the sum is even. This aligns with the provided examples and the problem description.

Final: **True**
