Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are still each test case containing two integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(test):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a + b & 1 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` and `b` are the two new integers read from the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
