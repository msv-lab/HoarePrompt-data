Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game for every test case based on the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**: In the game described, the key observation is that the player who starts the game with an odd total number of coins (sum of coins in both wallets) will always win if both players play optimally. Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will win.

2. **Program Logic**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of these coins:
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Example 1**: For `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the sum is `2` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 2**: For `a = 1` and `b = 4`, the sum is `5` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 3**: For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the sum is `8` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 4**: For `a = 4` and `b = 5`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 5**: For `a = 11` and `b = 9`, the sum is `20` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 6**: For `a = 83` and `b = 91`, the sum is `174` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 7**: For `a = 1032` and `b = 9307`, the sum is `10339` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 8**: For `a = 839204` and `b = 7281`, the sum is `846485` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 9**: For `a = 1000000000` and `b = 1000000000`, the sum is `2000000000` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 10**: For `a = 53110` and `b = 2024`, the sum is `55134` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.

Since the program correctly handles the parity check and outputs the correct winner for all provided examples and adheres to the game's optimal strategy, it is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
