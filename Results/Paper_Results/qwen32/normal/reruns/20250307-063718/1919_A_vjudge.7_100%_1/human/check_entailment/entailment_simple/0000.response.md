### Reasoning:
The provided program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win. This strategy is based on the fact that each player will always be able to force the game into a state where the total number of coins changes parity (odd to even or even to odd) with each move, and the game ends when there are no more coins left. Since Alice goes first, if the total number of coins is odd, she can always force Bob into a losing position, and vice versa.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calculates the sum, and checks if the sum is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", otherwise it prints "Alice". This logic correctly implements the winning strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins.
