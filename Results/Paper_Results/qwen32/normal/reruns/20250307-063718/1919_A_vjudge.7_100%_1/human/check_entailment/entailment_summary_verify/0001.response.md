### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key observation that the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner of the game. Here's a detailed breakdown to ensure this reasoning holds:

1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - **Even Total Coins (a + b & 1 == 0)**:
     - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. Since both players play optimally, Bob can ensure that the total number of coins remains even after his turn. Eventually, Bob will make the last valid move, leaving Alice with no valid move. Hence, Bob wins.
   - **Odd Total Coins (a + b & 1 == 1)**:
     - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force the game into a state where the total number of coins remains odd after her move. Alice can ensure that she makes the last valid move, leaving Bob with no valid move. Hence, Alice wins.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks the parity of the total number of coins using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the result is `0`, it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob wins.
   - If the result is `1`, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice wins.

This logic is consistent with the parity analysis described above. Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Final: **True**
