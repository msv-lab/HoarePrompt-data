You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) such test cases.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `test` is 0, `t` is equal to `test - 1` (the last iteration index), and all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the program has printed either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` was even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution.

The game revolves around two players taking turns to either swap their wallets or keep them, and then removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State and Moves**:
   - Each player starts with a certain number of coins in their respective wallets.
   - On each move, the player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from the current wallet.
   - The game ends when both wallets are empty, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step to ensure their victory.
   - The game can be analyzed by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

3. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice). This means that whatever move Alice makes, Bob can make a corresponding move that keeps the total number of coins even. Eventually, Bob will be the one to make the last move, leading to Alice's loss.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the total number of coins remains odd after her move. This means that Alice can always make the last move, leading to Bob's loss.

### Program Analysis:
The given program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the total number of coins (a + b):
- If the total number of coins is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints 'Bob'.
- If the total number of coins is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

This logic aligns perfectly with the parity analysis above. Therefore, the provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the initial number of coins in both players' wallets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
