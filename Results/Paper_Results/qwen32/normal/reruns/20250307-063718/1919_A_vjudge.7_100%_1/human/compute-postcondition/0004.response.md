Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `test` is greater than 0.
2. `t` is 0.
3. `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
4. The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `test`, `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Output:
Output: **Bob**
