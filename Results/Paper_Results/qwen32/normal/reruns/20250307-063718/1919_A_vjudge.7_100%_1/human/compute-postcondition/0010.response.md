The `print('Bob')` statement simply prints the string 'Bob' to the console. The initial state describes several variables (`test`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and the sum of `a` and `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Bob**
