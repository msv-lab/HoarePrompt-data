The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `test`. If `t` is less than `test`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `test` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`test` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` and `b` are the two new integers read from the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed.**
