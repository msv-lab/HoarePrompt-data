You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5
    
    11 9
    
    83 91
    
    1032 9307
    
    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game for every test case based on the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**: In the game described, the key observation is that the player who starts the game with an odd total number of coins (sum of coins in both wallets) will always win if both players play optimally. Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will win.

2. **Program Logic**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of these coins:
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Example 1**: For `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the sum is `2` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 2**: For `a = 1` and `b = 4`, the sum is `5` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 3**: For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the sum is `8` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 4**: For `a = 4` and `b = 5`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 5**: For `a = 11` and `b = 9`, the sum is `20` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 6**: For `a = 83` and `b = 91`, the sum is `174` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 7**: For `a = 1032` and `b = 9307`, the sum is `10339` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 8**: For `a = 839204` and `b = 7281`, the sum is `846485` (odd), so the output is "Alice". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 9**: For `a = 1000000000` and `b = 1000000000`, the sum is `2000000000` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.
   - **Example 10**: For `a = 53110` and `b = 2024`, the sum is `55134` (even), so the output is "Bob". This matches the problem description.

Since the program correctly handles the parity check and outputs the correct winner for all provided examples and adheres to the game's optimal strategy, it is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
