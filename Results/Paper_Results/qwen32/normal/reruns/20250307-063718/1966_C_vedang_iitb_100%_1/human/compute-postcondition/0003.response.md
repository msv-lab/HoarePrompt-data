The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer.**
