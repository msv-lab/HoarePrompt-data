To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for sz in a:`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers and `sz` is the loop variable.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Loop Variable (`sz`)**: This variable will take on each value in the list `a` during each iteration of the loop. The initial value of `sz` is not something we can set directly, but we can ensure that `a` has at least one element so that `sz` can take on a value and the loop can execute.

2. **List `a`**: The loop will execute if and only if `a` has at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `mexsize` is 1.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is the list `a` to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element.

**State Adjustment**:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must contain at least one element.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, but they must be consistent with the presence of at least one element in `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `a` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1**.
