The code snippet provided is:
```python
mexsize = 1
```

This line of code assigns the value `1` to the variable `mexsize`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`; `mexsize` is 1.**
