Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` after the loop, and `tc` is incremented by 1. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
