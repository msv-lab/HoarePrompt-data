The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `sz` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements.
- `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `sz` is the second-to-last element of the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is updated to 3 if `sz` originally equals `mexsize`; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.

Since `sz` is the current element being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `sz` should be the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` was the second-to-last element, the next element would be the last element of the list `a`.

Therefore, `sz` should be updated to `maxsize`, which is the last element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. If `sz` originally equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
