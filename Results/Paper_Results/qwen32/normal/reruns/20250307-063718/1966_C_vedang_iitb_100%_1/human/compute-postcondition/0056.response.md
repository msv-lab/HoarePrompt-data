Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `mexsize` is either 2 or 3 based on the previous conditions, `sz` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The only variable that changes is `mexsize`, which is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `mexsize` was 1, it becomes 2, and if `mexsize` was 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
