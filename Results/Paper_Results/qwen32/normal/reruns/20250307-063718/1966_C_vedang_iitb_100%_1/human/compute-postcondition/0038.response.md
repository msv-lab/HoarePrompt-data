Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1, making `mexsize` now `mexsize + 1`. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.**
