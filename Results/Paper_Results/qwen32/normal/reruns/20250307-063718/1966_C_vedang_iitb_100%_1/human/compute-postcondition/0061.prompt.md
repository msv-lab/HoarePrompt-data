Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the newly input sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, and `tc` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1. If the current size of the list `a` (denoted as `sz`) is equal to the previous `mexsize` (which is 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `mexsize` is either 1 or 3 based on the previous conditions, `sz` is the last element of `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 or 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to either 2 or 4. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
