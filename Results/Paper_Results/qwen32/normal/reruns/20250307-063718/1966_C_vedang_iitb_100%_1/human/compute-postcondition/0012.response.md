The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the second-to-last element of the list `a`, `mexsize` is 3 if `sz` originally equals 2; otherwise, `mexsize` is 2.**
