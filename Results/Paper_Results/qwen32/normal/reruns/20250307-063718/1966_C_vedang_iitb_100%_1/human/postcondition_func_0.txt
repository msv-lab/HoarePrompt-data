The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers representing the number of stones in piles. For each test case, it determines the smallest positive integer not present in the list (mexsize) and compares it to the maximum value in the list (maxsize). It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the parity of mexsize relative to maxsize.
