The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` is already described as a sorted list of integers in the initial state, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the list `a` remains the same. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the newly input sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`, and `tc` is incremented by 1.**
