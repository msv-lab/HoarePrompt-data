To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. For each element, it checks if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`. If it is, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This process continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, after all iterations, `mexsize` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `a`. This is because `mexsize` starts at 1 and increments each time it finds an element in `a` that matches its current value.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains the number of test cases.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `a` remains the sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `tc` is incremented by 1 for each test case, but since we are focusing on the state after a single test case's loop, `tc` is incremented by 1.
- `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
