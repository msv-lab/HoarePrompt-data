Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The logic used in the program does not align with the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) strategy, which is the correct approach for solving this type of combinatorial game.

Here's a brief explanation of the correct approach:

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner is the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if both play optimally. Otherwise, the player is in a winning position.

Here's a correct implementation based on this strategy:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This implementation calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins as Alice is in a losing position. Otherwise, Alice wins.
