In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and `t`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

Given that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and it is already defined as `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `tc` is the loop variable that will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop.

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `tc` will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration, so no adjustment is needed for `tc` either.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient to ensure that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
