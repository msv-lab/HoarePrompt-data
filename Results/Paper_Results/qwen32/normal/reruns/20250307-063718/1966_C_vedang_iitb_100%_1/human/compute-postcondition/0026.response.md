The code snippet updates the value of `maxsize` to be the maximum value in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the new list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1**.
