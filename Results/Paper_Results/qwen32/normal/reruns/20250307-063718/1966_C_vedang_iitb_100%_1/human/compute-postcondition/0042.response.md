Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
