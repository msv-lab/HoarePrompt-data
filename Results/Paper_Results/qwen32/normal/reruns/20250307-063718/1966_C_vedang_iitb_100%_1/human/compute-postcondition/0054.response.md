Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1. If the current size of the list `a` (denoted as `sz`) is equal to the previous `mexsize` (which is 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
