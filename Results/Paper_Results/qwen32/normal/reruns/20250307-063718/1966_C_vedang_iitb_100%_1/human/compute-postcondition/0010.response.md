Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is 2 if `sz` equals `mexsize`; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
