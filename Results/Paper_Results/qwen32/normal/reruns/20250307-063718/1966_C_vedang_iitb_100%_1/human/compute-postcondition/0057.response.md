Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `mexsize` is either 1 or 3 based on the previous conditions, `sz` is the last element of `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 or 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1 or 2.**
