To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` after the loop.
- `tc` is incremented by 1.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

To determine the output, we need to know the value of `mexsize`. `mexsize` is described as the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`. The print statement checks if `mexsize` is odd or even and prints 'Alice' if it is odd, and 'Bob' if it is even.

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `mexsize`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If `mexsize` is an odd number, the output will be 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is an even number, the output will be 'Bob'.

Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it could be any positive integer starting from 1, but its parity (odd or even) will determine the output.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
