The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `a` contains at least one element. The values of `sz`, `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc` do not need to be changed to satisfy the loop execution condition.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is incremented by 1**
