### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the minimum excludant (mex) of the pile sizes. However, the logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The mex of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The logic in the program seems to be trying to determine the mex of the pile sizes but is incorrectly using this value to determine the winner.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the winning strategy depends on the XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) can always force a win with optimal play. Otherwise, the first player (Alice) can force a win.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to compute the XOR of all pile sizes for each test case and determine the winner based on whether the XOR is zero or not.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect logic for determining the winner, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
