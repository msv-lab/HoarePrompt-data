The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Since `mexsize` was initially 1, after the operation, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `tc`, and `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, `tc` is incremented by 1, and the current size of the list `a` (denoted as `sz`) is equal to the previous `mexsize` (which is 1)**.
