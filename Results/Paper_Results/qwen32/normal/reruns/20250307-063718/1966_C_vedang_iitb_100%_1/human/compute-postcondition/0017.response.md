To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. It checks if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`. If it is, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This means `mexsize` will keep increasing as long as the elements in `a` are consecutive integers starting from 1.

The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been checked. Therefore, the final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.

Given the information about the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration: `mexsize` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 1.
- After the second iteration: `mexsize` is 3 if the second element of `a` is 2.
- After the third iteration: `mexsize` is 4 if the third element of `a` is 3.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, `mexsize` will be equal to the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
