The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, `tc`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`, and `tc` is incremented by 1.**
