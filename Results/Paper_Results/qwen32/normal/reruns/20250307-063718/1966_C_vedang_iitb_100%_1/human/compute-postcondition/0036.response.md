The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sz` is the current element being processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` must be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

Since `sz` is the current element being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `sz` should be the next element in the list `a`. Given that the list `a` is sorted and has at least one element, and `sz` has just been processed, the next `sz` should logically be the subsequent element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

To be more precise, if `sz` was the `k`-th element in the list `a` during the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `sz` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

Since the exact next element in the list `a` after the current `sz` isn't specified in the problem statement, we'll just denote it as the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**
