To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the `mexsize` variable evolves based on the sorted list `a`.

The `mexsize` variable starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time it finds an element in `a` that matches its current value. Since `a` is sorted, the loop will increment `mexsize` for each consecutive integer starting from 1 that it encounters in the list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the final state:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - `mexsize` starts at 1.
   - `tc` is incremented by 1 (indicating the start of a new test case).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `sz` in `a`.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
   - If `sz` does not equal `mexsize`, `mexsize` remains unchanged.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `tc` remain unchanged except for `mexsize`.

Given the loop's behavior, the final `mexsize` will be the smallest integer greater than the largest consecutive sequence of integers starting from 1 found in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` after the loop, and `tc` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `mexsize` will be the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted list `a`.
