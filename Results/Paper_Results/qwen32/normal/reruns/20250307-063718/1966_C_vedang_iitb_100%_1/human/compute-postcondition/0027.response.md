The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This affects the list `a` by reordering its elements. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the new list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
