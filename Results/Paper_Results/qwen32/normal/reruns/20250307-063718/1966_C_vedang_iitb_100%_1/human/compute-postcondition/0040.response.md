Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`, and the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. `tc` is incremented by 1.**
