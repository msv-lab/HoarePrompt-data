The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` with new values from the input. This means that the previous values of `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` are no longer valid and need to be recalculated based on the new input.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the last element of the new sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the new list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1**.
