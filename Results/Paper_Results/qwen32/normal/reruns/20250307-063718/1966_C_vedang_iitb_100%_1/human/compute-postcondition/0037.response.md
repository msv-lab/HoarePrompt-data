The code snippet provided increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `tc`, and `sz`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1, and `mexsize` is now `mexsize + 1`.**
