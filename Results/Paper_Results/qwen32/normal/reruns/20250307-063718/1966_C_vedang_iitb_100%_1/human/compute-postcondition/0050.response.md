Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the newly input sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, and `tc` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `mexsize` has been explicitly set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
