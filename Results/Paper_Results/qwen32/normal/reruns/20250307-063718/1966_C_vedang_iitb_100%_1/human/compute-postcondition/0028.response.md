The variable `mexsize` is explicitly set to 1. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `tc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
