#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        maxsize = max(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        mexsize = 1
        
        for sz in a:
            if sz == mexsize:
                mexsize = mexsize + 1
        
        if mexsize > maxsize:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` iterations have been completed, and for each iteration, the program has processed an input integer `n` representing the number of piles, a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, determined `maxsize` as the maximum value in the list, calculated `mexsize` as the smallest positive integer not present in the list, and printed 'Alice' if `mexsize % 2 == 0` when `mexsize > maxsize` or `mexsize % 2 == 1` when `mexsize <= maxsize`, and 'Bob' otherwise. The variable `tc` has been incremented to `t`, and no further test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers representing the number of stones in piles. For each test case, it determines the smallest positive integer not present in the list (mexsize) and compares it to the maximum value in the list (maxsize). It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the parity of mexsize relative to maxsize.
