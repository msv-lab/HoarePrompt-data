The code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given the initial state, `mexsize` is initially 1. After executing the code, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, `tc` is incremented by 1, and `sz` equals `mexsize`.**
