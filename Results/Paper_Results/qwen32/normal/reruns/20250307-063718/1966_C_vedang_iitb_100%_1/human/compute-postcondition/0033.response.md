The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the last element of the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` to be assigned to `sz`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and must have at least 1 element, and `tc` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust `sz` to the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration. However, since we don't have information about the specific elements in the list `a` other than the fact that it is sorted and has at least one element, we can assume that `sz` will take the next value in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the last iteration. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `sz` from the last iteration or the next value in the list, we can represent the state as follows, assuming `sz` will take the next value in the list `a`:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is determined based on the value of `sz`.**

However, to strictly adhere to the given format and only adjust the loop head variable `sz`:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**

Since we need to strictly adjust only the loop head variable `sz`, the final state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
