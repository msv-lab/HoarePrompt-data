Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The input for the number of piles `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case is still pending.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, representing the number of test cases. The conditions on `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) remain valid. The remaining input (number of piles `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case) has not yet been processed and thus remains as described in the initial state.
