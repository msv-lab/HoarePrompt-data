Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Additionally, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
