The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which represents the current test case index. The loop iterates over the range of `t` (the number of test cases). Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `tc` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`

The state of `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` does not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and are specific to the current test case.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is some value `k` where `0 ≤ k < t`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`.
3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1**
