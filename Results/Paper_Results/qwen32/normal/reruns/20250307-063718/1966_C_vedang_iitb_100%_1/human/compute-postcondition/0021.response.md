To determine the output of the given code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: the number of test cases.
   - `n`: an input integer (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `a`: a sorted list of integers.
   - `maxsize`: the last element of the sorted list `a` (i.e., the maximum element in `a`).
   - `mexsize`: the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Condition in the print statement:**
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 1` (i.e., if `mexsize` is an odd number).
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we can't determine whether `mexsize` is odd or even. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

**Explanation:**
- If `mexsize` is an odd number, the output will be 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is an even number, the output will be 'Bob'.

Given this, the output of the code snippet can be described as follows:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`)**
