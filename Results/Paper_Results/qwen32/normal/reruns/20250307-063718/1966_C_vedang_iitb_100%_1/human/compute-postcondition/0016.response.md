Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. If `sz` originally equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 4; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
