The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `t`, `n`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged. Since `a` is sorted, `maxsize` will now be the last element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.**
