Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to either 2 or 4. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
