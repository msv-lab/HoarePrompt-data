The code snippet provided increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `mexsize` is either 1 or 3, after the increment, `mexsize` will be either 2 or 4, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a newly input sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `mexsize` is either 2 or 4, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
