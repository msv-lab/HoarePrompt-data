The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Initially, `mexsize` is 1, so after the operation, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and `sz` is equal to `mexsize` (which is 1)**

However, since `sz` is initially set to `mexsize` (which is 1), and `mexsize` is now 2, we need to update `sz` to reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and `sz` is 2**
