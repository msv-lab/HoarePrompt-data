### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed using the formula \( a_{k,h} = a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) where \( a_{1,1} \) is the minimum value in the array, and \( k, h \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and an array \( b \) of \( n^2 \) integers, determine if \( b \) can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

#### Program Code Recap:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

#### Annotations Recap:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list \( l \).
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. Inside `func_1`, the minimum value \( a \) is determined from \( l \).
5. The list `li` is constructed using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k, h \) in the range \( [0, n-1] \).
6. Both `li` and \( l \) are sorted.
7. The sorted lists are compared, and the function returns "yes" if they match, otherwise "no".

#### Evaluation:
1. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The program correctly identifies \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the list \( l \).
   - It constructs the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting both `li` and \( l \) ensures that the comparison is order-independent, which is correct since the order of elements in \( l \) is not specified.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The comparison between the sorted lists `l` and `li` correctly determines if the input array can form the progressive square.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description (e.g., \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and \( 1 \le b_i \le 10^9 \)).
   - The sum of \( n^2 \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 25 \cdot 10^4 \), which the program can handle efficiently.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules and input constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
