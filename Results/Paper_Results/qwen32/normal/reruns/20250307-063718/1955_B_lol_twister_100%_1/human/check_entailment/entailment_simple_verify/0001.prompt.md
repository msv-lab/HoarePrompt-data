You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the rules for constructing the progressive square and checking the given array.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the values `c` and `d`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program identifies the minimum value `a` from the array `l`.
   - It constructs a list `li` of the expected values in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the square.
   - The list `li` is then sorted.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The array `l` is sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted array `l` matches the sorted list `li` of expected values.
   - If they match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square based on the given rules.
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting both the constructed list `li` and the input array `l` ensures that the comparison is based on the same order.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The comparison between the sorted lists `l` and `li` correctly determines if the input array can form the progressive square.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules and input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
