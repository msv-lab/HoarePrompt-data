The only variable in the loop head is `h`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `h` is in the range from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented by `1`.

Let's break down the state adjustments required:

- `h` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `h` is incremented by `1` at the start of each iteration, `h` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, `k`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and now also includes `a + (n-2) * c + d`, `h` is 2, `k` is `n-2`. `li` has an additional element `a + (n-2) * c + d` appended to it.**
