The only variable in the loop head is `h`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h` and the range specified, which is from 0 to `n-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0, and the loop will execute as long as `h` is less than `n`. After the first iteration, `h` would have been incremented to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 1 (if it was 0 before), 2 (if it was 1 before), and so on, up to `n-1`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration has `h` as 0, for the next iteration, `h` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing the single element `a + k * c`; `h` is 1**
