The code snippet provided appends a new value to the list `li`. The value appended is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k` is `n-1`, and `h` is `1`.

Given the initial state, `li` already contains:
- Elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`
- Elements `a + (n-2) * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`
- The element `a + (n-1) * (c + d)`
- The element `a + (n-1) * c`

The new value being appended is `a + k * c + d * h`, which translates to `a + (n-1) * c + d * 1` or `a + (n-1) * c + d`.

Therefore, the list `li` will now include this new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `a + (n-2) * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `a + (n-1) * (c + d)`, `a + (n-1) * c`, and `a + (n-1) * c + d`, `h` is 1, `k` is `n-1`**.
