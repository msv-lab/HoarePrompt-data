### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the logic.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n * n` integers.
   - This part is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program identifies `a` as the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs the list `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the square.
   - This aligns with the problem description, where `a` is `a_{1,1}`, and the values are generated using the given formula.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The constructed list `li` and the input array `l` are both sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted `l` matches the sorted `li`.
   - This ensures that the program correctly verifies if the input array can form the progressive square.

### Verification of Logic:

- **Progressive Square Construction:**
  - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square, as per the problem description.
  - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as `a_{1,1}`.

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting both `li` and `l` ensures that the comparison is based on the same order, which is necessary because the elements in the input array `l` are in random order.

- **Comparison:**
  - The comparison between the sorted lists `l` and `li` correctly determines if the input array can form the progressive square.

### Annotations Analysis:

- The annotations confirm that the minimum value `a` is correctly identified from the list `l`.
- The list `li` is correctly constructed using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all positions `(k, h)`.
- Both `li` and `l` are sorted before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules and input constraints. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each step.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
