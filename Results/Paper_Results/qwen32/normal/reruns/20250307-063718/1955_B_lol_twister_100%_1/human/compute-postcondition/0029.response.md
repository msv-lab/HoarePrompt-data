Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and for `k` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `h` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, and the list `l` is equal to the list `li`.**
