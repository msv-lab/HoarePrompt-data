To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed using three integers \( a_{1,1} \), \( c \), and \( d \).
- The element at position \( (i, j) \) in the matrix is calculated as: \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \times c + (j-1) \times d \).
- Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and an array \( b \) of \( n^2 \) integers, determine if \( b \) can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It also reads the list \( b \) of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Logic to Determine Progressive Square:**
   - The program identifies the minimum element \( a \) in the list \( b \).
   - It constructs the progressive square \( li \) using the formula \( a + k \times c + d \times h \) for each position \( (k, h) \) in the matrix.
   - It sorts both the constructed list \( li \) and the input list \( b \).
   - If the sorted lists are equal, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program assumes that the minimum element in \( b \) is \( a_{1,1} \). However, the problem description does not specify that \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest element in the progressive square. \( a_{1,1} \) is a starting point, and the actual values in the square depend on \( c \) and \( d \).
- The program should correctly deduce \( a_{1,1} \) from the given \( c \) and \( d \) and the list \( b \). It should not simply assume that the minimum element in \( b \) is \( a_{1,1} \).

### Correct Approach:
- The program should generate all possible progressive squares for the given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \) and check if any of these squares can be formed by rearranging the elements of \( b \).
- Alternatively, it should correctly deduce \( a_{1,1} \) by analyzing the differences between elements in \( b \) based on the pattern defined by \( c \) and \( d \).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, it is incorrect as it does not correctly deduce the starting element \( a_{1,1} \) and assumes the minimum element in \( b \) is always \( a_{1,1} \).

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
