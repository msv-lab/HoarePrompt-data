The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `h`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `h` for the next iteration. According to the loop, `h` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` was `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` would need to be reset to `0` because the loop will terminate if `h` is equal to `n`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and now also includes `a + (n-2) * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and `a + (n-1) * (c + d)`, `h` is 0, `k` is `n-1`**
