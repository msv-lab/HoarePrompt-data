### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific pattern defined by the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The function `func_1` determines the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then generates a list `li` of `n^2` elements using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`. If they match, it means the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Verification:
The logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. The progressive square is uniquely determined by `n`, `c`, `d`, and the minimum value `a` in the list. By generating the elements of the progressive square and comparing them to the sorted input list, the program accurately determines if the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the described logic and handles the problem requirements as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
