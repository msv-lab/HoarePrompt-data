The only variable in the loop head is `h`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 1, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

Since `h` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `h` should be 2 (assuming the loop has just completed its first iteration with `h` equal to 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d * h`; `h` is 2**
