### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program code, along with the function summary, to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A progressive square of size `n` is an `n x n` matrix constructed based on the values `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`.
- The value at position `(k, h)` in the matrix is given by the formula `a_{1,1} + k * c + d * h`.
- Given `n`, `c`, `d`, and an array `b` of `n^2` integers, the task is to determine if `b` can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, `d`, and the array `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program identifies `a` as the minimum value in `l`, which is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.
   - It constructs a list `li` of expected values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the square.
   - The list `li` is sorted.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The array `l` is sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted array `l` matches the sorted list `li` of expected values.
   - If they match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as parameters.
- It returns 'yes' if the list `l` can be rearranged to match the sequence generated by the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`, where `a` is the minimum value in `l`.
- Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

#### Verification of Logic:
1. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square.
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting both the constructed list `li` and the input array `l` ensures that the comparison is based on the same order.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The comparison between the sorted lists `l` and `li` correctly determines if the input array can form the progressive square.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules and input constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
