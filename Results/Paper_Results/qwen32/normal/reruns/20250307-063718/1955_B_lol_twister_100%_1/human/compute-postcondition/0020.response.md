The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k` is `n-1`, and `h` is also `n-1`.

Given these values, the new element to be appended is `a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-1)`, which simplifies to `a + (n-1) * (c + d)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `h` remain unchanged. Only `li` is updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and now also includes `a + (n-2) * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and `a + (n-1) * (c + d)`, `h` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`**
