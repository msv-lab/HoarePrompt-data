You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Progressive Square Construction**: A progressive square of size `n` is constructed using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d` for `1 <= i, j <= n`.
- **Verification**: Given `n`, `c`, `d`, and an array `b` of `n*n` integers, determine if `b` can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The program starts by finding the minimum element in the array `l` and assumes that this element is `a_{1,1}`. This is a reasonable assumption since `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program then generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d` and stores them in a list `li`.
3. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the generated list `li` and the input array `l` are sorted and then compared. If they are identical, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Correctness of `a_{1,1}`**: The assumption that the minimum element in the array is `a_{1,1}` is generally correct because `a_{1,1}` is indeed the smallest element in the progressive square. However, we need to ensure that no other element in the array can be `a_{1,1}` and still satisfy the progressive square conditions.
- **Uniqueness of Elements**: The program assumes that the elements in the array are unique, but the problem does not guarantee this. If there are duplicate elements, the program might incorrectly identify the smallest element.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as the smallest element not being `a_{1,1}` due to the specific values of `c` and `d`.

### Test Case to Verify:
Let's consider a test case where the smallest element is not `a_{1,1}`:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'yes'` (Correct)

However, consider another test case:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[5, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[5, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'yes'` (Correct)

But if we change the input slightly:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[3, 5, 3, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 3, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'no'` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where the smallest element in the array is not `a_{1,1}` and there are duplicate elements. This can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The program assumes that the smallest element in the array is `a_{1,1}` and does not handle cases where this assumption might be incorrect due to duplicate elements or specific values of `c` and `d`.
