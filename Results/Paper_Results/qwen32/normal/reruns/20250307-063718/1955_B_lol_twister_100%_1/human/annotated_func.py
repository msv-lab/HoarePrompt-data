#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and for `k` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `h` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the size of a matrix), `c` and `d` (integers), and `l` (a list of `n^2` integers representing the elements of the matrix). It returns 'yes' if the list `l` can be rearranged to match the sequence generated by the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`, where `a` is the minimum value in `l`. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
