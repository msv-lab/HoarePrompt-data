The only variable in the loop head is `h`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h` and it will continue to execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `h` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, `k`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and now also includes `a + (n-2) * c`, `h` is 1, `k` is `n-2`**
