To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it appends a new element to the list `li`. The element appended in the `h`-th iteration is `a + k * c + d * h`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize the final state after `n` iterations.

The loop runs from `h = 0` to `h = n-1`. Therefore, after `n` iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements, which are:
- `a + k * c + d * 0`
- `a + k * c + d * 1`
- `a + k * c + d * 2`
- ...
- `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`

Thus, the final state of `li` will be a list of `n` elements where the `h`-th element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

The value of `h` after the loop finishes will be `n-1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`; `h` is `n-1`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` from `0` to `n-1`, and `h` itself will be `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
