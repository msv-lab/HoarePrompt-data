To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the rules for constructing the progressive square and checking the given array.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the values `c` and `d`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program identifies the minimum value `a` from the array `l`.
   - It constructs a list `li` of the expected values in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the square.
   - The list `li` is then sorted.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The array `l` is sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted array `l` matches the sorted list `li` of expected values.
   - If they match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square based on the given rules.
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting both the constructed list `li` and the input array `l` ensures that the comparison is based on the same order.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The comparison between the sorted lists `l` and `li` correctly determines if the input array can form the progressive square.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules and input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
