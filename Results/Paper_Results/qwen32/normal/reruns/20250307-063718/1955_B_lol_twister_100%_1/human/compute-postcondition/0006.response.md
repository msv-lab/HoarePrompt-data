Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing the elements `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d * h`; `h` is 1**

Explanation: The list `li` initially contains one element `a + k * c`. After executing the code snippet, another element `a + k * c + d * h` is appended to `li`. The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `h` remain unchanged.
