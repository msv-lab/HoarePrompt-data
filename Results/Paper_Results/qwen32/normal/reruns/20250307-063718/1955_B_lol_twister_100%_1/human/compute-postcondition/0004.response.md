The code snippet appends a new value to the list `li`. The value being appended is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k` is not defined in the initial state, `c` and `d` are integers, and `h` is 0. Since `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains one element, which is `a + k * c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing the single element `a + k * c`; `h` is 0**.
