### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a progressive square matrix based on specific rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by a list of `n * n` integers `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Determine the Minimum Value:** The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - **Generate Progressive Square Values:** It generates a list `li` of size `n * n` containing values according to the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Sorting:** Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - **Comparison:** The program checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`. If they match, it means `l` can form the progressive square, and it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Minimum Value:** The program correctly identifies the minimum value `a` in the list `l`, which is used as the starting point for generating the progressive square.
   - **Progressive Square Generation:** The formula `a + k * c + d * h` is used to generate the elements of the progressive square. This formula ensures that each element is calculated based on its position `(k, h)` in the matrix.
   - **Sorting and Comparison:** By sorting both `l` and `li`, the program ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison. If the sorted lists match, it confirms that `l` contains exactly the elements of the progressive square in any order.
   - **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where the lists do not match by returning "NO", ensuring it correctly identifies invalid progressive squares.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given list of integers can form a progressive square matrix based on the provided rules. The steps taken by the program are logically sound and correctly address the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
