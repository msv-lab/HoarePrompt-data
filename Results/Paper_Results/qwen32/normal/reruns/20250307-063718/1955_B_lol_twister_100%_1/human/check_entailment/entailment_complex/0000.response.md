### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The program identifies the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs the expected values for the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This is done in a nested loop that iterates over `k` and `h`.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The constructed list `li` is sorted.
   - The input list `l` is also sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct response for each test case based on the comparison.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can be rearranged to form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
