Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Progressive Square Construction**: A progressive square of size `n` is constructed using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d` for `1 <= i, j <= n`.
- **Verification**: Given `n`, `c`, `d`, and an array `b` of `n*n` integers, determine if `b` can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The program starts by finding the minimum element in the array `l` and assumes that this element is `a_{1,1}`. This is a reasonable assumption since `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program then generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d` and stores them in a list `li`.
3. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the generated list `li` and the input array `l` are sorted and then compared. If they are identical, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Correctness of `a_{1,1}`**: The assumption that the minimum element in the array is `a_{1,1}` is generally correct because `a_{1,1}` is indeed the smallest element in the progressive square. However, we need to ensure that no other element in the array can be `a_{1,1}` and still satisfy the progressive square conditions.
- **Uniqueness of Elements**: The program assumes that the elements in the array are unique, but the problem does not guarantee this. If there are duplicate elements, the program might incorrectly identify the smallest element.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as the smallest element not being `a_{1,1}` due to the specific values of `c` and `d`.

### Test Case to Verify:
Let's consider a test case where the smallest element is not `a_{1,1}`:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'yes'` (Correct)

However, consider another test case:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[5, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[5, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'yes'` (Correct)

But if we change the input slightly:
- **Input**: `n=2`, `c=1`, `d=2`, `b=[3, 5, 3, 6]`
  - Progressive square: `a_{1,1} = 3`, `a_{1,2} = 5`, `a_{2,1} = 4`, `a_{2,2} = 6`
  - Generated list: `[3, 5, 4, 6]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Sorted input: `[3, 3, 5, 6]`
  - Output: `'no'` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where the smallest element in the array is not `a_{1,1}` and there are duplicate elements. This can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The program assumes that the smallest element in the array is `a_{1,1}` and does not handle cases where this assumption might be incorrect due to duplicate elements or specific values of `c` and `d`.
