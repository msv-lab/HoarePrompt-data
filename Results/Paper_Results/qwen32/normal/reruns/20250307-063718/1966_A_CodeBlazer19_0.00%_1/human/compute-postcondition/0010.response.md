The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**

Natural language: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.
