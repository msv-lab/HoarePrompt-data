The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. It does not affect any other variables or perform any operations related to the test cases themselves. Therefore, the only change is that the variable `t` now holds the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list of integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` for each test case remain unknown and unchanged.**
