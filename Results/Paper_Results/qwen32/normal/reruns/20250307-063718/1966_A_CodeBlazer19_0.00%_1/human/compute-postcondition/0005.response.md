The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
