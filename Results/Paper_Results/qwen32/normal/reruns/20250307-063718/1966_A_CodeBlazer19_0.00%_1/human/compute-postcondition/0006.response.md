The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, but the code snippet overwrites these variables with new values from the input. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Since the values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` now hold the values read from the input during the execution of the code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
