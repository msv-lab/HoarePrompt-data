The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and k (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), where n is the number of cards and k is the number of cards exchanged during each operation. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), representing the numbers written on the cards. The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
