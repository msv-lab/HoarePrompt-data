The provided code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `l`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The variable `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.

Since the code snippet only affects the variable `l`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new value of `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**
