The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. These conditions remain unchanged. The new variables `n` and `k` are introduced and assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
