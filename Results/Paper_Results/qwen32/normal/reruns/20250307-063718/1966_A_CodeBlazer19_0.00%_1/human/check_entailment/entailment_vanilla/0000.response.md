Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program reads the input values for each test case but always outputs `k - 1` regardless of the actual card numbers or the number of cards. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations depends on the frequency of each card number in the hand.

To determine the correct minimum number of cards:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. For each group of `k` cards, replace them with `k-1` cards, which effectively reduces the count by 1.
4. Sum up the remaining counts of cards after performing the operations for each unique card number.

The provided program does not perform these steps and instead gives a constant output of `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
