The code reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
