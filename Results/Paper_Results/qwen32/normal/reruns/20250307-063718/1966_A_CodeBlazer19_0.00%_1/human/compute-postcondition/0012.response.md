In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

The variable `k` is an integer read from the input, and the print statement will output the value of `k - 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the precondition, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
