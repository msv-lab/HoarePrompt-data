Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `l` is a list of integers read from the input during the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value `t-1`, which is the last index of the range specified by the number of test cases `t`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` will hold the values that were read during the last iteration of the loop. The value of `t` will remain unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
