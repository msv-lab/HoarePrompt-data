You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and k (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), where n is the number of cards and k is the number of cards exchanged during each operation. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), representing the numbers written on the cards. The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `l` is a list of integers read from the input during the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the given operations. The current implementation always prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect for most scenarios.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We start with 5 cards: `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`.
- We can choose 3 cards with the number 4 and exchange them for 2 cards, which can be any numbers. Let's choose to exchange them for 2 cards with the number 1. Now we have 4 cards: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- We can choose 3 cards with the number 1 and exchange them for 2 cards, which can be any numbers. Let's choose to exchange them for 2 cards with the number 4. Now we have 3 cards: `[1, 4, 4]`.
- We can choose 2 cards with the number 4 and exchange them for 1 card, which can be any number. Let's choose to exchange them for 1 card with the number 1. Now we have 2 cards: `[1, 1]`.
- We cannot perform any more operations because we don't have `k=3` cards with the same number.

Thus, the minimum number of cards left is 2.

However, the given program will output `3 - 1 = 2` for this case, which is correct by coincidence but not because of the logic implemented. The program does not actually simulate the process of exchanging cards based on the given rules. Instead, it just outputs `k - 1` for every test case, which is incorrect for cases where the number of cards cannot be reduced to `k - 1` through the described operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem requirements properly for all potential cases.
