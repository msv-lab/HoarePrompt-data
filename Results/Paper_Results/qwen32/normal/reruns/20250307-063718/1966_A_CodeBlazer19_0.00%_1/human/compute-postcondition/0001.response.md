The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list of integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` for each test case are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
