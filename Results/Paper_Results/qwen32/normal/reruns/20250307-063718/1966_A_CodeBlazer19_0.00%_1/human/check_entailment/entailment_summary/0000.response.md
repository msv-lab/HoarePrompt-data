Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values of `n`, `k`, or the list of card numbers. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left depends on the frequency of the card numbers and the value of `k`.

For example, in the first test case, we have `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the card numbers are `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`. The optimal sequence of operations can reduce the number of cards to 2, not `k - 1 = 2` (which is coincidentally correct in this case but not generally). In the second test case, with `n = 1` and `k = 10`, the answer should be `1` because no operations can be performed, but the program outputs `k - 1 = 9`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach involves counting the frequency of each card number, determining how many groups of `k` cards can be formed for each number, and calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

Correctness: **False**
