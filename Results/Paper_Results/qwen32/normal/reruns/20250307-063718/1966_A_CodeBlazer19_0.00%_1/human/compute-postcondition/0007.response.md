The code snippet provided is `l = list(map(int, input().split()))`. This line reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. 

Given the initial state, `l` is a list of integers read from the input. After executing the code snippet, `l` will be reassigned to a new list of integers read from the input, replacing the original value of `l`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**
