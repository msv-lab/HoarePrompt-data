Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cards and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation. It also accepts a list of `n` integers representing the numbers written on the cards. For each test case, the function returns the result of some operation involving the exchange of `k` cards, but the specific operation is not detailed here.**
