The code snippet increments the count of the character `char` in the list `count`. Given that `char` is the next character in the string `a`, the specific element in the list `count` corresponding to `char` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` has been incremented by 1, `char` is the next character in the string `a`**.
