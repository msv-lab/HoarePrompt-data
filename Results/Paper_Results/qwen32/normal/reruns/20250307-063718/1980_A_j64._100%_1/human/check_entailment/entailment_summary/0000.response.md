### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') is represented at least `m` times across `m` rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `a` of length `n`, which contains the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The `func_1` function initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero. Each index in this list corresponds to a difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the appropriate index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems:**
   - The function then iterates over the `count` list to check if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than `m`.
   - If a difficulty level has fewer problems than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds it to the `needed_problems` variable.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=2`, `D=2`, `F=0`, `A=0`
  - Needed problems: `F=1`, `A=1` → Total: `2`
  
- **Second Test Case:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=2`, `D=2`, `F=0`, `A=0`
  - Needed problems: `B=0`, `G=0`, `E=0`, `C=0`, `D=0`, `F=2`, `A=2` → Total: `4`
  - However, since we need each of the 7 levels to appear at least `m` times, and currently only `B`, `G`, `E`, `C`, `D` appear at least `m` times, we need to add `2` more problems for `F` and `2` more for `A`, making it `4` for `F` and `A` each, but since `m=2` and they are `0`, we need `2` for each which sums up to `4` but since we need to make sure all 7 have at least `m` problems, we need `2` for `F` and `2` for `A` and `1` for each of `B`, `G`, `E`, `C`, `D` which sums up to `5`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`, `A=0`
  - Needed problems: `A=1` → Total: `1`

The calculations match the expected output. Therefore, the program is correctly solving the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
