You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5. a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the sum of the differences between `m` and the count of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, where each difference is only considered if the count of the character is less than `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create in order to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

### Program Analysis
The program is structured as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. It calls a function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`.
4. The function `func_1` calculates the number of problems needed by:
   - Initializing a list `count` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G').
   - Counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` and storing these counts in the `count` list.
   - Calculating the number of additional problems needed by iterating over the `count` list and summing up the differences between `m` and the counts for each difficulty level where the count is less than `m`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify if the logic in the program correctly solves the problem:
1. **Counting the Problems**: The program correctly counts the number of problems for each difficulty level using the `count` list.
2. **Calculating Additional Problems**: The program correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level where the count is less than `m`. It sums up these differences to get the total number of additional problems required.

### Testing the Program
Let's verify the program with the provided example input:
- **Test Case 1**: `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
  - Count of each difficulty: `B=3`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`, `F=0`
  - Additional problems needed: `A=1`, `F=1` => Total = 2
- **Test Case 2**: `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
  - Count of each difficulty: `B=3`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`, `F=0`
  - Additional problems needed: `A=2`, `C=1`, `F=2`, `G=0` => Total = 5
- **Test Case 3**: `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Count of each difficulty: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`
  - Additional problems needed: `A=1` => Total = 1

The program produces the correct output for all the test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
