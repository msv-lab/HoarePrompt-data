### Reasoning:
The given program is structured to solve the problem by following these steps for each test case:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - Read the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting the Problems**:
   - Initialize a list `count` of size 7 (representing the difficulties 'A' to 'G') with all elements set to 0.
   - Iterate through the string `a` and increment the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating the Needed Problems**:
   - Initialize a variable `needed_problems` to 0.
   - Iterate through the `count` list. For each difficulty level, if the count of problems is less than `m`, add the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the value of `needed_problems` for each test case.

The logic implemented in the program ensures that for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it calculates the number of additional problems required to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each difficulty level. This is done correctly by checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adding the necessary number of problems to the `needed_problems` variable.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. It accurately counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the required additional problems based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
