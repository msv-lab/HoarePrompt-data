Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The current implementation calculates the total number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level independently, which is incorrect.

For example, if `m=2`, we need two problems of each difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G') for a total of 14 problems. If we only have one 'A' and one 'B', we need to create one more 'A' and one more 'B', and we still need to create all the other difficulties as well.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        needed_problems += max(0, m - count[i])
    return needed_problems * m

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level and then multiply by `m` to account for the fact that we need `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level.
