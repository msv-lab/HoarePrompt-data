Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, `n` and `m` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 50` and `1 <= m <= 5`, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` has been incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in the string `a`, `i` is `k + 2` where `0 <= k < 6`. If `count[i] < m`, `needed_problems` is increased by `m - count[i]`.**
