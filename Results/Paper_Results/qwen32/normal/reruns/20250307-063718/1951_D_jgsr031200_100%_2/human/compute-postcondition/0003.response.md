In the given initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and `n` is currently equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` at all. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
