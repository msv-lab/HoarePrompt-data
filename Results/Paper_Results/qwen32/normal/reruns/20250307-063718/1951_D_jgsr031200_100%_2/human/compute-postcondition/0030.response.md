Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to 1.
- `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`, but since `h` is not defined initially, we can infer it is being set in this manner.
- `curr` is `n`, which means `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Evaluating `costs`:
- The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1`. Given `n` is 0, this evaluates to `0 - k + 1` which is `-k + 1`.
- The second element of `costs` is 1.

### Conclusion:
The `costs` list is therefore `[-k + 1, 1]`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement `print(*costs)` will unpack the `costs` list and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **-k + 1 1**
