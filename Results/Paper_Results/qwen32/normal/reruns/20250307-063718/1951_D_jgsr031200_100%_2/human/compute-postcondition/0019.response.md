The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. Given the initial state, `n` is initially reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `curr` is equal to `n`, and `i` is 1.

Given `curr` is `n` and `i` is 1, `i * curr` is simply `n`. Therefore, subtracting `i * curr` from `n` results in `n` becoming 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`, `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is 1**.
