Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to 1.
  - Given `n` is 0, the first element of `costs` is `0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`.
  - The second element of `costs` is 1.
  - Therefore, `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`.
  - The value of `h` before this operation is not provided, but it is mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k` after this operation.
  - Given `n` is 0 and `i` is 1, `n // i` is 0.
  - Therefore, `h` becomes `h + 0 + 0 = h`.
  - Since `h` is already greater than or equal to `k`, this operation does not change the fact that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `curr` is `n`, which means `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement is straightforward. It prints the integer `2` regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
