The variable `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` from its current value. Given the initial state where `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `curr` is 0, the expression `i * curr` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `n` remains 0 after the operation.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`, `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
