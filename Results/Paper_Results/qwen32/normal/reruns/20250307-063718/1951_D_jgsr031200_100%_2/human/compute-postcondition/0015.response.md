The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. Given the initial state, `curr` is `n // i`, so the expression `i * curr` simplifies to `i * (n // i)`, which is the largest multiple of `i` that is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` is reduced by this largest multiple of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `curr` is `n // i`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is decreased by the largest multiple of `i` that is less than or equal to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
