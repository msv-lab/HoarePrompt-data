Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
3. `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to 1.
   - Given `n` is 0, the first element of `costs` becomes `0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`.
   - The second element of `costs` is 1.
4. `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`.
   - Since `n` is 0 and `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `h = h + (0 // 1) + 0`, which means `h` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `h` is not explicitly given, but we know it is greater than or equal to `k`.
5. `curr` is `n`, so `curr` is 0.
6. `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'`.
- None of the variables defined in the initial state (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
