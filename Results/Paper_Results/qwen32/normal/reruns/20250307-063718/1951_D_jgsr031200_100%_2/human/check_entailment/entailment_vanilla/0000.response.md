### Reasoning:

The problem requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The provided program seems to attempt to solve this problem but contains logical flaws and does not meet the requirements.

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.

2. **Costs Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is not a valid approach to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   
3. **Loop Through Costs**:
   - The loop iterates through the `costs` list, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. It calculates `curr` as `n // i`, which is the number of jewels Alice can buy at the current stall. It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and the conditions to check if `h < k` or `h >= k` are not correctly handled.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" with 2 stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and `1` if `h >= k`, which is not a guaranteed solution.
   - If `h < k`, it outputs "NO", which is correct in some cases but not in all.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given pricing strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
