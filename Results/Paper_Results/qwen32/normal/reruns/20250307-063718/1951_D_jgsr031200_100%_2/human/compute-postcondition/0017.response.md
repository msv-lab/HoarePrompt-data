The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to be the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, the value of `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is simply `n`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. The list `costs` has the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`. The variable `h` is `h + (n // i)`, and `curr` is initially `n // i`.

Since `i` is 1, `curr` remains `n` after the operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `curr` is `n`; `i` is 1**.
