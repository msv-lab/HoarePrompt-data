Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Let's analyze the program and identify a potential case where it fails.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls and Prices:**
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and prices is incomplete and incorrect. The program only considers two prices (`costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`) and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k` are such that setting up 60 stalls with appropriate prices is required.
   - The program does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice equals `k`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
255 8
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
However, the provided program will not generate this output. Instead, it will likely output something like:
```
NO
```
This is because the program does not correctly compute the prices for the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, Bob should set up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach where the prices are set such that Alice buys one jewel at each stall until she has bought `k` jewels. This can be done by setting prices in a decreasing order such that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        prices = []
        remaining_jewels = k
        remaining_coins = n
        for i in range(1, 61):
            if remaining_jewels == 0:
                break
            price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
            if price == 0:
                break
            num_jewels = remaining_coins // price
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
            remaining_coins -= num_jewels * price
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(prices))
            print(*prices)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected program ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting appropriate prices for the stalls.
