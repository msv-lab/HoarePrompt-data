### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel, such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes a function `func_1(n, k)` that attempts to solve this problem. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.

2. **Costs Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is not a valid approach to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic here is flawed because it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with these prices.

3. **Loop Through Costs**:
   - The loop iterates through the `costs` list, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. It calculates `curr` as `n // i`, which is the number of jewels Alice can buy at the current stall. It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The conditions to check if `h < k` or `h >= k` are not correctly handled. The program simply checks if `h < k` and outputs "NO" if true, which is not always correct. For example, if `h >= k`, it outputs "YES" with only two stalls, which may not be a valid solution.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" with 2 stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and `1` if `h >= k`, which is not a guaranteed solution. If `h < k`, it outputs "NO", which is correct in some cases but not in all.

#### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given pricing strategy. The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Final: **False**
