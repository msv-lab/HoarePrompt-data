The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to the result of the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state where `n` is 0 and `i` is 1, the result of `n // i` is `0`. Therefore, `curr` is updated to `0`.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`, `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**.
