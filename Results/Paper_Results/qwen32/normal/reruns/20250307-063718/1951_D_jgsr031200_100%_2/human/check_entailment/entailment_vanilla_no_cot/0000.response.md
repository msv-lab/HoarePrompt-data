Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to use a very simplistic approach to determine the prices for the stalls, but it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not consider all possible combinations of stall prices.

2. **Handling of Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not ensure that the sum of the jewels bought from each stall equals `k`.

3. **Number of Stalls**: The program only considers a maximum of 2 stalls, which is far too limited to solve the problem for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

4. **Output Format**: Even when it does output "YES", it does not provide a correct list of stall prices that would ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

To solve the problem correctly, Bob needs to set up a series of stalls with prices such that the cumulative number of jewels Alice can buy equals `k`. One possible approach is to use binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls, ensuring that the sum of the jewels bought matches `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 0:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif n < k:
        print("NO")
    else:
        prices = []
        remaining = k
        current_price = 1
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining % 2 == 1:
                prices.append(current_price)
            remaining //= 2
            current_price *= 2
        
        if len(prices) > 60:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(len(prices))
            print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
```

This program uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls, ensuring that the sum of the jewels bought equals `k` and that the number of stalls is at most 60.
