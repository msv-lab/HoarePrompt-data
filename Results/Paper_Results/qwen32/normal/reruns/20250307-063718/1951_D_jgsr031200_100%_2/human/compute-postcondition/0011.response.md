The code snippet provided initializes a variable `h` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `costs`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is 0.**
