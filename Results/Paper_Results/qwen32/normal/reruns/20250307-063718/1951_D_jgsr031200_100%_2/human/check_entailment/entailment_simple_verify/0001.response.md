### Reasoning:

The problem requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The provided program attempts to solve this problem but contains logical flaws and does not meet the requirements.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotations:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - **If `n == k`**: The program correctly outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is correct.
   - **If `n < k`**: The program correctly outputs "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`. This is also correct.

2. **Costs Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is not a valid approach to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic here is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with these prices.

3. **Loop Through Costs**:
   - The loop iterates through the `costs` list, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. It calculates `curr` as `n // i`, which is the number of jewels Alice can buy at the current stall. It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The conditions to check if `h < k` or `h >= k` are not correctly handled.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" with 2 stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and `1` if `h >= k`, which is not a guaranteed solution. 
   - If `h < k`, it outputs "NO", which is correct in some cases but not in all.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- **State Inside `func_1`**:
  - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", "1", and "1", which is correct.
  - If `n < k`, it prints "NO", which is correct.
  - If `n > k`, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then enters a loop to calculate `h` and adjust `n`.
  - The loop logic is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The final check `if (h < k)` is not sufficient to guarantee the correct solution.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given pricing strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
