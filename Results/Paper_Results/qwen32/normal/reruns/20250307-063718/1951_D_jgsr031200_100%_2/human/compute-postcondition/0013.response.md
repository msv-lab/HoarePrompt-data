The given code snippet is `curr = n // i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `i` is a positive integer (as it is commonly used in such contexts), we'll proceed with the calculation using `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`
- `h` is 0

The code `curr = n // i` performs integer division of `n` by `i` and assigns the result to `curr`.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `curr`. However, we can express `curr` in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is 0; `curr` is `n // i`.**
