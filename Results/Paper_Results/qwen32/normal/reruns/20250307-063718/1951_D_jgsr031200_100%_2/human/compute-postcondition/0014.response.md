The code snippet `h += curr` increments the variable `h` by the value of `curr`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Since `curr` is `n // i`, the new value of `h` is `h + (n // i)`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `curr` is `n // i`.**
