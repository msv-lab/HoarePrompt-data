The code snippet provided is `h += curr`. Given the initial state, the value of `curr` is 0. Therefore, adding `curr` to `h` does not change the value of `h`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`, `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains 0, `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` remains a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`, `h` remains `h + (n // i) + n` (which simplifies to `h` since `n` is 0 and `i` is 1), `curr` remains 0, and `i` remains 1.
