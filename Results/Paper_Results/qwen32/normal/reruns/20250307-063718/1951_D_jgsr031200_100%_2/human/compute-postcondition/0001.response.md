The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes `n` and `k` as positive integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), and it specifies that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `n` or `k`.

Output: **YES**
