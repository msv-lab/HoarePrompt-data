The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the `costs` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on how `i` is updated and the implications on the loop's continuation.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element that was processed. Since `costs` is a list with only two elements, the loop will execute once for each element in `costs`. If the loop has already executed for the first element, the next iteration will process the second element.

Let's break down the state adjustments:
- `i` is the current element being processed in the `costs` list.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `costs`, which is `1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration.

State: **`n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `curr` is `n // i`; `i` is 1**
