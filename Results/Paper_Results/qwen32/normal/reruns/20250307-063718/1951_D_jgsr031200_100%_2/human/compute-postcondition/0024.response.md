The given loop iterates over the elements of the `costs` list, which initially contains `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The loop reduces `n` by `i * (n // i)` in each iteration, where `i` is the current element from the `costs` list, and it increments `h` by the quotient `n // i`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration, `n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, and `h` is incremented by `n // i`.
- After the second iteration, `n` becomes 0, and `h` is incremented by `n` (which is now 0).
- After the third iteration, `n` remains 0, and `curr` becomes 0.

Since the second iteration already reduces `n` to 0, the loop will not execute further iterations because there are no more elements in the `costs` list to process. Therefore, the final state of the variables will be the state after the second iteration.

Output State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, costs is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to 1, h is `h + (n // i) + n`, curr is `n`, i is 1**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `n` becomes 0, and `h` is the sum of the quotients `n // i` for each iteration. The variable `k` remains unchanged, and `costs` retains its initial values.
