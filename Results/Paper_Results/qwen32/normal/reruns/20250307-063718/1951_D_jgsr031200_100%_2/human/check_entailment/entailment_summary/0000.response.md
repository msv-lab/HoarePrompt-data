### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by checking if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting prices for up to 60 stalls. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect and does not follow a logical approach to solve the problem as described.

Here's a breakdown of the issues with the current implementation:

1. **Initial Conditions Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO" since it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The core logic in the loop where `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` is incorrect. The program tries to distribute the coins among the stalls but does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The loop sums up the number of jewels Alice can buy at different stalls (`h += curr`) and subtracts the coins spent (`n -= i * curr`), but it does not adjust the prices or the number of stalls correctly to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The check `if h < k` is not sufficient to determine if the solution is correct, as it does not account for the possibility of adjusting prices and the number of stalls to meet the exact requirement of `k` jewels.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" and prints two prices if the condition `h >= k` is met, but the prices and the number of stalls are not guaranteed to be correct or optimal.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here's a possible approach:

- If `k <= 60`, we can set up `k` stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall.
- If `k > 60`, we need to be more strategic. One way to do this is to use the binary representation of `k` to determine the stalls and prices. For example, if `k = 8`, we can set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy 1, 2, 4, and 1 jewel from the respective stalls, summing up to 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
