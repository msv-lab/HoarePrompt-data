The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
   - The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(1)`.
   - This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `n` or `k`, the values of these variables do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
