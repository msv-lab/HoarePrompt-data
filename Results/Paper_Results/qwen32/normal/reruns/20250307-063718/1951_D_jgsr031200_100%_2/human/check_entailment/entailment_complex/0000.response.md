Reasoning:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem statement. The main issue lies in the way it attempts to solve the problem and the logic used within the `func_1` function.

Let's break down the problems in the provided code:

1. **Handling the case when `n == k`**: This is correctly handled by the code. If `n` (the number of coins) is equal to `k` (the number of jewels Alice wants to buy), Bob can simply set up one stall with a price of `1` coin per jewel, and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Handling the case when `n < k`**: This is also correctly handled by the code. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it is impossible for her to buy exactly `k` jewels, so the code correctly prints "NO".

3. **Handling the case when `n > k`**: This is where the code fails. The logic used in the code to handle this case is flawed. The code attempts to set up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy is at least `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The code does not consider how to distribute the prices among the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the 60-stall limit.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves using a greedy strategy with binary search or other methods to find a sequence of prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible solution is to use prices that are powers of 2, as this allows for a flexible distribution of the number of jewels Alice can buy. For example, if `k` is 8, Bob can set up stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` and Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels. This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and does not exceed the 60-stall limit.

Given the issues in the provided code, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
