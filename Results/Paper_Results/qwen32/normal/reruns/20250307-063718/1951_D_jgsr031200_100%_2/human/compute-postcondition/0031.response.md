Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to 1, `curr` is `n`, and `i` is 1. If `h` is less than `k`, the state remains as described. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `h + (n // i) + n` and `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
