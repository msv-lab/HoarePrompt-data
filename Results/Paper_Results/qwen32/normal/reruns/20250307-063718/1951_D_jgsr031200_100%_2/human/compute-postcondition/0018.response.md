The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given the initial state, `curr` is equal to `n`, so `h` becomes `h + n`.

Output State: **`n` is reduced by `i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list with the first element equal to `n - k + 1` and the second element equal to `1`; `h` is `h + (n // i) + n`; `curr` is `n`; `i` is 1**.
