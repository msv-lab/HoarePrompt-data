You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It then prints the time in 12-hour format with AM/PM for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Let's break down the logic and see if it adheres to the requirements:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the time string `s` in the format `hh:mm`.
3. It then extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
4. The logic for determining the 12-hour format hour (`hh`) is as follows:
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it outputs `'12'`.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it outputs `h` as is.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and outputs the result prefixed with `'0'` if the result is a single digit.
5. The program then outputs the minutes part `s[2:]` and determines whether it is AM or PM by checking if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`.

However, there are a few issues in the program:
- When `h` is greater than `'12'`, the subtraction `int(h) - 12` is correct, but the output formatting is incorrect. The code uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` which will always output a leading zero even if the result is a two-digit number (e.g., `13` becomes `'01'` instead of `'01'`).
- The logic for handling the hour `'12'` is correct, but the logic for handling hours greater than `'12'` should ensure that the output is always two digits.

Here's the corrected part of the logic:
- If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it should be `'{:02}'.format(int(h) - 12)` to ensure two-digit output.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
