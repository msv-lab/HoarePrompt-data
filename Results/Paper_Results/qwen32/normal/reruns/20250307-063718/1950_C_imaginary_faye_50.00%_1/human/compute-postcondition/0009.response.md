Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- `h` is an integer greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extracting `h`**: The variable `h` is derived from the first two characters of the string `s`. According to the precondition, `h` is an integer greater than 12 and not equal to '00'. This means `h` can be any value from '13' to '24' (assuming the format of `s` is in the form of "HHMM" where HH is the hour and MM is the minute).

2. **Converting `h` to an integer**: The `int(h)` function converts the string `h` to an integer.

3. **Subtracting 12**: The expression `int(h) - 12` subtracts 12 from the integer value of `h`. Since `h` is greater than 12, this subtraction will result in a positive integer between 1 and 12.

4. **Formatting and Printing**: The `print` function formats the result of the subtraction with a leading '0' using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`. This ensures that the output is always a two-character string, with a leading zero if the result is a single-digit number (i.e., between 1 and 9).

### Example Scenarios:
- If `h` is '13', then `int(h) - 12` is `1`, and the output will be `'01'`.
- If `h` is '19', then `int(h) - 12` is `7`, and the output will be `'07'`.
- If `h` is '24', then `int(h) - 12` is `12`, and the output will be `'12'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output a two-character string representing the hour in 12-hour format with a leading zero if necessary. The exact value depends on the input string `s` and the value of `h`.

Output: **0[converted_h] (where [converted_h] is the result of int(h) - 12, formatted as a two-character string with a leading zero if necessary)**
