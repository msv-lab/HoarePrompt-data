To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variable `s`**: This is a string input by the user.
2. **Variable `h`**: This is the first two characters of the string `s`. 
   - If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`.
   - Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12.
   - Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.
3. **Output Statement**: The print statement is `print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])`.

Let's analyze the print statement:
- `s[2:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end of the string.
- `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to 'AM' if `int(h) < 12` and 'PM' if `int(h) >= 12`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Extract `h`**: The first two characters of the string `s` are extracted and stored in `h`.
2. **Conditional Check**:
   - If `h` is '00', then `h` remains '00'.
   - If `h` is not '00', convert `h` to an integer and check if it is less than or equal to 12.
3. **Determine 'AM' or 'PM'**:
   - If `int(h) < 12`, the expression evaluates to 'AM'.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, the expression evaluates to 'PM'.
4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code prints the substring of `s` starting from the third character (`s[2:]`) followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s` is '10:30', then `h` is '10'. Since `int(h) < 12`, the output will be '30AM'.
- If `s` is '14:45', then `h` is '14'. Since `int(h) >= 12`, the output will be '45PM'.
- If `s` is '00:00', then `h` is '00'. Since `h` is '00', the output will be '00AM' (though the logic for '00' is not explicitly changed to 'PM', it will still print 'AM').

Given these steps, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **s[2:] ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character, and ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] is 'AM' if the integer value of the first two characters of s is less than 12, otherwise 'PM')**
