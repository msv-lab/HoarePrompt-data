Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `h` is derived from the first two characters of the new string `s`.
- If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`.
- If `h` is not '00':
  - If the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is considered to be less than or equal to 12.
  - If the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is considered to be greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet explicitly specifies the string `'12'` to be printed. The `end=''` argument indicates that no newline character should be added at the end of the printed string.

The values of `t`, `s`, and `h` are given in the initial state, but they do not affect the execution of the `print('12', end='')` statement because the statement does not reference these variables. The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `h`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'12'` without a newline character at the end.

Output: **12**
