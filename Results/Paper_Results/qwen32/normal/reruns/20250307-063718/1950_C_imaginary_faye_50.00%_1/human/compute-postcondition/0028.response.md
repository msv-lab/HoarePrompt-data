Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1439\), `s` is the new string input by the user, and `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`. Otherwise, `h` is not '00', and the integer value of `h` is either less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block, `t` remains within its initial range, `s` retains its new string value, and `h` is evaluated such that if it is '00', it remains unchanged. If `h` is not '00', it is categorized based on whether its integer value is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.
