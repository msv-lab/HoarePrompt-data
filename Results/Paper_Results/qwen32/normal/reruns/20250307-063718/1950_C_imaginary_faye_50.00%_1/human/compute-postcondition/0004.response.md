The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('12', end='')
```

The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the screen. Here, the message is the string `'12'`. The `end=''` parameter specifies that after printing the message, no newline character (`\n`) should be added at the end. This means the cursor will remain on the same line after the print statement is executed.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `s`, and `h` are described, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only outputs the string `'12'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **12**
