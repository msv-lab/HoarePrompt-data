Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined after being called, which will result in a `NameError` because the function is not recognized at the point of its first usage.
2. The handling of the hour conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format is incorrect. Specifically, the condition for converting hours greater than 12 is not correctly implemented. For example, `h == '00'` should be converted to `12 AM`, `h == '12'` should be converted to `12 PM`, and hours greater than 12 should be adjusted by subtracting 12 and converting to PM.
3. The formatting of the hour when it is less than 10 (e.g., converting `09` to `9` instead of keeping it as `09`) is not handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[3:]
        if h == 0:
            print('12', m, 'AM')
        elif h < 12:
            print(s[:2], m, 'AM')
        elif h == 12:
            print('12', m, 'PM')
        else:
            print(f'{h - 12:02}', m, 'PM')

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the hour is properly converted to the 12-hour format and maintains the leading zero for single-digit hours.
