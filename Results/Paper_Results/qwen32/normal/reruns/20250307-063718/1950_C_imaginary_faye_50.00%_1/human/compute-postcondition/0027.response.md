To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1439\).
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the new string `s`.
   - If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is not '00', and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12. Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The print statement will execute the following:
     - Convert `h` to an integer using `int(h)`.
     - Subtract 12 from this integer value.
     - Format the result as a string prefixed with '0'.
     - Print the resulting string without adding a newline at the end (`end=''`).

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - Since `h` is the first two characters of the string `s` and assuming `h` is not '00', `h` could be any two-digit string from '01' to '99'.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to '12', the subtraction `int(h) - 12` will result in a non-positive number. However, since `h` is a two-digit string and we are only considering `h` greater than '12', the result will be a positive number.
   - The result of `int(h) - 12` will be a single digit number (since `h` is at most '99' and `99 - 12 = 87`), but the format string `'0{}'` ensures that the result is prefixed with '0'.

5. **Output**:
   - The output will be the string '0' concatenated with the result of `int(h) - 12`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **0[result of int(h) - 12] (where h is the first two characters of the string s and int(h) > 12)**
