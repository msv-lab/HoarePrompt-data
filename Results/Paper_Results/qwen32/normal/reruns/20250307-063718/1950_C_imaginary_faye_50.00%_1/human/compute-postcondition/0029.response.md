Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1439\), `s` is the new string input by the user, and `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`. Otherwise, `h` is not '00', and the integer value of `h` is either less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.**
