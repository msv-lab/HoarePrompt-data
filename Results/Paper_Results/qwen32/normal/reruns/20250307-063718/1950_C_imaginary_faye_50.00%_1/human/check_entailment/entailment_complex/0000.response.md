Reasoning:  
The provided Python program `func_1` aims to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it processes a string in the format "hh:mm". Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` to handle midnight correctly.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints `h` directly.
   - Otherwise, it prints `h - 12` after converting `h` to an integer. However, there's a problem here: if `h` is a two-digit number greater than 12, `h - 12` might not be a two-digit number, leading to incorrect formatting. The program uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` which is incorrect for values of `h` greater than 21 because it will prepend a '0' to numbers like 13-19, resulting in incorrect formatting (e.g., '01' instead of '1').
3. **Minute Printing**: The program prints the minutes part directly using `s[2:]`.
4. **AM/PM Determination**: It uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and selects the appropriate element based on whether the hour `h` is 12 or greater.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles midnight (`'00:00'` to `'11:59'`) and noon (`'12:00'` to `'12:59'`), but it incorrectly handles hours from `'13:00'` to `'23:59'` due to the formatting issue mentioned.

**Example of Incorrect Output**:
- For the input `'13:00'`, the program should output `'01:00 PM'`, but it outputs `'0100 PM'`.
- For the input `'21:37'`, the program should output `'09:37 PM'`, but it outputs `'0937 PM'`.

Thus, the program is not correct due to the improper handling of hours greater than 12.

Correctness: **False**
