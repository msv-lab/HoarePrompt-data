Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1440\), `s` is the new string input by the user, `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`. Otherwise, `h` is not '00', and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12. Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.**
