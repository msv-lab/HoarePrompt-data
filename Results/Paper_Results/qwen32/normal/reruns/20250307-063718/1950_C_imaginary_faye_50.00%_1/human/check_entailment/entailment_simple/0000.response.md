Reasoning: 

The provided program `func_1()` is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.
3. It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
4. It then checks the value of `h`:
   - If `h` is "00", it prints "12" (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If `h` is between "01" and "12" (inclusive), it prints `h` as is.
   - If `h` is greater than "12", it converts the hour to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h`. It also ensures that the leading zero is added if the resulting hour is less than 10 by using string formatting.
5. It prints the minutes part of the time `s[2:]` (which includes the colon and the minutes).
6. It determines whether the time is AM or PM by checking if `h` is greater than or equal to 12. If true, it prints "PM", otherwise "AM".
7. The process repeats for all test cases.

The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format and includes the correct AM/PM designation. It also preserves the leading zeros in the hour and minute parts of the time.

Correctness: **True**
