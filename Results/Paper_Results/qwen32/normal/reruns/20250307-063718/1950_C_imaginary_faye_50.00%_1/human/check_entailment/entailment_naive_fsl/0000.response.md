Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain edge cases:

1. **Handling of hours 13-19**: The code incorrectly formats hours from 13 to 19. For example, if the input is "13:00", the output will be "01:00 PM" instead of "01:00 PM". The issue is with the line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`, which incorrectly adds a leading zero for all values from 13 to 19.

2. **Handling of hour 12**: The code incorrectly outputs "00:00 PM" for "12:00". It should output "12:00 PM".

3. **Handling of hour 00**: The code correctly outputs "12:00 AM" for "00:00".

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the problem:

- Input: "13:00"
- Expected Output: "01:00 PM"
- Actual Output: "01:00 PM" (incorrectly formatted as "01:00 PM" due to the leading zero issue)

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h, m = s.split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = "AM"
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = "AM"
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = "PM"
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = "PM"
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

This corrected code properly handles all edge cases, including the correct formatting of hours from 13 to 19 and the correct handling of 12 AM and 12 PM.
