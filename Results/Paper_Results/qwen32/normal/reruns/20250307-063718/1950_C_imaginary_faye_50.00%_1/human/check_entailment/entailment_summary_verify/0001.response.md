Reasoning: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine if the program correctly converts a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Hour Extraction**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it correctly prints `'12'` to represent midnight in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints `h` as is. However, this logic is flawed because it does not handle the case where `h` is `'12'` correctly (it should be `'12 PM'`).
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary. However, the formatting is incorrect for two-digit numbers (e.g., `13` becomes `'01'` instead of `'01'`).

4. **Minute Extraction and AM/PM Determination**:
   - The minutes part `s[2:]` is correctly printed.
   - The AM/PM determination is done by checking if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`. This logic is correct but does not handle the edge case where `h` is `'12'` (it should be `'12 PM'`).

5. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The logic for handling the hour `'12'` should be corrected to ensure that `'12 AM'` and `'12 PM'` are printed correctly.
   - The formatting for hours greater than `'12'` should ensure that the output is always two digits using `'{:02}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

Given the identified issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the edge cases correctly and has formatting issues for hours greater than `'12'`.

Final: **False**
