Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1440. For each test case, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where "hh" is a two-digit integer from "00" to "23" representing hours, and "mm" is a two-digit integer from "00" to "59" representing minutes. The function processes each test case and returns the corresponding output based on the given time.**
