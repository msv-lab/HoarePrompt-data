Let's break down the print statement and the variables involved based on the given initial state:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer between 1 and 1439, inclusive. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output directly.

2. **Variable `s`**: This is a string input by the user. The exact value of `s` is not provided, but we know that `h` is derived from it.

3. **Variable `h`**: This is the first two characters of the string `s`. The value of `h` determines which part of the print statement is executed:
   - If `h` is '00', no further changes are made to `h`.
   - If `h` is not '00', the integer value of `h` is either less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.

4. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - `s[2:]`: This part of the statement prints the substring of `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This part of the statement is a list `['AM', 'PM']` indexed by the boolean expression `int(h) >= 12`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, it evaluates to `1`, and the element at index `1` of the list is `'PM'`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, it evaluates to `0`, and the element at index `0` of the list is `'AM'`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
- First, the code takes the substring of `s` from the third character to the end (`s[2:]`).
- Then, it checks the value of `h` (the first two characters of `s`):
  - If `h` is '00', it remains '00'.
  - If `h` is not '00', it converts `h` to an integer and checks if it is greater than or equal to 12.
  - Based on this check, it selects either 'AM' or 'PM' from the list `['AM', 'PM']`.

### Output:
The output will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of the first two characters of `s`.

Output: **s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] (where s[2:] is the substring of s from the third character to the end, and ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] is 'AM' if the integer value of the first two characters of s is less than 12, otherwise 'PM')**
