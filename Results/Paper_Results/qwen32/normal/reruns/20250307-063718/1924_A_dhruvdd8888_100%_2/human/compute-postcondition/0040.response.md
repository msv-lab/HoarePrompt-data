Postcondition: **`win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element. If `i` is not in `win`, the program returns the string formed by joining the characters in the list `ans`, appending the first character `i` from the iterable `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state and no return value is specified.**
