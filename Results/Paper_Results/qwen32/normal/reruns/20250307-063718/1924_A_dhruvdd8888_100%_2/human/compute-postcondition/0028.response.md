Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, `win` contains the character `i`. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` becomes an empty set, `ans` contains the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes occur to any variables.**
