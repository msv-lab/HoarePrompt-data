Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of `k` unique characters. This does not equate to checking if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - The function incorrectly assumes that if `s` contains `n` sequences of `k` unique characters, then all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. This is not true because the order and combination of characters matter in subsequences.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function uses a set `win` to track unique characters encountered in `s` and clears `win` once it reaches `k` unique characters. This approach does not guarantee that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
   - The function constructs a string for the "NO" case by appending characters from `ans` and adding extra 'a' characters. This method does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid counterexample that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Output Issues**:
   - The function prints "YES" if `ps` (number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters) is greater than or equal to `n`. This is incorrect because, as mentioned, having `n` sequences of `k` unique characters does not ensure all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The function attempts to print a counterexample string when `ps` is less than `n`, but the construction method is flawed and may not produce a valid string.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
