You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to output one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Generating Possible Characters:**
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and keeps track of characters in `win` that have been encountered.
   - When all `k` characters are found in sequence (i.e., `len(win) == k`), it adds the last character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - This process continues until the program either finds `n` such sequences or finishes iterating over `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ps` (the count of sequences found) is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Subsequences:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that finding `k` unique characters in sequence means finding all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - It does not actually check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence:**
   - The logic for constructing a missing subsequence is flawed. The program simply appends characters from `win` and adds 'a' to fill the remaining length, which does not guarantee it will be a missing subsequence.

3. **Inefficient Approach:**
   - The problem requires checking all possible strings of length `n` (which is `k^n` possibilities), which cannot be efficiently done by the current approach.

### Conclusion

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly constructs a missing subsequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
