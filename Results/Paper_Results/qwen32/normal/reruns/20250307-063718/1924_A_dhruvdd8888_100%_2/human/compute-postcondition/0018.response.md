The code snippet provided is `ps += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `ps` by 1. The initial state does not include a variable named `ps`, so we can infer that `ps` was previously defined and holds some integer value. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `ps`, we will denote its new value as `previous_value_of_ps + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character, `win` is a set that includes the character `i`, `ans` is a list that includes the character `i`, `ps` is `previous_value_of_ps + 1`.**
