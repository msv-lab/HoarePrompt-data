Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the string input by the user consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to the string input by the user, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
