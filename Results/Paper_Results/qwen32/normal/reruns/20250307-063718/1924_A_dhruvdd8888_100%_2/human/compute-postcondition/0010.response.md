The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain `i` as its first element. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing `i` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `i`, `ps` is 0, `i` is in `us`.**
