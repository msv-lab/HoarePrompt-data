Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character. If `i` is in `us`, and `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list that includes the character `i`, and `ps` is `previous_value_of_ps + 1`. Otherwise, `win` retains its original value and no other variables are modified. If `i` is not in `us`, no variables are modified.***
