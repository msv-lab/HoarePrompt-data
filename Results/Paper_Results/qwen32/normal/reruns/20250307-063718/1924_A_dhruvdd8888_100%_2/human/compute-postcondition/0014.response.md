Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is in `us`. If `win` was equal to `us` (i.e., `win` had `k` elements), `ans` is a list containing `i` and `ps` is 1; otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list and `ps` remains 0.**
