The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The initial state of these variables is not specified, but after the execution of the code, their values will be set according to the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 10^5. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are now set to the integers read from the input, with `n` between 1 and 26, `k` between 1 and 26, and `m` between 1 and 1000. The string `s` is still a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and the constraints on the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases remain valid.
