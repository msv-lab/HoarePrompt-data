Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element, and `i` is in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element. If `i` is not in `win`, the program returns the string formed by joining the characters in the list `ans`, appending the first character `i` from the iterable `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state and no return value is specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, the program returns the string formed by joining the characters in `ans`, followed by the next element `i` in `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
