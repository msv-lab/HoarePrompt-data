The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the iterable `us`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the last element processed from `us`. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `us`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `us` still has at least one element left to be processed. Since `us` is described as an iterable that contains at least one element, we can assume that there is a next element to process.

State: **`win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `us`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we represent it as "the next element in `us`". This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the next element from `us`.
