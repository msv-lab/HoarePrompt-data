Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes predefined variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` as described in the constraints. The function returns 'YES' in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns a string constructed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the character `i`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. In Case_3, it returns a string formed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the first character `i` from `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. In Case_4, it returns a string formed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the next element `i` from `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.**
