The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable `us`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `us` must be an iterable (such as a list, tuple, set, etc.) that contains at least one element. The state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted in terms of the loop's execution.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element**
