The code snippet `win.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `win`. Since `i` is described as the next character in the string `s`, and `win` is initially not mentioned to have any specific elements, after the execution, `win` will contain the character `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `win` contains the character `i`.**
