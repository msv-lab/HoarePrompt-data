Postcondition: **`win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable that contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, the program returns the string formed by joining the characters in `ans`, followed by the next element `i` in `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.**
