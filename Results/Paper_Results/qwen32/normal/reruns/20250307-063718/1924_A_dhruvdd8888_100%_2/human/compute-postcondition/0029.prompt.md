Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the string input by the user consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is in `us`. If `win` was equal to `us` (i.e., `win` had `k` elements), `ans` is a list containing `i` and `ps` is 1; otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list and `ps` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character. If `i` is in `us`, and `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list that includes the character `i`, and `ps` is `previous_value_of_ps + 1`. Otherwise, `win` retains its original value and no other variables are modified. If `i` is not in `us`, no variables are modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, `win` contains the character `i`. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` becomes an empty set, `ans` contains the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes occur to any variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
