The code snippet creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. The set `us` will now include characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet.

For example, if `k` is 3, `us` will be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the string input by the user consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
