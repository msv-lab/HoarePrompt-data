You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing characters that caused `win` to be filled with `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was filled with `k` unique characters. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: the string formed by `''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` during the second iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes predefined variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` as described in the constraints. The function returns 'YES' in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns a string constructed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the character `i`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. In Case_3, it returns a string formed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the first character `i` from `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. In Case_4, it returns a string formed by joining characters in `ans`, appending the next element `i` from `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns the string formed by joining the characters in `ans`, followed by the character `i`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

Case_3: The program returns the string formed by joining the characters in the list `ans`, appending the first character `i` from the iterable `us`, and then adding 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

Case_4: The program returns the string formed by joining the characters in `ans`, followed by the next element `i` in `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
