The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the character that was just processed. To start the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current position of `i` in the string `s` as `pos`. After processing `i` at position `pos`, the next character to be processed will be at position `pos + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be the character at position `pos + 1` in the string `s`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character.** 

If we denote the current character as `i` at position `pos`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `s[pos + 1]`.

For the sake of the format, we'll assume `i` was the character at position `pos` and now it needs to be the character at position `pos + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character.**

Since we don't have the exact position, we can just say `i` is the next character in the sequence:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
