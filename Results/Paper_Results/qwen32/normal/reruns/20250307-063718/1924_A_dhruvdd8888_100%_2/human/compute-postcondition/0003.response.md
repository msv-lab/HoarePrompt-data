The code snippet provided initializes a new set named `win`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, or `us`. The only new variable introduced is `win`, which is an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the string input by the user consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set.**
