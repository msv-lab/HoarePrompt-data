Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string consisting of at least one character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing `i`, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, `i` is in `us`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` has been added to the set `win`, so now `win` contains the element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
