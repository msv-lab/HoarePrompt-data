Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations. The logic in the function `func_1` does not account for the most efficient way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order. The current implementation only adds the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before a '0', which is not a correct strategy to minimize the total cost.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to determine the number of '1's that need to be moved to the right of each '0' and calculate the cost accordingly. A more appropriate approach involves iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's that have been seen so far, and for each '0', adding the number of '1's seen so far to the cost, as each of those '1's needs to be shifted past the '0'. However, the given program does not do this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '1':
            one_count += 1
        elif char == '0' and one_count > 0:
            cost += one_count
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This corrected version should give the correct minimum cost for each test case.
