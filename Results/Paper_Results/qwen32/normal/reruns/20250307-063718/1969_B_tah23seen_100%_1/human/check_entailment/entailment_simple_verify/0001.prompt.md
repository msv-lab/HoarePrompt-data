You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `cost` is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's, and `one` is the count of trailing '1's in `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns `cost`, which is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's in the string `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s should come before all 1s) using the minimum total cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The goal is to determine the optimal sequence of such operations to achieve the sorted string with the least cost.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting Requirement**: The final sorted string will be of the form `000...000111...111`.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of moving a '0' past a '1' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (for the operation itself).
3. **Greedy Approach**: The provided code uses a greedy approach where it counts the number of '1's encountered and adds the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after any '1's.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost as follows:
- It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered (`one > 0`), it adds the cost `one + 1` to the total cost.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `one` is incremented to 1.
   - When encountering '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's encountered, so no cost.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Two '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 3 = 5` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Two more '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `4 + 1 = 5`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 4 + 5 = 11` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations.

Thus, the correctness of the program is **True**.
