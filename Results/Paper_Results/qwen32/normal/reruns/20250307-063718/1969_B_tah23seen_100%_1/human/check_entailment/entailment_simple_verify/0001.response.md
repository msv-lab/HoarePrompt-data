### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code using the annotated version and the examples to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The task is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Key Observations:
1. The final sorted string will be a sequence of all '0's followed by all '1's.
2. The cost to move a '0' past a '1' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (for the operation itself).

#### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost as follows:
- `cost` is initialized to 0.
- `one` is initialized to 0.
- The function iterates through each character in the string `s`:
  - If the character is '1', `one` is incremented.
  - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

#### Annotations and Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples using the annotations:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `one` is incremented to 1.
   - When encountering '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's encountered, so no cost.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Two '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 3 = 5` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Two more '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `4 + 1 = 5`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 4 + 5 = 11` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations. The annotations and the verification with examples confirm that the code behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
