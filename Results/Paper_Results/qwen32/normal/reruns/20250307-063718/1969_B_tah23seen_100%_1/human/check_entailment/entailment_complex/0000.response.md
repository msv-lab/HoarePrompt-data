### Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost based on a specific strategy: it counts the number of '1's encountered and, whenever a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', it adds the count of '1's plus one to the cost. This strategy leverages the fact that each '0' that follows a '1' can be moved to the left of all the '1's before it by performing cyclic shifts on the appropriate substrings.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Cost Calculation**:
   - When a '1' is encountered, the `one` counter is incremented.
   - When a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', it means this '0' needs to be moved past all the preceding '1's. The cost to move this '0' past all the preceding '1's is the number of preceding '1's plus one (the length of the substring from the first '1' to this '0').
   - The `cost` variable accumulates these costs.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the string `11000`:
     - The first two characters are '1's, so `one` becomes 2.
     - The next three characters are '0's. Each '0' needs to be moved past the two '1's before it.
     - For each '0', the cost is `one + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - Since there are three '0's, the total cost is `3 * 3 = 9`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings with no '0's or no '1's are already sorted, so the cost is 0.
   - Strings like `101011` require multiple shifts, and the function correctly calculates the cumulative cost.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the described operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
