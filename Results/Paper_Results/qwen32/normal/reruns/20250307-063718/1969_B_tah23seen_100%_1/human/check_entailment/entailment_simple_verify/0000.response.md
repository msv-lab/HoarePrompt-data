### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order for all possible cases. The function `func_1` assumes that the cost is only incurred when a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, and it adds the count of '1's plus one to the cost. However, this approach does not account for all possible optimal cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

Let's break down the annotations and the logic in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `one` is initialized to 0.

2. **Iteration through the string**:
   - For each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '1', increment `one` by 1.
     - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.

3. **State after the loop**:
   - `cost` is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's.
   - `one` is the count of trailing '1's in `s`.

The logic in `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. It only calculates the cost based on the pattern of '1's followed by '0's, which is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum cost.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:

- Input: `11010`
- Expected Output: `3`

The provided function `func_1` would calculate the cost as follows:
1. The first '1' is encountered, increment `one` to 1.
2. The second '1' is encountered, increment `one` to 2.
3. The first '0' is encountered, add `one + 1` (2 + 1 = 3) to `cost`.
4. The third '1' is encountered, increment `one` to 3.
5. The second '0' is encountered, add `one + 1` (3 + 1 = 4) to `cost`.

Thus, the total cost calculated by `func_1` is `3 + 4 = 7`, which is incorrect. The optimal cost is `3` as explained in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for all possible cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
