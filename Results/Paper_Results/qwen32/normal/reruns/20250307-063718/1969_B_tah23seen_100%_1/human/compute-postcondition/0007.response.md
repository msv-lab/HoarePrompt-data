The code snippet `cost += one + 1` increments the variable `cost` by the sum of `one` and `1`. Given that `one` is greater than 0, the new value of `cost` will be `cost + one + 1`. The values of `s`, `one`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 1, `cost` is `cost + one + 1`, `one` is greater than 0, and the current character `i` is '0'**.
