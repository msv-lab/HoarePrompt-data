Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order for all possible cases. The function `func_1` appears to assume that the only cost incurred is when a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, and it adds the count of '1's plus one to the cost. However, this approach does not account for all possible optimal cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `11010`
- Expected Output: `3`

Explanation of the expected output:
1. Choose the substring `[1, 2]`: `11010 -> 10110` (cost: 2)
2. Choose the substring `[2, 3]`: `10110 -> 01110` (cost: 2)
3. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `01110 -> 00111` (cost: 3)

Total cost: `2 + 2 + 3 = 7` (However, the optimal cost is `3` by performing the following operations:
1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `11010 -> 01110` (cost: 3)

The provided function would incorrectly calculate the cost as `5` for this input because it would see the first '0' after two '1's and add `2 + 1 = 3` to the cost, and then see another '0' after one '1' and add `1 + 1 = 2` to the cost, resulting in a total cost of `5`.

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all cases and should be considered incorrect.
