The code snippet `cost += one + 1` increments the value of `cost` by the value of `one` plus 1. The initial state specifies that `s` is a binary string with a length of at least 1, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. However, the values of `cost` and `one` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 1; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `cost` is increased by `one + 1`.**
