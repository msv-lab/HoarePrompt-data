Let's carefully review the provided code, problem description, and the function summary to ensure the assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The optimal strategy involves moving '0's past '1's with the least cost.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting Requirement**: The final sorted string will be of the form `000...000111...111`.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of moving a '0' past a '1' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (for the operation itself).
3. **Greedy Approach**: The provided code uses a greedy approach where it counts the number of '1's encountered and adds the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after any '1's.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost as follows:
- It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered (`one > 0`), it adds the cost `one + 1` to the total cost.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `one` is incremented to 1.
   - When encountering '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's encountered, so no cost.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Two '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 3 = 5` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Two more '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `4 + 1 = 5`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 4 + 5 = 11` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the function. The function iterates through the string, counts the number of '1's, and calculates the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after any '1's. The cost is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
