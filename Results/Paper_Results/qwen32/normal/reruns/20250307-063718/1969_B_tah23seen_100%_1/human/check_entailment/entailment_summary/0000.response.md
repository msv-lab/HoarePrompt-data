### Reasoning:

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum cost required to sort a given binary string `s` in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The algorithm works by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`). Whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's seen so far plus one.

Hereâ€™s how the algorithm works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, representing the total cost of operations.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, representing the count of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's seen before (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

The logic behind adding `one + 1` to the cost when encountering a '0' after some '1's is based on the fact that to move the '0' past all the '1's before it, a series of cyclic shifts must be performed, each costing `one + 1` in total.

### Example Analysis:

Let's analyze the third test case from the problem statement: `s = "11000"`.

- Initially, `cost = 0` and `one = 0`.
- Iteration 1: `s[0] = '1'`, `one = 1`.
- Iteration 2: `s[1] = '1'`, `one = 2`.
- Iteration 3: `s[2] = '0'`, since `one > 0`, `cost += one + 1 = 3`, making `cost = 3`.
- Iteration 4: `s[3] = '0'`, since `one > 0`, `cost += one + 1 = 3`, making `cost = 6`.
- Iteration 5: `s[4] = '0'`, since `one > 0`, `cost += one + 1 = 3`, making `cost = 9`.

The total cost calculated is 9, which matches the expected output for this test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the described algorithm to compute the minimum cost required to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified operations. The logic and the implementation align with the problem's requirements.
