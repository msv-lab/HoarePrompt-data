### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program is correct for the given problem. The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost, where the cost is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

#### Problem Analysis:
The final sorted string for a binary string will be of the form `000...000111...111`. The goal is to determine the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts to achieve this sorted order with the least cost.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of moving a '0' past a '1' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (for the operation itself).
2. **Greedy Approach**: The provided code uses a greedy approach where it counts the number of '1's encountered and adds the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after any '1's.

#### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost as follows:
- It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered (`one > 0`), it adds the cost `one + 1` to the total cost.

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `one` is incremented to 1.
   - When encountering '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's encountered, so no cost.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Two '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 3 = 5` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - One '1' encountered initially.
   - When encountering the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Two more '1's encountered.
   - When encountering the second '0', cost is `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - One more '1' encountered.
   - When encountering the third '0', cost is `4 + 1 = 5`.
   - Total cost: `2 + 4 + 5 = 11` (Correct)

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- **State before function call**: `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
- **State inside `func_1`**: `cost` is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's, and `one` is the count of trailing '1's in `s`.
- **State after function call**: The function returns `cost`, which is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's in the string `s`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations. The annotations align with the logic of the code and the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
