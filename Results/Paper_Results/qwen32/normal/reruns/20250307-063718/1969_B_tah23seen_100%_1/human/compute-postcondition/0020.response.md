To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `cost` and `one` are updated based on the binary string `s`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s`: a binary string.
   - `cost`: 0.
   - `one`: 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment `one` by 1.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost` and reset `one` to 0.

3. **Final State**:
   - `cost`: This variable accumulates the sum of `one + 1` each time a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0.
   - `one`: This variable counts the consecutive '1's encountered before a '0'. If the string ends with '1's, `one` will retain the count of these trailing '1's.

Given the loop behavior, after all iterations:
- `one` will be the count of trailing '1's in the string `s`.
- `cost` will be the total cost calculated based on the occurrences of '0's and the preceding counts of '1's.

Let's formalize the final state:

**Output State**: **`one` is the count of trailing '1's in `s`, and `cost` is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's.**

To illustrate this, let's consider an example:

For `s = "1101011"`, the loop would execute as follows:
1. `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
2. `i = '1'`: `one = 2`
3. `i = '0'`: `cost = 2 + 1 = 3`, `one = 0`
4. `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
5. `i = '0'`: `cost = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5`, `one = 0`
6. `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
7. `i = '1'`: `one = 2`

Final Output State: `cost = 5`, `one = 2`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`cost` is the accumulated cost based on the occurrences of '0's and preceding counts of '1's, and `one` is the count of trailing '1's in `s`.**
