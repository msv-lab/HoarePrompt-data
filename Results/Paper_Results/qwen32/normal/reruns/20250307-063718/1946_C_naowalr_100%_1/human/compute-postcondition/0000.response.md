The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. The loop will execute if the number of test cases (the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`) is greater than 0. Since the variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the number of test cases is greater than 0.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
