The loop head in this case involves the variable `_` and the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop continuation condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must have been 1, and the `solve()` function was called. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must now return a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the next call to `int(sys.stdin.readline())` returns a value greater than 0. Since we are not given any specific constraints on what this value should be other than it must be greater than 0, we can assume it could be any positive integer. For simplicity, let's assume it could be 1 again.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be 1**
