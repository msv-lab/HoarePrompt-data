To solve this, we need to understand the impact of the `solve()` function. However, since the function `solve()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume it modifies the state based on the precondition given.

Given the initial state and the precondition that `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be 1, we can infer that the function `solve()` might depend on this value. However, as we don't have the definition of `solve()`, we can only state that `solve()` has been executed.

Since the problem statement does not specify any changes to variables or return values from the `solve()` function, we can only conclude that the function has been called, and no other variables have been explicitly modified in the given snippet.

Output State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be 1; `solve()` has been executed.**
