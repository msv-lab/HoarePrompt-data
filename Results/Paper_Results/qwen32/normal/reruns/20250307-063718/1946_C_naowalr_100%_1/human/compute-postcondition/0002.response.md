In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at least once. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop control variable and the condition that keeps the loop running.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, its value does not affect the loop's behavior. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations (determined by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`) is greater than 0.

Let's denote the number read from `sys.stdin.readline()` as `num_iterations`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_iterations` was greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_iterations` must still be greater than 0. After each iteration, `num_iterations` is implicitly decremented by 1 (since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(num_iterations)`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num_iterations` must be exactly 1 less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be 1**
