To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. This variable `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `x` is the first integer from the input.
3. `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.
4. `i` is the original value of `x` before the input was read. However, since `x` is reassigned to the first integer from the input, `i` is not relevant to the output of the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the values of `x` and `y`.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input, and it is guaranteed to be between 0 and 9 inclusive.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the values of `x` and `y` as provided by the input. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9)**
