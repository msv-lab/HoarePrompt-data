To determine what will be printed, let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases or iterations but is not used in the print statement.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so we will refer to them by their names.
- `i` is `i + 1`. This line suggests that `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the print statement.

Print Statement:
```
print(y, x)
```

The print statement will output the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are the two integers read from the input)**
