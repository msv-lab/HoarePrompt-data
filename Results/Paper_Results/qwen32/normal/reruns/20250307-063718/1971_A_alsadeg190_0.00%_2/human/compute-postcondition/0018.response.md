To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and effects of the loop based on the provided initial and intermediate output states. 

Here's a breakdown of the loop:

- The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the first integer from the input.
- In each iteration, two integers `x` and `y` are read from the input.
- The loop prints `x y` if `x > y`, otherwise it prints `y x`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop processes `x` pairs of integers and prints the pairs in a specific order based on the comparison of `x` and `y`.

### Output State after All Iterations

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `x` pairs of integers. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will have been updated in each iteration based on the input, but the key point is that the loop will have completed all `x` iterations.

The loop head variable `i` will have reached the value of `x` (since `i` ranges from 0 to `x-1`), and the values of `x` and `y` will reflect the last pair of integers read from the input.

### Final Output State

- `t` remains the same as the initial value since it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `i` will be equal to `x` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x and y are the last pair of integers read from the input, and i is equal to the original value of x before the loop started.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` are the last values read from the input, and the loop index `i` will be equal to the number of iterations, which is the original value of `x`.
