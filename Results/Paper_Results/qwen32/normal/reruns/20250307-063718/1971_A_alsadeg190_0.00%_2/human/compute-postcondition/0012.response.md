Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is the original value of `x` before the input was read. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of whether `x` is greater than `y` or not.**
