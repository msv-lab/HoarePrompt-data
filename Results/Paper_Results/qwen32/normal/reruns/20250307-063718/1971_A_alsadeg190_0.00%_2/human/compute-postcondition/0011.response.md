The initial state provides us with the following information:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
2. `x` is the first integer from the input.
3. `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.
4. `i` is the original value of `x` before the input was read. However, `i` is not used in the print statement, so it is not relevant for determining the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

From the initial state, we know that `y` is the second integer from the input, and `x` is the first integer from the input. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
