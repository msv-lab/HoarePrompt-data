Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. Instead, it outputs the larger number first and the smaller number second. 

For example, consider the input pair `1 9`. According to the problem description, the output should be `1 9` (minimum first, then maximum). However, the program will output `9 1` because it checks if `x > y` and prints `x y` if true, otherwise `y x`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to print the minimum and maximum in the correct order:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

This corrected version will ensure that for every pair of integers, the minimum is printed first followed by the maximum.
