Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

We are only concerned with the values of `x` and `y` for the `print` statement. The variable `t` and the operation on `i` do not affect the output of the `print(x, y)` statement.

The `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of `x` and `y` as they are read from the input.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the two integers read from the input)**
