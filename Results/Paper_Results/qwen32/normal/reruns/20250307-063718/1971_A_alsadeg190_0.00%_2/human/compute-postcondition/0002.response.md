The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new input values.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `x` is an integer that is initially provided. However, the code snippet does not involve `t` and will only affect `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.**
