Reasoning:  
The provided code logic is incorrect based on the problem description. The task requires that for each test case, the program outputs the minimum of the two integers followed by the maximum of the two integers. However, the code currently prints the larger integer first and the smaller integer second, which is the opposite of what is required.

For example, given the input `1 9`, the correct output should be `1 9`, but the code will output `9 1`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
