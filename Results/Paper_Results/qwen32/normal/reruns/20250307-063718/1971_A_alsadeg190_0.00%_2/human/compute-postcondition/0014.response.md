The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
