Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.
- `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

Since `x` and `y` are the first and second integers from the input respectively, and we know that `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the output will simply be the values of `y` and `x` printed in that order.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input such that x ≤ y)**
