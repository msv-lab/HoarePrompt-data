The `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of `x` and `y`. Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `x` is the first integer from the input, and it is guaranteed to be greater than `y`.
- `y` is the second integer from the input, and it is guaranteed to be such that \(0 \leq y \leq 9\).

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9 and x > y)**
