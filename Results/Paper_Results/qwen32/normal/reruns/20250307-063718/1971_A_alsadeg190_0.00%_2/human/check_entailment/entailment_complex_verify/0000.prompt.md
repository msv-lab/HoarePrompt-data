You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two space-separated integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x and y are the last pair of integers read from the input, and i is equal to the original value of x before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. Instead, it outputs the larger number first and the smaller number second. 

For example, consider the input pair `1 9`. According to the problem description, the output should be `1 9` (minimum first, then maximum). However, the program will output `9 1` because it checks if `x > y` and prints `x y` if true, otherwise `y x`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to print the minimum and maximum in the correct order:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

This corrected version will ensure that for every pair of integers, the minimum is printed first followed by the maximum.
