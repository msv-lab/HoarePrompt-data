The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the initial values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, `x` and `y` were previously defined with specific conditions. However, after executing the code snippet, `x` and `y` take on the new values provided by the input, and these new values must adhere to the constraints given in the initial state (0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `x` can be greater than or less than or equal to `y`).

The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, `i` is the original value of `x` before the input was read.**
