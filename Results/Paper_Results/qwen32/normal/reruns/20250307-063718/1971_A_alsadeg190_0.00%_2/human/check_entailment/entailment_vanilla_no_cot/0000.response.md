Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the `if` condition. It should print the minimum value followed by the maximum value, but the current implementation does the opposite when `x > y`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

In this corrected version, if `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`, which is the correct order (minimum followed by maximum). If `x` is not greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`, which is also correct.
