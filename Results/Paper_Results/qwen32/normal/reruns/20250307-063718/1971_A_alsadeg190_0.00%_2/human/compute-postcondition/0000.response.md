The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state mentions `t` as an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the provided code snippet only redefines `x` without considering the initial state of `x` and `y` for the test cases. Therefore, `x` will be updated to the new input value, and `y` remains unchanged as per the information provided. The value of `t` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two space-separated integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9; `x` is an input integer.**
