The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one less than `x` since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.
- `x` is either greater than `y` or less than or equal to `y`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been `x - 1` for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, `x` is either greater than `y` or less than or equal to `y`, `i` is `x`**
