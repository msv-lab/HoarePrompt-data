The only variable in the loop head is `i` from the `range(x)`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

From the problem statement, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9.
- `i` is the original value of `x` before the input was read, but `i` in the loop head is the loop variable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on the value of the loop variable, which means it would have been incremented from its value at the start of that iteration. To execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, it would have been `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is the loop variable which is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given that `i` in the loop head is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value in the loop**.

However, to be more precise and in line with the format provided:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since `i` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, it would be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` is the loop variable and it starts from 0 in the first iteration, if it was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it would be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more precise and in line with the format provided, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value in the loop**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
