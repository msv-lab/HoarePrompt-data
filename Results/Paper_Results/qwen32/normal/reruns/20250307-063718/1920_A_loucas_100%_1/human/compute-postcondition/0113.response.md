The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. This means that `no` will no longer be an empty list but will contain the value `a` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial states.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value `a`, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is an input integer**.
