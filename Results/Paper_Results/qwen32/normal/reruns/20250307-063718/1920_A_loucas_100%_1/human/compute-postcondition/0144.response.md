Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 2` if `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, otherwise `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `num` being `min(less) - max(big) - 2` or `min(less) - max(big) - 1` are based on the value of `i` relative to `min(less)` and `max(big)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
