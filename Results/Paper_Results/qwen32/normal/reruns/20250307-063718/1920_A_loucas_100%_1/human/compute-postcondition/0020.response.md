The code snippet provided is `big.append(a)`, which appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. 

Given the initial state, if `x` equals 1, `big` initially contains the value of `a`. If `x` does not equal 1, `big` is initially an empty list. After executing `big.append(a)`, `big` will contain the value of `a` regardless of the initial state of `big`.

The values of other variables (`loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `x`, `a`, `less`, `no`, `iterable2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists (if `x` was not 1 initially, `less` and `no` remain empty; if `x` was 1 initially, `less` and `no` were already empty), `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and it must be less than `innerLoop`.**
