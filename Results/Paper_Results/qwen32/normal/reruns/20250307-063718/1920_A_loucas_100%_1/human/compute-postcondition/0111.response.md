The code snippet `less.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `less` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `less` will contain one element, which is the value of `a`.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `x` is 2, `a` is an input integer**.
