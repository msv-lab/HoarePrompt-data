Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, and `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.**

The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
