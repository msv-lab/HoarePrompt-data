The code snippet `big.append(a)` will add the value of `a` to the list `big`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `x` equals 1, `big` initially contains the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists.
- If `x` equals 2, `less` initially contains the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists.
- Otherwise, `no` initially contains the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

After executing `big.append(a)`, the list `big` will have an additional element `a` appended to it. The other variables (`loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `x`, `a`, `less`, `no`, `iterable2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` and possibly other elements from previous iterations, `less` and `no` are empty lists if `x` was 1, or `big` and `no` are empty lists if `x` was 2, or `big` and `less` are empty lists if `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and it must be less than `innerLoop`.**
