Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, and `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `num` is less than 1, then the condition is met as described.**
