Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
