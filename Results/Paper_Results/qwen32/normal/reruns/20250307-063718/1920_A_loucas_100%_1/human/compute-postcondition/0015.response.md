The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the `no` list. The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is the second integer from the input**.
