Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one element `[a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
