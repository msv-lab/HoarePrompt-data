Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` equals 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` equals 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
