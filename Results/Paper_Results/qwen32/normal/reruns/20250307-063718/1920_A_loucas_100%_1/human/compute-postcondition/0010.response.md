Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` equals 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `a` has been appended to the list `big`, so `big` now contains the value of `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
