The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `big` will contain one element, which is the value of `a`.

Here are the changes:
- `big` is now a list containing one element, which is `a`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer.**
