Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, and `no` is a list containing at least one `a` value where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. The current value of `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**
