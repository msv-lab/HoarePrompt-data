The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. 

Given the initial state:
- `big` contains `a` if `x` is 1 (now `big` contains `a` twice if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` once).
- `a` is the second input integer.

After appending `a` to `big`:
- If `x` was initially 1, `big` will now contain `a` three times.
- If `x` was not initially 1, `big` will now contain `a` twice.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` twice, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise an empty list, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise an empty list, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.**
