The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `no` will contain one element, which is the value of `a`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the value `a`; `x` is an input integer not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is an input integer**.
