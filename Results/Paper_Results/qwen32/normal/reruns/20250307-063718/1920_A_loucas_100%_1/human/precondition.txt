t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. constraints is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, followed by n pairs of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints in the same test case are the same (i.e., all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
