Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 1` or `min(less) - max(big) - 1` based on the condition involving `i` if `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive. `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, `no` is a list containing at least one `a` value where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is the next element in `no`. If `i` is not between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive, `num` remains unchanged.**
