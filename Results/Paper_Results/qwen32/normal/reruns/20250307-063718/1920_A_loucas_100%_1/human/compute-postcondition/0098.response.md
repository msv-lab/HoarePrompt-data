To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **`loop`**: An integer greater than 0.
2. **`iterable`**: This is defined as `iterable + len(no)`. However, the initial value of `iterable` is not provided, and it seems to be modified in this way. Since its initial value is not given, we can't determine its exact value. But it's not used in the calculation of `num`, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`num`**: This is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`.
   - **`less`**: A list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`.
   - **`big`**: A list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`.
   - **`no`**: A list containing all `a` values where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.
   - **`count`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a known value or is provided as input. Without the exact value of `count`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `num`.
4. **`innerLoop`**: An input integer, but it is not used in the calculation of `num`.

Given the information, we can describe the value of `num` as follows:
- `min(less)`: The smallest value in the list `less`.
- `max(big)`: The largest value in the list `big`.
- `count`: A variable whose value is not specified, so we denote it as `count`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be the result of the expression `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count)**
