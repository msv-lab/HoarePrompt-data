You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Constraints Types:**
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`
2. **Objective:** 
   - Find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
3. **Guarantees:**
   - There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2.
   - No two constraints are exactly the same.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - Then, it reads each constraint and categorizes them into three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` based on the type of constraint.

2. **Range Calculation:**
   - It calculates the smallest upper bound (`min(less)`) and the largest lower bound (`max(big)`).
   - The potential range of `k` is then calculated as `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
   - If this range is less than 1, it means there are no valid integers `k` and it prints `0`.

3. **Exclusion of Invalid `k` Values:**
   - For each value in the `no` list, it checks if the value lies within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.
   - If it does, it decrements `num` by 1, effectively excluding that value from the valid range.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Range Calculation:** The calculation `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` correctly determines the number of integers that can satisfy the constraints of type 1 and type 2.
- **Exclusion of Invalid `k` Values:** The program correctly iterates through the `no` list and excludes any value that falls within the valid range.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `num < 1`) by printing `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. It handles all specified cases, including edge cases where the range is invalid or where there are no valid integers `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
