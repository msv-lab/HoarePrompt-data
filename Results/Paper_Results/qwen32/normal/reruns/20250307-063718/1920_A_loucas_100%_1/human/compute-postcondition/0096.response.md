Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 2` or `min(less) - max(big) - 2` based on the condition involving `next_i` if `next_i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive. `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, `no` is a list containing at least one `a` value where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is `next_i`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive, `num` is adjusted by subtracting 2 from its initial value. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.**
