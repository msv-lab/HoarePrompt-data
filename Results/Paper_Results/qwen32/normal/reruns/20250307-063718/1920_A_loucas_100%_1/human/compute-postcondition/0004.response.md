The code snippet provided initializes a new list `no` as an empty list. However, this does not affect the other variables `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, and `big`, which retain their initial states.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**
