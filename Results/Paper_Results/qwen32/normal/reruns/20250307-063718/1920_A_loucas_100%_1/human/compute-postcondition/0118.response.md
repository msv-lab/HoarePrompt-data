The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given the initial state, `big` either contains the value `a` (if `x` is 1) or is an empty list (if `x` is not 1). After appending `a`, `big` will definitely contain `a` as its last element.

Therefore, the updated state of `big` will be:
- If `x` was 1 initially, `big` will now contain `a` twice.
- If `x` was not 1 initially, `big` will now contain `a` once.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` was 1 initially (now `big` contains `a` twice), otherwise `big` is a list containing `a` (now `big` contains `a` once), `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`.**
