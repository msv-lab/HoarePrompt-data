The code snippet `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `no`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they were dependent on the value of `no`, which they are not in this case.

Given the initial state, `no` was either an empty list or contained the value of `a` if `x` was not equal to 1 or 2. After executing the code, `no` will definitely contain the value of `a`.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list (possibly empty), `less` is a list (possibly empty), `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and it must be less than `innerLoop`.**
