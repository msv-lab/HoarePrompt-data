Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` twice if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` once, `less` contains `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` contains `a` twice if `x` was initially not 2, `no` contains `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` contains `a` twice if `x` was initially not 2, or `no` contains `a` once if `x` was initially not equal to 1 or 2, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.**

To simplify the description:

Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains `a` three times if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` twice, `less` contains `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` contains `a` twice, `no` contains `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` contains `a` twice, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.**
