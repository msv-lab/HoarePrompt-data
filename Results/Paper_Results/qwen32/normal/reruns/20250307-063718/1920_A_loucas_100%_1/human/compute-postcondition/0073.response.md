Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`, `x` and `a` are the two integers read from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a]`, `less` is `[a]`, and `no` is `[a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is 2, `big` is `[a]`, `less` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is `[a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` is `[a]` if `x` is 1, `less` is `[a]` if `x` is not 2, and `no` is `[a, a]`. The other lists are empty.**
