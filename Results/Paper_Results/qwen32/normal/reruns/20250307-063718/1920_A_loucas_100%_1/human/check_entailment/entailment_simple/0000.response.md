### Reasoning:

The given program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then iterates over these `n` constraints and categorizes them into three lists:
     - `less`: stores the upper bounds (type 2 constraints).
     - `big`: stores the lower bounds (type 1 constraints).
     - `no`: stores the values that `k` must not be equal to (type 3 constraints).

2. **Calculating the Range:**
   - The program calculates the potential range of valid `k` values by finding the difference between the smallest upper bound (`min(less)`) and the largest lower bound (`max(big)`) and adding 1. This gives the number of integers between these bounds, inclusive.
   - If the calculated range (`num`) is less than 1, it means the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 4`), so the program outputs `0`.

3. **Adjusting for `k != x` Constraints:**
   - For each value in the `no` list, the program checks if it falls within the valid range calculated in the previous step. If it does, it decrements the count `num` by 1, as that value cannot be `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the adjusted count `num` for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the first test case from the example to ensure the logic holds:

- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  1 3
  2 10
  3 1
  3 5
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - `less` = [10]
  - `big` = [3]
  - `no` = [1, 5]
  - Calculate `num` = `min(less) - max(big) + 1` = `10 - 3 + 1` = `8`
  - Adjust for `no`:
    - `1` is not in the range [3, 10], so `num` remains 8.
    - `5` is in the range [3, 10], so `num` is decremented by 1 to 7.
- **Output:**
  ```
  7
  ```

The program correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem requirements, and it correctly handles the provided example and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
