Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` equals 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` equals 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists if `x` was not 2, or `big` and `no` remain as per their initial state if `x` was 2. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists if `x` was not 1 or 2, or `no` contains an additional value of `a` if `x` was 1 or 2. `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and it must be less than `innerLoop`.**
