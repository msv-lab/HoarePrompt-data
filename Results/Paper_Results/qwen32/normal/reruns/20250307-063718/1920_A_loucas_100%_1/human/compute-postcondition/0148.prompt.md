Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9). The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint: if `a`=1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a`=2, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a`=3, `k` must be not equal to `x`. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count` where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that are within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 across all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no)`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 1`, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x == 2`, and `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable_initial + len(no)^2 + len(no)`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k` where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `max(big) <= i <= min(less)`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
