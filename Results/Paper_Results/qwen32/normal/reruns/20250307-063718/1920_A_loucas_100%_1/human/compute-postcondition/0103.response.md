The code snippet sets `num` to 0. The other variables (`loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, and `no`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list.**
