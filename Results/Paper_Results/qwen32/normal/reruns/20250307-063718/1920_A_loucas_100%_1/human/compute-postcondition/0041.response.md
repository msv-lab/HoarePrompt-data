Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element. If `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` retains its original value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.**
