The code snippet `no.append(a)` modifies the list `no` by adding the value of `a` to it. Given the initial state, `no` is a list containing the value `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list. After executing the code, `no` will definitely contain the value `a` regardless of the initial value of `x`.

Here is the updated output state:
Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value `a`, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`.**
