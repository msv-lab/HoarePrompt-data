Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer.**
