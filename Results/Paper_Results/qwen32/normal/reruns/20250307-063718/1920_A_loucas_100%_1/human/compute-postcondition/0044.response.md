Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is updated to `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.**
