Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `no = []` resets the list `no` to an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
