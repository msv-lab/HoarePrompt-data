Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 across all iterations. If `num` is less than 1, the state remains as described. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the loop completes.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element. If `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` retains its original value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is updated to `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is updated to `min(less) - max(big)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
