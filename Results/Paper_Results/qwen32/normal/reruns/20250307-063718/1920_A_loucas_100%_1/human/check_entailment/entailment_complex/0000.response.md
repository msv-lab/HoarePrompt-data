### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `loop`.
   - For each test case, it initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no`, to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.

2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint in the test case, it reads the type `x` and the value `a`.
   - Depending on the type `x`, it appends the value `a` to the respective list:
     - If `x == 1`, it means `k` must be greater than or equal to `a`, so `a` is added to `big`.
     - If `x == 2`, it means `k` must be less than or equal to `a`, so `a` is added to `less`.
     - If `x == 3`, it means `k` must not be equal to `a`, so `a` is added to `no`.

3. **Calculating the Range**:
   - It calculates the number of integers `k` that can satisfy the constraints by finding the range between the maximum value in `big` and the minimum value in `less`.
   - The formula used is `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This gives the count of integers from the maximum of the "greater than or equal to" constraints to the minimum of the "less than or equal to" constraints, inclusive.

4. **Adjusting for "Not Equal" Constraints**:
   - If the calculated range `num` is less than 1, it means there are no integers that satisfy the constraints, so it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over the `no` list and decrements `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the result `num` for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. It handles the three types of constraints appropriately and adjusts the count based on the "not equal" constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
