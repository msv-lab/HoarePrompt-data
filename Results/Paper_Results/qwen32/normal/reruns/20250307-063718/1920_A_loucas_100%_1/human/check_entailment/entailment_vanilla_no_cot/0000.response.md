Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the line `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` is incorrect. It should be `num = max(big) - min(less) + 1`. This is because `max(big)` gives the smallest value that `k` can be (since `k` must be greater than or equal to all values in `big`), and `min(less)` gives the largest value that `k` can be (since `k` must be less than or equal to all values in `less`). The number of integers between these two values (inclusive) is `max(big) - min(less) + 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.append(x)
        num = max(big) - min(less) + 1
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected version should now properly calculate the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
