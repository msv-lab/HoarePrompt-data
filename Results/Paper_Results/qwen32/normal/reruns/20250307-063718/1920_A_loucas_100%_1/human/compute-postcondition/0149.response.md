The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint: if `a=1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a=2`, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a=3`, `k` must be not equal to `x`. The function evaluates these constraints for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it evaluates `n` constraints on an integer `k`. It returns True if there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all constraints in the test case; otherwise, it returns False.**
