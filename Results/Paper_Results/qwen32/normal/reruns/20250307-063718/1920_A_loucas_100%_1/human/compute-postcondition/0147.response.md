To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the definition of the variable `num`.

From the initial state:
- `num` is defined as `min(less) - max(big) - k`.
- `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `max(big) <= i <= min(less)`.

Let's break down what this means:
1. **`min(less)`**: This is the smallest value in the list `less`.
2. **`max(big)`**: This is the largest value in the list `big`.
3. **`k`**: This is the count of elements in the list `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

Since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `num`. However, we can describe the value of `num` in terms of these lists.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- `min(less)` is the smallest value found in the list `less`.
- `max(big)` is the largest value found in the list `big`.
- `k` is the number of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.

The final value of `num` is the result of subtracting `max(big)` and `k` from `min(less)`.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as min(less) - max(big) - k, with k being the count of elements in no that satisfy max(big) <= i <= min(less))**
