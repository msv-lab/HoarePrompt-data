Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` unless `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, in which case `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains at least one element. If `i` is within the range `max(big) <= i <= min(less)`, then `num` is updated to `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` retains its original value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.**
