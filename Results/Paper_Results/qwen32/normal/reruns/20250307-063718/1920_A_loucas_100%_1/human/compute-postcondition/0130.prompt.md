Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1 (now `big` contains `a` twice if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` once), `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise an empty list, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise an empty list, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains `a` three times if `x` was initially 1, otherwise `big` contains `a` twice, `less` contains `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` contains `a` twice, `no` contains `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` contains `a` twice, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
