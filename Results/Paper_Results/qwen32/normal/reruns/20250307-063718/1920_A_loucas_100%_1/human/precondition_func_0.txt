Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The integer a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
