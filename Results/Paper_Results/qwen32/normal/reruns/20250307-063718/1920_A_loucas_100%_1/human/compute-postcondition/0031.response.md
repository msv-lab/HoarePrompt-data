Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements from previous iterations, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` equals 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements from previous iterations, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements from previous iterations, and `big` and `less` are empty lists. `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and it must be less than `innerLoop`.**
