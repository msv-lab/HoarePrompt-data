The code snippet provided is `num -= 1`, which means the value of `num` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `num` was calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After decrementing, `num` will be `min(less) - max(big)`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + len(no) + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains at least one element, and `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**.
