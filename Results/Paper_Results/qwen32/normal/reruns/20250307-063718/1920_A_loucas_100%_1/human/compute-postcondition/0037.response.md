Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 across all iterations. If `num` is less than 1, the state remains as described. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the loop completes.**
