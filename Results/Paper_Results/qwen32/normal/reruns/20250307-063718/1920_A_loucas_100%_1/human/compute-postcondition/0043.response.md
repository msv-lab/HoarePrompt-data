Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1 across all iterations, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2 across all iterations, `no` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
