You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The integer a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: `loop` is the total number of test cases, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists from the last test case, `num` is the result of the last test case, and `innerLoop` is the number of constraints in the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it evaluates `n` constraints on an integer `k`. It returns True if there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all constraints in the test case; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
