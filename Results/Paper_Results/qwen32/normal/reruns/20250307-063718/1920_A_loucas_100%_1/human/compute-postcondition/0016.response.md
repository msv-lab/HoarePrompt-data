Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is initialized by the range function starting from 0, `big` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value `a` and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing the value `a`.**
