Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count` where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that are within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 across all iterations.**

In natural language: The variable `big` has been reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
