The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
