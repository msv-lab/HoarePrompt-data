Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

### Key Points

1. **Subsequence**: A string `a` is a subsequence of another string `b` if `a` can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from `b` without changing the order of the remaining characters.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 26`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`
   - There are `k^n` possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
3. **Objective**: Find the smallest string `s` that contains all these `k^n` strings as subsequences.

### Given Program Analysis

The given program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then calls a function `func_1()` which constructs a string by taking the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and repeating them `n` times.

Let's look at the function `func_1()`:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **String Construction**: The string `s` is constructed by taking the first `k` characters from `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating them `n` times. This means the string will be of length `k * n` and will consist of the same sequence of `k` characters repeated `n` times.
2. **Subsequence Requirement**: The requirement is that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets should be subsequences of `s`. The given program does not ensure this. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will output `'aabb'` which does not contain all possible subsequences (`'aa'`, `'ab'`, `'ba'`, `'bb'`).

### Correctness Check

The program does not correctly generate a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
