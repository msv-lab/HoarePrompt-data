The code snippet reads two integers from the input, which are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
