The given initial state specifies that `L` is 50000. The `print(L)` statement directly prints the value of `L`.

Since `L` is explicitly given as 50000 in the initial state, there is no need to derive its value from any formula or condition.

Therefore, the `print(L)` statement will output the value of `L` which is 50000.

Output: **50000**
