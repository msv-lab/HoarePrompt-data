Postcondition: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `result_of_dfs`, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input, `x` is 50001, and either `numCuts` is less than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`)**
