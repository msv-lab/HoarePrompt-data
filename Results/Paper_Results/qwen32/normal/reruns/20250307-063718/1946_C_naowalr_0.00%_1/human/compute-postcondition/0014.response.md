The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the adjacency list for vertex `a` now includes vertex `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b` and now `adj[b]` also contains the integer `a`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is 2, and `adj[a]` includes `b`.**

In simple terms, after executing the code, the adjacency list for vertex `a` now includes vertex `b`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
