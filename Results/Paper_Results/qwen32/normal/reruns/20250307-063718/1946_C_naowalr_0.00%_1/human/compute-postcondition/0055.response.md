The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that `adj[b]` now contains `a` in addition to whatever it previously contained. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `b` and `adj[b]` which now contains `a` and `b`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
