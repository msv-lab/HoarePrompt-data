Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `i` is `n - 2`, and `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input; `L` is 1.**

In natural language: The variable `L` has been assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
