Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input.**

In this output state, the variable `numCuts` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial conditions.
