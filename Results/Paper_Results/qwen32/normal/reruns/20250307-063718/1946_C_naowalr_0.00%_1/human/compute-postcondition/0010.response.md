The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the list `adj[a]` now includes the integer `b` as an additional element. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b` and now `adj[b]` also contains the integer `a`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is incremented by 1, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element.**
