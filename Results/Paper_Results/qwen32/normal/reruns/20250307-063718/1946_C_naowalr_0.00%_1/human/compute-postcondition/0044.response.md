Based on the provided initial state, we know the following:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is the number of edges to be removed.
- `adj` is an adjacency list.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `z` is a loop variable.
- `i` is set to `n - 2`.
- `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are updated adjacency list entries.
- `L` and `R` are consecutive integers.
- `numCuts` is initialized to 0.

The specific values of `L` and `R` are not provided explicitly, but we know they are consecutive integers. Thus, the exact numerical value of `L` cannot be determined from the given information. However, we can describe the output in terms of `L`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(L)
```

This statement will print the value of `L`, which is a consecutive integer.

Output: **L (where L is a consecutive integer)**
