The code snippet provided initializes the adjacency list `adj` to be a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means that `adj` will have `n + 1` empty lists, indexed from 0 to `n`.

Given that the initial state specifies that `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, the code modifies `adj` by reassigning it to a new list of empty lists. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the conditions `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is the number of vertices in the tree as read from input, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment.**
