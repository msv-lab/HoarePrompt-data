The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending `b` to the list at index `a`. This means that the list `adj[a]` will now contain `b` in addition to whatever it already contained (which was `[b]` based on the initial state).

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `a` and `b`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
