The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged. The new values of `a` and `b` will be the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are not yet updated in this new `adj`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
