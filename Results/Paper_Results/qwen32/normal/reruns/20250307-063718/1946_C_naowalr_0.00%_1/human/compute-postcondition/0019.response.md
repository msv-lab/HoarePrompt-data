The provided code snippet initializes a variable `numCuts` to 0. The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency of vertices, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is a loop variable, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.**
