Output State: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` must be less than 50000, `numCuts` is 0, and `R` must be at least `L + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
