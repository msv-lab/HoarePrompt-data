The given code snippet only resets the value of `numCuts` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input, `x` is 50001**.
