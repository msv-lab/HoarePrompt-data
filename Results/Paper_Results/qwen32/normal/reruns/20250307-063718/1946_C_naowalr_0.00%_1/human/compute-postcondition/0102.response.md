The code snippet provided is `adj[a].append(b)`, which modifies the list `adj` by appending the value `b` to the sublist at index `a`. The other variables (`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`) remain unchanged. 

The output state will reflect the updated `adj` list with the new value appended to the sublist at index `a`.

Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` now includes `a`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms: The list `adj` has been updated such that `b` has been appended to the sublist at index `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
