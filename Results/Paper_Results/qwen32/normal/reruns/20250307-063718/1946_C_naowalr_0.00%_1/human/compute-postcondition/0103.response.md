Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b` and the sublist at index `b` now includes `a`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**

Natural Language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the sublist at index `b` in the `adj` list now includes the integer `a`. All other variables (`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `a`) retain their previous values.
