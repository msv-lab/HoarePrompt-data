To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `R - L > 1`. We must ensure that this condition holds true after the previous iteration's state.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `x` are defined based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`.

We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` holds true. Let's analyze the possible states of `L` and `R`:

1. **Case 1: If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`):**
   - `L` is set to 25001.
   - `R` is set to 100001.
   - Here, `R - L` is `100001 - 25001 = 75000`, which is greater than 1. No adjustment is needed.

2. **Case 2: Otherwise:**
   - `L` is set to 50001.
   - `R` is set to `x`.
   - If `x` is 75001 (as per the provided conditions), then `R - L` is `75001 - 50001 = 25000`, which is greater than 1. No adjustment is needed.
   - If `x` is 25001, then `R - L` is `25001 - 50001 = -25000`, which is not greater than 1. In this case, we need to adjust `R` to be greater than `L + 1`. We can set `R` to 50002 to ensure `R - L > 1`.

Given the above analysis, we need to ensure that `R` is adjusted to be greater than `L + 1` in the case where `x` is 25001. No other adjustments are necessary because the other conditions already ensure `R - L > 1`.

State: **`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `x` are defined as follows: If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 25001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 25001. Otherwise, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002 if `x` is 25001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**
