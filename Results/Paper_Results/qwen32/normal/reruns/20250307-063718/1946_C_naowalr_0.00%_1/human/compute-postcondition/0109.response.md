The code snippet assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Therefore, the calculation for `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals `50001`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input, `x` is 50001**.
