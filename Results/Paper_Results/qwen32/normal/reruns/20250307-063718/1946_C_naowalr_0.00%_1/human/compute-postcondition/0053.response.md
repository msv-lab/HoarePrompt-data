The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged. The only change is that `a` and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `b` and `adj[b]` which now contains `a`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
