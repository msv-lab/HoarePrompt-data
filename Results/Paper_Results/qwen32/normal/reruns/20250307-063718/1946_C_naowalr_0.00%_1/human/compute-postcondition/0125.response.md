To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the code modifies the variables. The value of `x` is recalculated based on the average of `L` and `R` using integer division. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial State Conditions:**
   - If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`):
     - `L` is 25001
     - `R` is 100001
     - `numCuts` is 0
     - `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`
     - `x` is 25001
   - Otherwise:
     - `L` is 50001 if `x` is 25001, otherwise `L` is 1
     - `R` is 50002 if `x` is 25001, otherwise `R` is 50001
     - `numCuts` is 0
     - `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`
     - `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `x` is 25001

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `x = (L + R) // 2`
     - If the first condition is true (`numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`)):
       - `x = (25001 + 100001) // 2 = 62501`
     - Otherwise:
       - If `x` is 25001:
         - `x = (50001 + 50002) // 2 = 50001` (unchanged)
       - Otherwise:
         - `x = (1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001` (unchanged)

3. **Output State:**
   - If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`):
     - `L` remains 25001
     - `R` remains 100001
     - `numCuts` remains 0
     - `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
     - `x` is now 62501
   - Otherwise:
     - `L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1
     - `R` remains 50002 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `R` remains 50001
     - `numCuts` remains 0
     - `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
     - `x` remains 25001

Given these conditions, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 25001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 62501. Otherwise, if `x` was 25001, then `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 25001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 25001.**
