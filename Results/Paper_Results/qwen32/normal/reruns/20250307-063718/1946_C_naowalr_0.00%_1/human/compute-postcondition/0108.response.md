To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `R - L > 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop
- `n` must be at least 2
- `k` will be the values read from the input
- `t` remains unchanged
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `z` is `z + (n - 1)`
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input

We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` holds true. Currently, `R` is 100001 and `L` is 1, so `R - L` is 100000, which is indeed greater than 1. Therefore, the loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the given initial state.

Since no adjustments are needed to satisfy the loop condition, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input**
