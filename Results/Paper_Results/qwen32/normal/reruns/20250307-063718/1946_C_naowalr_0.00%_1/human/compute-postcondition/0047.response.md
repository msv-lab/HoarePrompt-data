The code snippet `adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]` reassigns the variable `adj` to a new adjacency list. This new adjacency list is a list of empty lists, with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are not yet updated in this new `adj`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0.**
