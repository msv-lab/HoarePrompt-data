Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency of vertices, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is a loop variable, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. In this latter case, `R` is set to 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` must be less than 50000, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, and if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
