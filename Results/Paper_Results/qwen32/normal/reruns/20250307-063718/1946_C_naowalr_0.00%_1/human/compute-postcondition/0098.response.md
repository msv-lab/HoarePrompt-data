Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`, and the sublist at index `b` now includes `a`.**

The only change is that the adjacency list `adj` has been updated to include `b` in the sublist at index `a` and `a` in the sublist at index `b`. All other variables retain their previous values or states.
