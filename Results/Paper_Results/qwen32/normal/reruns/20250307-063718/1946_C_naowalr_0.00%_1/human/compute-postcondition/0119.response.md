Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` are as described in the precondition, `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**

Natural Language: The variable `numCuts` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described in the precondition. The value of `x` remains dependent on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`.
