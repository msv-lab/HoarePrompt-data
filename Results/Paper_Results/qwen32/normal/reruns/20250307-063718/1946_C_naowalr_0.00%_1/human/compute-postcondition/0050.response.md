Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `b`, `adj[b]` is not yet updated in this new `adj`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**

Natural Language: The adjacency list `adj` has been updated such that `adj[a]` now includes `b`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
