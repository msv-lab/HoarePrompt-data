Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to `x` and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to `x`. `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)` in both cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is `x` and `R` is `x`. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is `(1 + x) // 2`. In both cases, `x` is updated to `(1 + x) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `x` and `R` is updated to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is `L + 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
