Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `i` is `n - 2`, and `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will fully represent the tree structure with all the edges read from the input. The variable `i` will have reached `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has processed `n - 1` edges, which is the correct number of edges for a tree with `n` vertices. All other variables like `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
