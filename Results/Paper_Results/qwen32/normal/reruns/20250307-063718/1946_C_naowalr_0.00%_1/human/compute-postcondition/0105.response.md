Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `L` has been explicitly set to 1. Since the initial condition was `R = L + 1`, `R` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
