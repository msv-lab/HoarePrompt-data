To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `R - L > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the difference between `R` and `L` must be greater than 1.

Given the information:
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.

Let's analyze both scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1**: `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Here, `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001.
   - The difference `R - L` is `100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute again without any adjustments to `L` and `R`.

2. **Scenario 2**: Otherwise (i.e., `numCuts` is less than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).
   - Here, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.
   - The difference `R - L` is `50001 - 1 = 50000`, which is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute again without any adjustments to `L` and `R`.

In both scenarios, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied, and no adjustments are needed to the values of `L` and `R` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` are as described in the precondition, with `x` being 50001. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.**
