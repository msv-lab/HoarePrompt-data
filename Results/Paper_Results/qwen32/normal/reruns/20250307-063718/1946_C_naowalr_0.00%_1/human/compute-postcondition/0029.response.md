The `while` loop condition in this task is `R - L > 1`. To determine which states need to be adjusted, we need to focus on the variables `R` and `L` only.

Given:
- `R` is set to 50001 in two different cases.
- `L` is set to 50001 in one case.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true. This means that `R` should be greater than `L + 1`.

Since `R` is set to 50001 in some cases, and `L` is also set to 50001 in one case, we need to adjust these values to ensure that `R` is greater than `L + 1`.

To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we can set `R` to a value greater than `L + 1`. For example, if `L` is 50000, then `R` can be 50001 or greater.

However, based on the given information, since `R` is set to 50001 in some cases, we can adjust `L` to be less than 50000 to ensure `R - L > 1`.

Therefore, we can set `L` to a value less than 50000, for example, 50000, to ensure the condition `R - L > 1` holds true.

State: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. `L` must be less than 50000**
