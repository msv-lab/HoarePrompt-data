Postcondition: **`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `x` are defined as follows: If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 25001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 25001. Otherwise, `L` is 50001, `R` is `x`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**
