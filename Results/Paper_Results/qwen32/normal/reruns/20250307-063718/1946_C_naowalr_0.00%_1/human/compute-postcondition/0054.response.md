The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding `b` to the list at index `a`. This means that the list `adj[a]` now contains `b` in addition to whatever elements it previously held. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `b` and `adj[b]` which contains `a`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

In simpler terms, the adjacency list `adj` has been updated so that `adj[a]` includes `b`. All other variables retain their original values.
