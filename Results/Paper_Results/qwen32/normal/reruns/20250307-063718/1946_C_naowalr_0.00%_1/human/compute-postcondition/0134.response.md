Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `adj`, a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to its index. The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which could be a specific configuration of the remaining tree or a value indicating the outcome of the operation.**
