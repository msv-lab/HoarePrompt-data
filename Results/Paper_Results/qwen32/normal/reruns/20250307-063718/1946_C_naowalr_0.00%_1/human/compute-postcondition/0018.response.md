The code snippet assigns the integer value of `100000.0 + 1` to the variable `R`. This means `R` is now `100001`.

The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency of vertices, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is a loop variable, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input, and `L` is 1. All these conditions and variable states remain unchanged except for the new value assigned to `R`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency of vertices, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is a loop variable, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.**
