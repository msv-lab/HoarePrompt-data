The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variables `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `t`, `i`, `adj` remain unchanged, and `z` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `n`, `k`, and `z`. The values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `t`, `i`, `adj` remain the same. The variable `z` is incremented by 1, so if `z` was initially `z_initial`, it will now be `z_initial + 1`.

Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`; `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop; `n` and `k` will be the values read from the input; `t`, `i`, `adj` remain unchanged; `z` is `z + 1`.**
