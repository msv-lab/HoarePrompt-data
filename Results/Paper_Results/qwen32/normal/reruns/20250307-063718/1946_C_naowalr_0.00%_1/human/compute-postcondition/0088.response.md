Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `L` and `R` are such that `R = L + 1`.
- `numCuts` and `leftover` are determined by the last iteration of a loop, but they are not used in the print statement.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, and `adj` remain unchanged and are not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(L)
```

Since the initial state specifies that `R = L + 1`, we can infer that `L` is an integer, and `R` is the next consecutive integer. However, the exact value of `L` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `L`, but we know that it is an integer.

Output: **L (where L is an integer such that R = L + 1)**
