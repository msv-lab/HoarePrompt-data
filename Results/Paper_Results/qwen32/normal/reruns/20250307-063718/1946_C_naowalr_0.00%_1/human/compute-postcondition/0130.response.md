Postcondition: **`L` is 25001 and `R` is 50002 if `x` was 25001 and `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1; `R` is 25001; `numCuts` remains 0; `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` remains 25001.**
