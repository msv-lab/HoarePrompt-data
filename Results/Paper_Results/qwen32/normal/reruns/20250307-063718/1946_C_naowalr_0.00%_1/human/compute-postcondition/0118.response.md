To determine the new value of `x` and the state of other variables, we need to evaluate the condition that sets the values of `L` and `R`. The new value of `x` will be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2.

Given the initial state, `x` is initially set to 50001. The values of `L` and `R` are determined based on the conditions involving `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.

In either case, the new value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`.

### Case 1: `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`
- `L` is set to 50001.
- `R` is set to 100001.
- New `x` is `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 150002 // 2 = 75001`.

### Case 2: Otherwise
- `L` is set to 1.
- `R` is set to 50001.
- New `x` is `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 50002 // 2 = 25001`.

Since we do not know the exact values of `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover`, we must consider both cases.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
- If `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, then `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.

Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` are as described in the precondition, `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**
