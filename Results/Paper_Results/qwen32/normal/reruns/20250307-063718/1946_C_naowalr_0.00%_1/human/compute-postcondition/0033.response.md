Output State: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is now equal to `x`, `numCuts` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
