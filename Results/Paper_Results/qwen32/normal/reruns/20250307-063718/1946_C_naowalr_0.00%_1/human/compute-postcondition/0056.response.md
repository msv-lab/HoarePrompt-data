The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already `n - 1`, it means the loop will not execute again because `i` will be equal to `n - 1` and the condition `i < n - 1` will not be satisfied.

However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `i` would have been `n - 2`. So, to adjust the state for the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `n - 2`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `b` and `adj[b]` which now contains `a` and `b`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
