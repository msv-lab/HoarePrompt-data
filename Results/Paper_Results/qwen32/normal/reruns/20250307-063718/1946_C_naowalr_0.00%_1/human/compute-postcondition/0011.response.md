The code snippet provided appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list `adj[b]` will now include `a` as an additional element. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b` and now `adj[b]` also contains the integer `a`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is incremented by 1, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element.**
