To determine the output state, we need to consider the conditions provided in the initial state. Specifically, we need to evaluate the conditions:

1. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`):
   - `L` remains 25001
   - `R` remains 100001
   - `numCuts` remains 0
   - `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
   - `x` is now 62501

2. Otherwise:
   - `L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1
   - `R` remains 50002 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `R` remains 50001
   - `numCuts` remains 0
   - `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
   - `x` remains 25001

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover`, we cannot definitively determine whether the first condition is true or false. However, we can describe the output state based on both possible scenarios.

### If the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is true:
- `L` remains 25001
- `R` remains 100001
- `numCuts` remains 0
- `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
- `x` becomes 62501

### If the condition is false:
- `L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1
- `R` remains 50002 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `R` remains 50001
- `numCuts` remains 0
- `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`
- `x` remains 25001

Since we do not have specific values for `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover`, we cannot determine which scenario is true. However, we can provide the output state for both scenarios.

Let's assume the condition is false for the output state, as it is the most general case without additional information.

Output State: **`L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1; `R` remains 50002 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `R` remains 50001; `numCuts` remains 0; `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` remains 25001**.
