Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t`, `i` remain unchanged, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`, and the sublist at index `b` now includes `a`.**

The code appends `a` to the sublist at index `b` in the `adj` list, in addition to the existing state where `a` was appended to the sublist at index `b` in a previous step. All other variables remain unchanged.
