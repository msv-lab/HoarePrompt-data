The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b` and now `adj[b]` also contains the integer `a`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms: The values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, and `i` remain the same. The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the integer values read from the input.
