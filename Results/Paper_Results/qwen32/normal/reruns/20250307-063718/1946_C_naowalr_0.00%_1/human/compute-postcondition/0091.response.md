The code snippet provided initializes a list of lists named `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This means `adj` will have `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

The other variables (`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`) are not affected by this code snippet, and their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`; `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop; `n` and `k` will be the values read from the input; `t`, `i`, `z` remain unchanged; `z` is `z + 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**
