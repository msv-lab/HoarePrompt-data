Output State: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `L` is 50001, `R`, and `numCuts` might be updated, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Additionally, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the variable `L` has been updated to the value 50001. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions as described in the initial state.
