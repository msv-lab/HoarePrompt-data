The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `i`, `adj`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts`) remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0.**
