The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 again.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`, and the sublist at index `b` now includes `a`.**
