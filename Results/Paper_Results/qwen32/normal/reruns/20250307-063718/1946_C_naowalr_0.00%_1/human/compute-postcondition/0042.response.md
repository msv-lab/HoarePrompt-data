Postcondition: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, and if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.**
