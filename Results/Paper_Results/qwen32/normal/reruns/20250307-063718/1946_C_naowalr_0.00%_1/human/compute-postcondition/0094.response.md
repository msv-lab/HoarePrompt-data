The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the sublist at index `a`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `z` which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t`, `i` remain unchanged, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
