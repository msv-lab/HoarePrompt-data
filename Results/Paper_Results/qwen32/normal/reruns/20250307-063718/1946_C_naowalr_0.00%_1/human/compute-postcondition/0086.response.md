Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `x` and `R` is updated to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is `L + 2`.**
