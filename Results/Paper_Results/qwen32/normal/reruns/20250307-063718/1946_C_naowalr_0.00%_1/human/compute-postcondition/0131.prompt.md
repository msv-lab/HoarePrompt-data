Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` are as described in the precondition, with `x` being 50001. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `x` are defined as follows: If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 25001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 25001. Otherwise, `L` is 50001, `R` is `x`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50002 if `x` was 25001 and `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `L` remains 50001 if `x` was 25001, otherwise `L` remains 1; `R` is 25001; `numCuts` remains 0; `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`; `x` remains 25001.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
