Postcondition: **`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, and `adj` are as described in the precondition, with `x` being 50001. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.**
