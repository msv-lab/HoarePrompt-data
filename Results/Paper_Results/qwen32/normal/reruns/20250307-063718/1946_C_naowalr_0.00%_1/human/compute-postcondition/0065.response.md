Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2, which results in 50001. All other variables retain their initial state values.
