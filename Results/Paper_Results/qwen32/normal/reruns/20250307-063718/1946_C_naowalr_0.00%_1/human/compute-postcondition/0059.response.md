Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, b, a]`, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and `numCuts` is 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `adj[b]` has been updated to include `a` at the end, making it `[a, b, a]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
