Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**

In simple terms, the list `adj` at index `a` now contains the integer `b`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
