The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that if `a` was not already in `adj[b]`, it will now be included, ensuring that the edge between `a` and `b` is represented bidirectionally in the adjacency list.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the adjacency list `adj`. Specifically, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains the integer `b` and now `adj[b]` also contains the integer `a`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is 2, and `adj[a]` includes `b`. Additionally, `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**
