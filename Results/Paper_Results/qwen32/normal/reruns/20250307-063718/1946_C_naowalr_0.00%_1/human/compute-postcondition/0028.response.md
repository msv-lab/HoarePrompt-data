Postcondition: **`n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `k` remains the number of edges to be removed, `adj` remains the adjacency list, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is still a loop variable, `i` is still `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain updated, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. In this latter case, `R` is set to 50001.**
