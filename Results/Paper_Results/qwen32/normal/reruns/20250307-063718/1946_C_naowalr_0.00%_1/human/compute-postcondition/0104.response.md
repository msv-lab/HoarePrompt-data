Output State: **`L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`, `numCuts` and `leftover` will be the values determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2, `k` will be the values read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` is `z + (n - 1)`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist at index `a` includes all `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b` as read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations:
- `L` and `R` still satisfy `R = L + 1`.
- `numCuts` and `leftover` retain their values from the last iteration.
- `n` and `k` remain as they were initially read from the input.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` will have incremented to `n - 1` (the last value it takes in the loop).
- `z` will have increased by `n - 1` (one increment per loop iteration).
- `adj` will be a list of `n + 1` lists, where each sublist at index `a` contains all indices `b` that are connected to `a` according to the edges read from the input.
