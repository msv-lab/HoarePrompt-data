The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so there is no need to adjust it before the loop begins.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment**
