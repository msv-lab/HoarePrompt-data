Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency of vertices, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is a loop variable, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` have been updated for all edges read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2, which results in 50001. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
