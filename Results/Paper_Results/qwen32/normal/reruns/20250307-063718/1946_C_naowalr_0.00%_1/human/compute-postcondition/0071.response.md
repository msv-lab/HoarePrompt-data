The value of `R` is updated to the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is `x`, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
