The code snippet provided reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the input values.

The other variables (`adj`, `t`, `z`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.

Given the nature of the input, `n` will now hold the integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` will hold the integer representing the number of edges to be removed, with the constraints `1 <= k < n` still applying.

Output State: **`n` is the number of vertices in the tree as read from input, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as read from input, `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `z` is the loop variable and does not need adjustment.**
