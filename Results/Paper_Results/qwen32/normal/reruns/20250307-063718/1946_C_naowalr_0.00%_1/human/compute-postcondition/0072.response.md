Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to `x` and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to `x`. `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)` in both cases.**
