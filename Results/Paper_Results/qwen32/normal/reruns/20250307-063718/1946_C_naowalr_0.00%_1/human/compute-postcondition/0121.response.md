The code snippet sets `L` to the value of `x`. According to the initial state, `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`; otherwise, `x` is 25001 with `L` and `R` reset to 1 and 50001, respectively. Since `numCuts` is 0 and there is no information given about `k` or `leftover`, we assume the default case where `x` is 25001. Therefore, `L` will be set to 25001.

Output State: **`L` is 25001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 25001.**
