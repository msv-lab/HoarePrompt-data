Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is -1, `adj` is a new adjacency list with `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists corresponding to the nodes that have been connected, which now contain the correct adjacency lists representing the edges read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `numCuts` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to 100001. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
