To determine the Output State after the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to focus on the impact of the line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)`. Since the function `dfs` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that `leftover` will be assigned the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.

Given that the initial values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `x` are specified, and the other variables (`leftover`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `z`, `adj`) are described as part of the precondition, we can assume that the execution of `dfs(1, 1)` will not affect `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, or `x` unless `dfs` modifies these variables, which is not indicated. Therefore, we will consider `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` to remain unchanged.

The variable `leftover` will be updated to the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, but without the definition of `dfs`, we cannot determine the specific value of `leftover`. We will denote it as `dfs(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 75001 if `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, otherwise `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**

In simpler terms, the value of `leftover` is now set to whatever value is returned by the function `dfs(1, 1)`, while all other variables retain their initial values unless `dfs` modifies them, which is not indicated.
