The provided code snippet only sets the recursion limit for the Python interpreter using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not directly affect any variables or the input/output of the function `func`. It merely adjusts the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to prevent hitting the recursion limit in deep recursive functions.

Since there are no variables being modified or values being computed in the given code snippet, and no return statement or other operations that would change the state of the program, the only change is the increased recursion limit.

Output State: **The recursion limit is set to 1000000; the function `func` takes no input parameters directly, but it is expected to read from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) and m (the number of vertices and edges, respectively). The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and no loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
