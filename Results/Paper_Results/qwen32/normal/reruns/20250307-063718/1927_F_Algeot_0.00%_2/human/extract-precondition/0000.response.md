Precondition: **The function `func` takes no input parameters directly, but it is expected to read from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) and m (the number of vertices and edges, respectively). The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and no loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
