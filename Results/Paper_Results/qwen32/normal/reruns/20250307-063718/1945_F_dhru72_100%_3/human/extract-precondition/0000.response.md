Precondition: **Each test case consists of three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of mushrooms, a list v of size n (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
