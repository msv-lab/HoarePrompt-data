### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Breakdown

1. **Constructing `r`:**
   - `r` is the string of all distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - For example, for `s = "codeforces"`, `r` would be `"cdefors"`.

2. **Encoding Process:**
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
   - The first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.
   - For example, `s = "codeforces"` becomes `"serofedsoc"` after encoding.

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - The task is to reverse the encoding process to get back the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.
   - This involves creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character and then applying this mapping to each character in `b`.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program constructs `r` by taking the set of characters in `b` (to ensure all characters are distinct), sorting them, and joining them into a string.
   - This matches the problem description.

3. **Creating the Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Specifically, `mapping[r[i]] = r[-(i + 1)]` ensures that each character is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
   - This matches the problem description.

4. **Decoding the String:**
   - The program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `mapping`.
   - This correctly reverses the encoding process.

#### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Example Input:**
  ```
  5
  10
  serofedsoc
  3
  ttf
  9
  tlrhgmaoi
  1
  w
  15
  hnndledmnhlttin
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  codeforces
  fft
  algorithm
  w
  meetinthemiddle
  ```

Running the program with the example input produces the expected output, confirming that the program correctly decodes the encoded strings.

#### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary provided states:
- The function takes a string `b` as input.
- It constructs `r` as the sorted set of unique characters from `b`.
- It creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
- It applies this mapping to each character in `b` to produce the decoded string.

This summary aligns with the problem description and the implementation in the code.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`, and the program produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
