Correctness: **False**

The provided program is actually performing the encoding operation described in the problem statement, not the decoding. To decode the string, you need to reverse the mapping process. Specifically, each character in the encoded string should be replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed alphabetical order of distinct characters from the encoded string.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function to perform the decoding:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[-(i + 1)]: r[i] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings as required by the problem statement.
