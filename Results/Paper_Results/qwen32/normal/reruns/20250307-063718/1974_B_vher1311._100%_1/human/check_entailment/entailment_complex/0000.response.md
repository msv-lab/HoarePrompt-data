### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to decode an encoded string back to its original form. The decoding process involves constructing a mapping from the encoded string's unique characters to their corresponding original characters based on the described encoding algorithm.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - It first constructs the string `r`, which contains all unique characters of `b` sorted in alphabetical order.
   - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second maps to the second last, and so on).
   - Using this mapping, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value and returns the decoded string.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.

### Verification:
- The program correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string `b` and sorts them.
- The mapping dictionary `mapping` correctly pairs each character in `r` with its symmetric counterpart.
- The decoded string is accurately formed by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as per the problem description. Given the input-output pairs in the example, the program produces the expected results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
