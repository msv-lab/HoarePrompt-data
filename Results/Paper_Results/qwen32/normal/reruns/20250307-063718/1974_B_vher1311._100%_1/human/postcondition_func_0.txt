The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains an integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a single string formed by mapping each character in the input strings to a new character based on a specific mapping rule. The mapping rule is derived from the unique characters in the input strings, where each character is mapped to another character in reverse order of their sorted unique appearance.
