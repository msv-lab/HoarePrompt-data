#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by mapping each character in each string `b` in `encoded` using `mapping`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains an integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a single string formed by mapping each character in the input strings to a new character based on a specific mapping rule. The mapping rule is derived from the unique characters in the input strings, where each character is mapped to another character in reverse order of their sorted unique appearance.
