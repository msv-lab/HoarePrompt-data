The code snippet creates a dictionary called `mapping` where each character in the string `r` is mapped to a character from the end of `r` in reverse order. Specifically, the character at index `i` in `r` is mapped to the character at index `-(i + 1)` in `r`.

Given the initial state, `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order. The length of `r` determines how many mappings will be created.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`; `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order; `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `r` in reverse order.**

In simpler terms, the output state includes the original `encoded` list and `r` string, with the addition of the `mapping` dictionary that pairs each character in `r` with its corresponding character from the end of `r` in reverse order.
