Reasoning:
The given program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` which contains all the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Each character in the encoded string `b` is then replaced by its symmetric character from `r`. The decoding process reverses this by mapping each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in `s` using the same auxiliary string `r`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it matches the problem description:

1. The program reads the input and splits it into test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that performs the decoding:
   - `r` is created by sorting the unique characters of `b`.
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second-last, and so on).
   - The encoded string `b` is decoded by replacing each character with its mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.
4. The decoded strings are collected and printed.

The execution summary confirms that the function processes each test case by creating the auxiliary string `r`, establishing the mapping, and then decoding the string `b` based on this mapping.

Given that the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement, it will produce the correct output for the given examples and any valid input within the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
