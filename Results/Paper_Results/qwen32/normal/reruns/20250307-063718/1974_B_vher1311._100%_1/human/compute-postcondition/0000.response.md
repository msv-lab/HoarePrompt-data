The code snippet provided takes the list of tuples `encoded`, extracts the strings from each tuple, combines them into a single set to remove duplicates, sorts the unique characters, and then joins them into a single string `r`. 

Initial State: `encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`; `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order.**

In simpler terms, `r` will be a string of unique, sorted characters from all the strings contained within the tuples of the `encoded` list.
