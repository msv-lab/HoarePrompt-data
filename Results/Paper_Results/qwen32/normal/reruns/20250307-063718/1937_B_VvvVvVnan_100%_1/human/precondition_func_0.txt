Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the grid, followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid respectively. The function will be called with multiple test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
