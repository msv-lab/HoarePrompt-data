Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`.** 

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the adjacency list `adj` will have been fully populated with `n - 1` edges, connecting `n` nodes as specified by the input pairs `(a, b)`. The variable `i` will have decremented to `-1` since the loop runs from `i = n - 2` to `i = 0`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover`) will remain in their states as described in the initial conditions.
