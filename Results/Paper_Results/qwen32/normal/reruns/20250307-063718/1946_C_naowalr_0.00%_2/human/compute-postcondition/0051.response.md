The code snippet appends the value `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. This changes the content of `adj[b]` by adding `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now contains `b`, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**
