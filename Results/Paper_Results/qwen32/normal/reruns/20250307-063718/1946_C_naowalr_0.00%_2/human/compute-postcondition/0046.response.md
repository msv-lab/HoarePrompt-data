The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `adj`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + 1` (incremented by 1 from the previous iteration); `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
