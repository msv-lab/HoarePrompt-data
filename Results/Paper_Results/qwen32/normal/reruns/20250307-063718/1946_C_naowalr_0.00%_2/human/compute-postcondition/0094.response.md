The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at index `a` in `adj` will now include `b` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `adj`, specifically the list at index `a` within `adj`. All other variables retain their original values and states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now includes `b`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
