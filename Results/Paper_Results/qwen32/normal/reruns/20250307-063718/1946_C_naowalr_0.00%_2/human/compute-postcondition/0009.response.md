The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are already assigned the first and second integers from the input, respectively. Therefore, executing the given code will overwrite the values of `a` and `b` with the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now includes `a` (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input.**
