Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a` (as per the input pairs), `i` is `n - 2` (since the loop runs from 0 to `n - 2`), no new `a` or `b` are read as the loop has finished, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is updated by `dfs`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` and `R` are updated by `dfs`, `numCuts` is updated by `dfs`, `x` is updated by `dfs`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the program proceeds accordingly. Otherwise, `L` is set to `x`, `R` is updated by `dfs`, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is updated by `dfs`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` and `R` are updated by `dfs` such that `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), `R` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is updated by `dfs`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` and `R` are updated by `dfs` such that `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
