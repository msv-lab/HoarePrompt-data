The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` includes `a` twice (in addition to any previous elements), the list at index `a` in `adj` now includes `b` as an additional element, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input.**
