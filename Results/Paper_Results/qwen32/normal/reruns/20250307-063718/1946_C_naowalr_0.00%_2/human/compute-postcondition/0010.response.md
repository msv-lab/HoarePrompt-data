The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list at index `a` of the `adj` list by appending the value `b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values and constraints.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` includes `a` (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` now includes `b`.**
