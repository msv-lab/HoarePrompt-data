Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` remains `(L + R) // 2` and `R` remains the same. Otherwise, `L` is updated to `L - 1` and `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. `x` is recalculated as `(L + R) // 2` in both cases.**
