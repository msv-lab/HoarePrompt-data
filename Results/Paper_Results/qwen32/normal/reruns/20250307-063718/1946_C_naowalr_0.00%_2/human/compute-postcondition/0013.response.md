The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the other variables directly but updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, and `i` is 2. These conditions remain unchanged after the execution of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` includes `a` twice (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` now includes `b`.**
