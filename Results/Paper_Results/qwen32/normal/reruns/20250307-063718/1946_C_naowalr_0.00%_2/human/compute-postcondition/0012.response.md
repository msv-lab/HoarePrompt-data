The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n - 1` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` includes `a` twice (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` now includes `b`.**
