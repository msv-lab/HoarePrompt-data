The code `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the list at index `a`. This means that the relationship between `a` and `b` is updated in the adjacency list, indicating that `b` is now connected to `a`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `i` is `n - 1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` includes `b`.**
