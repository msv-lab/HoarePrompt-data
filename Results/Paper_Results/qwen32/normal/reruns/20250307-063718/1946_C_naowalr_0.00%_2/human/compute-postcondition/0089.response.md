The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `z` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` was incremented by `n - 1`, so we need to adjust `z` to its new value at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `z` was `z + n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `z` will be incremented by `n - 1` again. Therefore, the new value of `z` will be `z + n - 1 + n - 1`, but since we are at the start of the next iteration, we just need to set `z` to `z + n - 1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`.**
