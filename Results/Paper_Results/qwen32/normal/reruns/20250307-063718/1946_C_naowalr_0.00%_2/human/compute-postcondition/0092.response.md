The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `n - 1`. To ensure that the loop executes, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is `n - 2`, but this value does not affect whether the loop will execute; it only affects the first iteration. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1, ensuring that the range `n - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`**
