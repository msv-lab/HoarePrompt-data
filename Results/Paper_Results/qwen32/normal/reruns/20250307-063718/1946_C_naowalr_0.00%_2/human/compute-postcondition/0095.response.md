The code snippet provided is:
```python
adj[b].append(a)
```

This line of code modifies the list `adj` by appending the value of `a` to the list at index `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The list `adj` at index `b` now includes the value `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
