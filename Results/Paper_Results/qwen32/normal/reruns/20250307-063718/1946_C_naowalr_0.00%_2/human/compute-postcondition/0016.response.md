Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a` (as per the input pairs), `i` is `n - 2` (since the loop runs from 0 to `n - 2`), no new `a` or `b` are read as the loop has finished.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will fully represent the connections between nodes as specified by the input pairs. The loop variable `i` will have reached its final value of `n - 2`. The variables `n`, `k`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
