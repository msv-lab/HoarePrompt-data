Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, processing `t` different trees. For each tree, `n` and `k` are read from the input, `adj` is constructed as an adjacency list representing the tree, and a binary search is performed to determine the maximum number of vertices that can remain connected after removing exactly `k` edges. The final value of `L` (which equals `R` after convergence) is printed for each tree.**

In simpler terms: After all iterations, the loop has processed `t` trees. For each tree, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (number of edges to remove), constructs an adjacency list `adj` for the tree, and performs a binary search to find the maximum number of vertices that can remain connected after removing exactly `k` edges. The final value of `L` (which equals `R` after the binary search converges) is printed for each tree.
