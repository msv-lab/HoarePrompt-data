The only variable in the loop head is `z` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `z` is initialized to 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
