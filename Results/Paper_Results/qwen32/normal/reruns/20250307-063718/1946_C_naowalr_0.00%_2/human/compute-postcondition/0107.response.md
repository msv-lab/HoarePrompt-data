The provided code snippet simply resets the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other conditions and variable values as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to 1; `R` is equal to 100001.**
