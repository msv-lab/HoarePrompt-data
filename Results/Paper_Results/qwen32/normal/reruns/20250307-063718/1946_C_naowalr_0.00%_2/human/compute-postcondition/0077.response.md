Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 2; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 2; `R` is 3; `numCuts` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to 2, as per the assignment `L = x`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
