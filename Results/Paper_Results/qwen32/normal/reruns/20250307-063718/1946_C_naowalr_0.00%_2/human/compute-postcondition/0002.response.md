The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the input values. The variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, while `t` and `z` retain their original values.
