Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `t` is an integer read from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than or equal to 2, k is the second integer from the input, t is greater than 0, z is updated by dfs, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where each list at index a includes all the nodes b that are connected to a, i is n - 2, L and R have converged such that R - L is not greater than 1, numCuts is 0, x is the last value calculated as (L + R) // 2, and leftover is the value returned by dfs(1, 1) in the final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: L is equal to R, and x is the final midpoint value after the binary search converges.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
