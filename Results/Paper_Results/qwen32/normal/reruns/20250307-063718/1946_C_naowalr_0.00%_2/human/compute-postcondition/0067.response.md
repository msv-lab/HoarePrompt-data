Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 1; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The only change in the state is the reassignment of the variable `leftover` to the value returned by the function call `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
