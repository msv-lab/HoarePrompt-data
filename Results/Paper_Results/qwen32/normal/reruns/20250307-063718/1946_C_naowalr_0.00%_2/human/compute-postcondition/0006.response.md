The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. Therefore, the list at index `a` in `adj` will now include `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b`, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
