Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is updated by `dfs`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` and `R` are updated by `dfs` such that `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`.**

Natural Language: The value of `numCuts` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
