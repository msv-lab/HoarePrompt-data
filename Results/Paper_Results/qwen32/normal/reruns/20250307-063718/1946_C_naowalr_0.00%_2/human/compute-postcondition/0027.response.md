The code snippet `R = x` updates the variable `R` to have the same value as `x`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is updated by `dfs`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is updated by `dfs`, `R` is `x`, `numCuts` is updated by `dfs`, `x` is updated by `dfs`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`. Additionally, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
