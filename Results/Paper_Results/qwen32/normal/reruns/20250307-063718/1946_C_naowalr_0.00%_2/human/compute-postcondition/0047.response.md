The given code snippet reinitializes the `adj` variable to be a list of `n + 1` empty lists. This means that any previous connections stored in `adj` are lost, and `adj` is reset to its initial state of having `n + 1` empty lists.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + 1` (incremented by 1 from the previous iteration); `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
