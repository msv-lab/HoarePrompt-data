Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to 1; `R` is equal to 100001.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is equal to 50001 and `R` is equal to 100001. Otherwise, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`, with `L` equal to 1 and `R` equal to 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` remains `(L + R) // 2` and `R` remains the same. Otherwise, `L` is updated to `L - 1` and `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. `x` is recalculated as `(L + R) // 2` in both cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R` must be at least `L + 2` to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
