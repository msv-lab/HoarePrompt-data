Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed when the `print(L)` statement is executed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is calculated as `z + n - 1`.
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`.
   - `i` is set to `n - 2`.
   - `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1.
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration.
   - `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.
   - `L` is equal to `R`.

2. **Specific focus on `L`:**
   - The problem states that `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1.
   - Additionally, `L` is explicitly stated to be equal to `R`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `L` is equal to `R` and `R - L` is not greater than 1, the only value that satisfies both conditions is when `L` and `R` are the same. Therefore, the value of `L` is the final midpoint `x` calculated in the last iteration.

### Final Output:
The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`, which is the final midpoint `x` calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration.

Output: **L (where L is the final midpoint x calculated as (L + R) // 2 in the last iteration)**

However, since `L` is equal to `R` and `R - L` is not greater than 1, `L` is simply the value of `x`.

Output: **x (where x is the final midpoint calculated as (L + R) // 2 in the last iteration)**
