Given the initial state:
- `L` is equal to `R`.
- `x` is the final midpoint value after the binary search converges.

The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`. Since `L` is equal to `R` and `x` is the final midpoint value after the binary search converges, the value of `L` (and `R`) will be the same as the final midpoint value `x` after the binary search has completed.

Therefore, the print statement will output the final midpoint value `x` of the binary search.

Output: **x (where x is the final midpoint value after the binary search converges)**
