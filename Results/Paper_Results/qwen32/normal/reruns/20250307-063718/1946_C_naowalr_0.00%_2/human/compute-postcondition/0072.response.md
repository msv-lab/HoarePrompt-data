Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 1; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `R` is 1; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x` in the if part, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` less than `x` in the else part.**
