The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be less than `n - 1`. However, since `i` is currently `n - 1`, the loop will not execute again in its current state.

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` includes `b`.**
