The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state except for `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `k` is an integer
- `t` is greater than 0
- `z` is `z + 1`
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and `b` contains `a` (with `a` appearing twice)
- `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1
- `numCuts` is 0
- `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`
- `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input
- `adj[b]` includes `a` twice

After the code snippet is executed, `a` and `b` will be updated with the new values read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and `b` contains `a` (with `a` appearing twice), `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` includes `a` twice**.
