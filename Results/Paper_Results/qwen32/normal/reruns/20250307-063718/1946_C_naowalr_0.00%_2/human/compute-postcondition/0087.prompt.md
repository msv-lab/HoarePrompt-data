Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 1; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `R` is 1; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x` in the if part, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` less than `x` in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 2; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 2. Otherwise, `L` is 1. `R` remains 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 2; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 2 and `R` remains 3. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
