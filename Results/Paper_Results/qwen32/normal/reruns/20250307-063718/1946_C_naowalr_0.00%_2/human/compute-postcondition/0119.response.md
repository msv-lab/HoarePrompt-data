The given Python code snippet initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `numCuts` is now 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `L` is `L - 1`, `R` is the same, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0.**
