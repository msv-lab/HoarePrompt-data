The code snippet appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the list at index `a` in the `adj` list will now contain `b` in addition to its previous elements, which are `b` and `a` (with `a` appearing twice).

Given the initial state, `adj[a]` originally contains `[b, a, a]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` will be `[b, a, a, b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `[b, a, a, b]` and the list at index `b` contains `a` twice, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` includes `a` twice**.
