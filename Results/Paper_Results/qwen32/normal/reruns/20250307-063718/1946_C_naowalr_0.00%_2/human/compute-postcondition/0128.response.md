Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R` must be at least `L + 2` to ensure `R - L > 1`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Natural language description: The value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
