Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input, `i` is `-1`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R` must be at least `L + 2` to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.**
