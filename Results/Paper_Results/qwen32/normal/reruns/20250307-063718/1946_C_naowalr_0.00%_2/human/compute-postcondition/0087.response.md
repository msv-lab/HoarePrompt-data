Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop has narrowed down the range `[L, R]` to a single value, meaning `L` equals `R`. The variable `x` holds the final midpoint value from the last iteration, and `leftover` contains the result from the `dfs` function call in that final iteration. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions or as they are not affected by the loop.
