Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 1; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is recalculated as `(L + R) // 2`, which results in `(1 + 100001) // 2 = 50001`. However, since `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, and `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the condition for convergence is not met in the context of the provided state. Therefore, the provided state already indicates that `x` was calculated as `1` in a previous iteration, and this value is maintained in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged.
