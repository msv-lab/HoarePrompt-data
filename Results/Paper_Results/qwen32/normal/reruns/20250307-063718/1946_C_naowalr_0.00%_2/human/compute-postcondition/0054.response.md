The provided code snippet appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list. This means that the list `adj[a]` will now include `b` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `adj[a]`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` now contains `b` in addition to its previous elements, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` includes `a`.**
