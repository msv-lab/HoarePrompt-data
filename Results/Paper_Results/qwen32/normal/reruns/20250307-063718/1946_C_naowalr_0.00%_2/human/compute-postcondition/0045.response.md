The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is updated by `dfs`, but for the loop to continue, `z` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1` (incremented by 1 from the previous iteration), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a`, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.**
