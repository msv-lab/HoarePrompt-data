Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to 1; `R` is equal to 100001`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `R` has been updated to 100001, while all other variables retain their initial values or states.
