The code appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. This changes the list at index `b` in `adj` by adding `a` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now includes `a` (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
