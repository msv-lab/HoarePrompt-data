The code creates a list of empty lists, where the number of sublists is `n + 1`. This means the variable `adj` is now a list containing `n + 1` empty lists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `z` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists**.
