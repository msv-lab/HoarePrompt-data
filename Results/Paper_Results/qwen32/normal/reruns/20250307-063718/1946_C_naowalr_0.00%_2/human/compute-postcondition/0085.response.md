Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `x` is 2; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is 2. Otherwise, `L` is 1. `R` is 2. L must be 1.**

Explanation: The value of `R` is updated to the value of `x`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
