Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a` (as per the input pairs), `i` is `n - 2` (since the loop runs from 0 to `n - 2`), no new `a` or `b` are read as the loop has finished, `L` is 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `L` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
