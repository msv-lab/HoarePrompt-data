The given code snippet appends `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. This affects the `adj` list directly, but no other variables are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` now includes `a`; `i` is `n - 2`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the final midpoint calculated as `(L + R) // 2` in the last iteration; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `L` is equal to `R`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The list at index `a` in `adj` includes `b`, and the list at index `b` in `adj` includes `a`.**

In simpler terms, the list `adj[b]` now includes the value `a`, and no other variables have changed.
