The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Since `i` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it defines the total number of iterations the loop should run, which is `n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now includes `a` (in addition to any previous elements), `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input**
