The code snippet provided appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list of lists. Given the initial state, the value of `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, the list at index `a` will no longer be empty but will contain the integer `b`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**

In natural language, after the code is executed, the list at index `a` in the `adj` list now contains the integer `b`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
