The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now contains `b`, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**
