Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the two integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is `z + n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a` for all `n - 1` pairs `(a, b)` read from the input; `i` is `-1`; `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `L` is equal to 50001; `R` is equal to 100001.**

The variable `L` has been updated to the value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.
