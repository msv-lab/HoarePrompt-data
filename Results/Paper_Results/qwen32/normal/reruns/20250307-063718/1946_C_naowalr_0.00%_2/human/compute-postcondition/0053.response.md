The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables except for `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is `z + 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `b` now contains `b`, `L` and `R` have converged such that `R - L` is not greater than 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last value calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**
