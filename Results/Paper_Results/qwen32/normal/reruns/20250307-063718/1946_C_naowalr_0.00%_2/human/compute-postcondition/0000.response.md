The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `t` is an integer read from standard input.**
