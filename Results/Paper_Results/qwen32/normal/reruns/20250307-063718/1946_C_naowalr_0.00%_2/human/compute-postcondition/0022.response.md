Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all the nodes `b` that are connected to `a` (as per the input pairs), `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

The value of `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0, but all other variables retain their initial values.
