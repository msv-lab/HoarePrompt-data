To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `high >= cur`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p1`.
- `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.
- `cur` is either `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1`.

The loop condition `high >= cur` must be true for the loop to execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is either `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `cur` is decremented or `high` is incremented such that `high` remains greater than or equal to `cur`.

However, based on the problem statement, `cur` is only incremented by 1 in the loop body, and there is no indication that `high` is modified within the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cur` is decremented by 1, or `high` is at least `cur + 1`.

Since `cur` can only be adjusted based on the given conditions, we need to ensure that `cur` is decremented by 1 (if possible) to satisfy the loop condition. If `cur` is already `p3 - p2`, then we need to make sure `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`; `cur` is `p3 - p2`**.

This ensures that `high` is at least `cur + 1`, and thus the loop condition `high >= cur` will be true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
