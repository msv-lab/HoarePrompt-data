The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output will solely depend on the `print(-1)` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
2. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers between 0 and 30, inclusive, and satisfy the condition `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3`.
3. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, and their sum is odd.
4. The `print(-1)` statement is executed, which outputs the integer `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state, the output is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
