The code assigns the value of `low` to the variable `cur`. The value of `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`.**
