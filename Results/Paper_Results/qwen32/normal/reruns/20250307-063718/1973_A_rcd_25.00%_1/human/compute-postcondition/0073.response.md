To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` as they are the ones mentioned in the loop condition `high >= cur`.

Given the state information:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is either `low` if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, or `low + 1` if `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

For the loop to continue executing, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. If at the end of the previous iteration `high` is less than `cur`, we need to adjust `cur` or `high` to ensure the condition holds.

Let's break it down:
1. **If `high >= cur` holds**: No adjustments are needed as the loop can execute one more time.
2. **If `high < cur` holds**: We need to adjust `cur` to be less than or equal to `high`.

Since we can only adjust `high` and `cur`, and `high` is derived from `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the easiest way to ensure the loop continues is to adjust `cur` to be less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `high`**.

Since we need to ensure `high >= cur`, we can simply state that `cur` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `high` if it is not already.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `high`**.

To make it more explicit:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is less than or equal to `high`**.
