To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)`, let's break down the given initial state and the relationships between the variables.

1. **Variables and their properties:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is defined as `p3 - p1`.
   - `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.
   - `cur` is defined as `p3 - p2`.

2. **Expression to evaluate:**
   - We need to evaluate `p1 - cur + p3`.

3. **Substitute `cur` with its definition:**
   - `cur` is `p3 - p2`.
   - So, the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3`.

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   - `p1 - p3 + p2 + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p2`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p2`.

Given the initial conditions and the simplification, the output of the print statement is the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2**
