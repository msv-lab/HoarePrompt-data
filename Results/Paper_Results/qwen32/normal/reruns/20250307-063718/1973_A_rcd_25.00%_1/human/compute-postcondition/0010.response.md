The code calculates the `low` and `high` values based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`. Given the constraints, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The `low` variable is assigned the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and the `high` variable is assigned the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Since `p3` is less than both `p1 + p2` and individually less than `p1` and `p2` (because `p1 <= p2 <= p3`), both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are non-positive. However, since `p3` is less than `p1` and `p2`, the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are negative, and `p3 - p1` is more negative than `p3 - p2` because `p1 <= p2`.

Thus, `low` will be `p3 - p1` and `high` will be `p3 - p2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is `p3 - p2`.**
