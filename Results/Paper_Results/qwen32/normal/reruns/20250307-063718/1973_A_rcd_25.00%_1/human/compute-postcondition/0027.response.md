The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` is initially `p3 - p2`. After the increment, `cur` becomes `(p3 - p2) + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`; `cur` is `p3 - p2 + 1`.**
