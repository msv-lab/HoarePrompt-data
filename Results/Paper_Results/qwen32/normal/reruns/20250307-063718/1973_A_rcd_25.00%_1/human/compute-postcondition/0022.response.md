Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`; `cur` is `p3 - p2 + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `p3 - p2 + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
