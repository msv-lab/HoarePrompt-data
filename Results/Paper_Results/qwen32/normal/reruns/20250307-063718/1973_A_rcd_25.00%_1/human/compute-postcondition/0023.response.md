Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`; `cur` is either `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
