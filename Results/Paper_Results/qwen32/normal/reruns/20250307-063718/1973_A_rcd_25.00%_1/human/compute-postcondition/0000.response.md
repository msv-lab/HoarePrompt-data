The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). After executing this line, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer value is provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).

The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`) are not affected by this line of code, so their conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.**
