The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state provides constraints on the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and conditions related to their sums and comparisons. The code snippet itself does not change the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, or `p_3`; it only assigns new values to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, the loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now assigned the values read from the input. The conditions and constraints on `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.
