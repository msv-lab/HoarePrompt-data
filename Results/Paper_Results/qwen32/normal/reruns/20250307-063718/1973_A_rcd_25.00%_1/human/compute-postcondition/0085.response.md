To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop for each iteration and how the variables change or remain constant.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each iteration, the following steps occur:

1. The loop reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input.
2. It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and moves to the next iteration.
3. If the sum is even, it checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition holds, it prints `p1 + p2`.
4. If the condition does not hold, it enters a while loop to find the correct value to print. It initializes `cur` to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and iterates while `cur` is less than or equal to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If it finds a value of `cur` such that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

Given that the output state after the first 3 iterations includes the conditions that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd for each iteration, we can infer that for each iteration, the loop prints `-1` and moves to the next iteration.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is always odd for each iteration, the loop will print `-1` exactly `t` times. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are re-read in each iteration and do not affect the final state of `t`.

Thus, after all `t` iterations, the only thing that changes is the number of times `-1` is printed, which is `t` times.

Output State: **The loop prints `-1` exactly `t` times.**
