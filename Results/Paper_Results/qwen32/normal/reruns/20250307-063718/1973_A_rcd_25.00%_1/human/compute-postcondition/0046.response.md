To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must hold true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `high` and `cur` such that `high >= cur`.

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is a fixed value based on the input values `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The value of `cur` is determined based on the condition involving `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cur` is less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` can either be `low` or `low + 1`, we need to ensure that `low + 1` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `low + 1 <= high`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is such that `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` and `low + 1 <= high`**
