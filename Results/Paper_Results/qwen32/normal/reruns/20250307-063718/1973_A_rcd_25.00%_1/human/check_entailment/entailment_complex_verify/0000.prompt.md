You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)

                else:
                    cur += 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

    #State: The loop prints `-1` exactly `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30). For each test case, it prints a value based on the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and their relationships. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value that can be achieved under the given constraints.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The program aims to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and the program needs to handle multiple test cases.

Here's the program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Check if the total points are even**: The total points from all games must be even because each game awards an even number of points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for a draw each). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the function returns `-1`.

2. **Calculate the maximum possible draws**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score player could have drawn with both other players, and the remaining points can be distributed as wins and losses.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates a range of possible draws and iterates through it to find a valid configuration. The logic here seems to be checking if the scores can be achieved by a certain number of draws and wins/losses.

Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases:

- **Case 1**: `0 0 0` - No games were played, so no draws could occur. The program correctly returns `0`.
- **Case 2**: `0 1 1` - One draw between the second and third player. The program correctly returns `1`.
- **Case 3**: `1 1 1` - This is impossible because if there's one draw, the scores would be `1 1 1` (if one player draws with another and loses to the third), but if there are no draws, the scores would be `0 2 0` or permutations thereof. The program correctly returns `-1`.
- **Case 4**: `1 1 2` - Two draws between the highest score player and the others. The program correctly returns `2`.
- **Case 5**: `3 3 3` - This is impossible because the maximum points a player can get from draws is `2` (if they draw with both other players). The program correctly returns `-1`.
- **Case 6**: `3 4 5` - The program correctly returns `6` after calculating the possible draws.
- **Case 7**: `1 1 10` - This is impossible because the maximum points a player can get from draws and wins is `6` (if they draw with both other players and win one game against one of them). The program correctly returns `2`.

The program seems to handle all provided examples correctly. Let's check for any potential edge cases that might not be covered:

- **Case 8**: `0 0 2` - This is impossible because the only way to get 2 points is from a win, and that would require at least one other player to have points. The program correctly returns `-1`.

- **Case 9**: `0 2 2` - This is possible if one player wins against another and draws with the third. The program correctly returns `1`.

- **Case 10**: `1 2 3` - This is possible if one player wins against another and draws with the third, and another player wins against the third. The program correctly returns `1`.

After analyzing various cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, and it correctly handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.
