Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves three players and their scores after playing a series of chess games. Each game results in either a win (2 points to the winner) or a draw (1 point to each player). The scores are given in non-decreasing order, and we need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, or if the scores are not possible given the rules.

### Key Points

1. **Total Points**: The total points among the three players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw) to the total.
2. **Score Constraints**: The scores must be achievable through a combination of wins and draws. Specifically:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score can be achieved by drawing with both other players.
   - Otherwise, we need to find a combination of wins and draws that satisfies the scores.

### Program Analysis

The program follows a structured approach to solve the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Total Points Check**: It first checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent.
3. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible range of draws and iterates to find a valid combination of wins and draws that satisfies the scores.

### Detailed Steps for the Program

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - This is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores with the given rules.

2. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the highest score can be achieved by drawing with both other players, so the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible range of draws (`low` and `high`) and iterates to find a valid combination:
     - `low` is the minimum number of draws needed to reach `p3` from `p1` or `p2`.
     - `high` is the maximum number of draws needed to reach `p3` from `p1` or `p2`.
     - It then checks if the remaining points can be distributed as wins between the other two players.

### Validation with Examples

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `0`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `0`.

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `1`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `1`.

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, odd. It prints `-1`.

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `1`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `2`.

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, odd. It prints `-1`.

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `2`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `6`.

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `9`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the cases and constraints as per the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
