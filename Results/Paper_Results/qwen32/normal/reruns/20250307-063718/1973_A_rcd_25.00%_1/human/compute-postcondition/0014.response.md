To determine the output of the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and constraints:

1. **Variables and Constraints:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500 (though `t` is not used in the given snippet).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1`.
   - `high` is `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is `p3 - p2`.
   - `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Derived Values:**
   - `cur` is set to `p3 - p2`.
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - Substitute `cur` with `p3 - p2` in the expression `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - This becomes `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3`.
   - Simplify the expression: `p1 - p3 + p2 + p3`.
   - The `p3` terms cancel out, resulting in `p1 + p2`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given the constraints and the simplification, the output of the print statement is the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2**
