To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`, so we need to ensure that this condition holds true after the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p1`.
- `high` is `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the program breaks out of the loop with `cur` as `p3 - p2`. Otherwise, `cur` is `p3 - p2 + 1`.

Let's analyze the loop condition:
- `high` is `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` can be either `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1` depending on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `high >= cur` must be true. If `cur` was `p3 - p2` and the loop did not break, `cur` would be incremented to `p3 - p2 + 1` in the next iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need `high` to be at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`; `cur` is `p3 - p2`**
