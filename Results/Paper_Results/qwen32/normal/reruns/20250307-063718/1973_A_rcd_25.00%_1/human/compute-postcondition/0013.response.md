Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `p3 - p2`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where `p_1` is less than or equal to `p_2` which is less than or equal to `p_3`, all within the range of 0 to 30. The integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the difference between `p3` and `p1`, and `high` is the difference between `p3` and `p2`. `cur` is equal to `p3 - p2`. Additionally, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.**
