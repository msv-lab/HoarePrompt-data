Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `p3 - p2`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
