To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

Given the state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `high >= cur`. Since `cur` is initialized to `low`, this condition will be satisfied if `high` is at least as large as `low`.

Given the definitions of `low` and `high`:
- `low` = min(`p3 - p1`, `p3 - p2`)
- `high` = max(`p3 - p1`, `p3 - p2`)

By definition, `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, the condition `high >= cur` (where `cur` is `low`) will always hold true, and no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`**
