Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, the loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`. Since the condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition, the else part is never executed.**
