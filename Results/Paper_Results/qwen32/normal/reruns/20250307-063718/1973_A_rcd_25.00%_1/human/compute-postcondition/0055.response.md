Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `cur` is such that if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`; otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2` and `low + 1 <= high`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is either `low + 2` or `low + 3` and `low + 2 <= high`.**
