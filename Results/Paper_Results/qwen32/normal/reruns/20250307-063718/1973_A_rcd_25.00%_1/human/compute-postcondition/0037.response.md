The code snippet calculates the minimum and maximum values between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and assigns them to `low` and `high` respectively. Given the initial state, we know that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers with specific constraints and that `p3` is either greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2` or less than it.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, then `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` will both be non-negative.
2. If `p3 < p1 + p2`, then `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` will still be non-negative because `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.

Thus, `low` will be the smaller of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` will be the larger of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
