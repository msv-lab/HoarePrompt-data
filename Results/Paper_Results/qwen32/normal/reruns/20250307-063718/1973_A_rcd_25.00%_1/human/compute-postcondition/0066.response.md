To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `high >= cur` must be true. Since `cur` is initialized to `low`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` will always be greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, the loop condition `high >= cur` will always be true given the initializations provided.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the states of `high` and `cur` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`**
