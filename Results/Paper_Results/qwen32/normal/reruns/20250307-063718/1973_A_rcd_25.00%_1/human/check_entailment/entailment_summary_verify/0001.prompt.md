You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30). For each test case, it prints a value based on the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and their relationships. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value that can be achieved under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves three players and their scores after playing a series of chess games. Each game results in either a win (2 points to the winner) or a draw (1 point to each player). The scores are given in non-decreasing order, and we need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, or if the scores are not possible given the rules.

### Key Points

1. **Total Points**: The total points among the three players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw) to the total.
2. **Score Constraints**: The scores must be achievable through a combination of wins and draws. Specifically:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score can be achieved by drawing with both other players.
   - Otherwise, we need to find a combination of wins and draws that satisfies the scores.

### Program Analysis

The program follows a structured approach to solve the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Total Points Check**: It first checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent.
3. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible range of draws and iterates to find a valid combination of wins and draws that satisfies the scores.

### Detailed Steps for the Program

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - This is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores with the given rules.

2. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the highest score can be achieved by drawing with both other players, so the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible range of draws (`low` and `high`) and iterates to find a valid combination:
     - `low` is the minimum number of draws needed to reach `p3` from `p1` or `p2`.
     - `high` is the maximum number of draws needed to reach `p3` from `p1` or `p2`.
     - It then checks if the remaining points can be distributed as wins between the other two players.

### Validation with Examples

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `0`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `0`.

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `1`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `1`.

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, odd. It prints `-1`.

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `1`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `2`.

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, odd. It prints `-1`.

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `2`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `6`.

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, even. Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` as `9`. The loop condition is satisfied, and it prints `2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the cases and constraints as per the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
