To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

The program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three friends, given their final scores. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores (p1 + p2 + p3) is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed among the players (either 2-0 for a win/loss or 1-1 for a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores through a valid series of games, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Score Comparison**: 
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because in this scenario, the player with the highest score could have won all the games against the other two players, and the remaining points (`p1 + p2`) must have come from draws among the other two players.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.

3. **Complex Logic for p3 < p1 + p2**:
   - The program calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high`, checking if the remaining points after accounting for some draws among the other two players can be achieved through a valid set of games.
   - If a valid configuration is found, it prints the total number of draws.
   - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it prints `p3`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic for the case when `p3 < p1 + p2`. The loop and conditions inside the loop do not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The logic for adjusting the number of draws and checking the consistency of the scores is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

For instance, the program does not correctly handle cases where the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins, losses, and draws that do not fit the simple linear checks it performs.

Given this analysis, the program is not always correct and can produce incorrect results for certain valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
