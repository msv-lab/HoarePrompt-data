### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred among three players based on their final scores. Let's analyze the logic and state transitions to verify its correctness.

1. **Input Constraints Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, ensuring `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.

2. **Total Points Validation**:
   - The program first checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. This is because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win-lose scenario) or 2 points (in case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This part is correctly implemented.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could have been accumulated through draws and wins against `p1` and `p2`. If `p3` is at least the sum of the other two scores, it implies that `p3` could have won all games against `p1` and `p2` and possibly drawn with one of them, leading to a maximum of `p1 + p2` draws.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible differences (`low` and `high`) between `p3` and the other scores. It then iterates through possible draw counts `cur` from `low` to `high`. During each iteration, it checks if the remaining points for `p1` after accounting for draws can be achieved by wins against `p2` after accounting for draws. If a valid configuration is found, it prints the total number of draws and breaks the loop. If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it defaults to printing `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games are played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), leading to zero draws.
   - It correctly identifies impossible score configurations (e.g., `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 10`), printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and state transitions, the program appears to correctly implement the problem requirements and handle all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
