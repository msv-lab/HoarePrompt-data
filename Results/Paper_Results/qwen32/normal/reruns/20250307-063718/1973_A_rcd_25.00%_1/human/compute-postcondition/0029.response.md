To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop condition is `while high >= cur`. The loop increments `cur` by 1 in each iteration unless the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, in which case it breaks.

Let's analyze the loop's behavior:
1. The loop starts with `cur` initialized to `p3 - p1`.
2. In each iteration, `cur` is incremented by 1 until `high < cur` or the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
3. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied, the loop breaks, and the program prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
4. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means `high < cur` and the program prints `p3`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we need to determine the final state after all iterations.

### Key Observations:
- The loop terminates either by breaking when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met or by completing all iterations when `high < cur`.
- The final value of `cur` will be the point at which the loop breaks or the value of `cur` when `high < cur`.

To determine the final state:
- If the loop breaks, the final `cur` is the value that satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- If the loop completes all iterations, the final `cur` is `high + 1`.

Let's formalize this:
- If the loop breaks, the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the loop completes, the output is `p3`.

Since the problem specifies the output states after the first 3 iterations, and we need to determine the final state, we need to consider the possibility of the loop breaking at any point or completing all iterations.

### Final Output State:
Given the loop's behavior and the conditions specified, the final output state will be determined by whether the loop breaks or completes.

- If the loop breaks, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` where `cur` satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- If the loop completes, the output will be `p3`.

Since the problem doesn't specify a specific input that would cause the loop to break within the first 3 iterations, we consider the general case where the loop could complete all iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **p3**.

This means that if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the final output will be `p3`.
