To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 + p2)`, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499. This variable doesn't affect the output of `p1 + p2`, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. These are the constraints on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. These are the actual values that will be used in the calculation.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means that the sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is not divisible by 2.
5. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. This condition informs us about the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

The specific values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, but we know the constraints and the fact that their sum is odd. The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the value of `p1 + p2` is not further constrained by the given information and can vary based on the input values, we can't provide a specific numerical value. However, we know the sum will be an integer and that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30 and p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
