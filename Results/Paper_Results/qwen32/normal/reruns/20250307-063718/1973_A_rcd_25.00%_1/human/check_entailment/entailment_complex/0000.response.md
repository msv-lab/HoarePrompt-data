### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it accurately computes the maximum number of draws given the constraints.

1. **Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (each game results in a total of 2 points, either 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Draw Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws possible is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could be achieved by the player winning all games against the other two players, and the remaining points can only be from draws.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of draws (`cur`), checking if the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed between `p1` and `p2` in a valid way. If it finds a valid distribution, it prints the total number of draws plus the points contributed by the highest scoring player (`p3`).

3. **Logic Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the sum being odd by printing `-1`.
   - The logic for calculating draws in both cases seems consistent with the problem statement. The loop ensures that the program finds the maximum possible number of draws by checking all valid distributions of points between `p1` and `p2`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is consistent with the problem's constraints.

**Correctness: True**
