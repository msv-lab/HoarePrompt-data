Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
