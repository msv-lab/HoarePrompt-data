The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and their constraints, but it does not affect the value printed by the `print(-1)` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement is a direct output statement that prints the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
