The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers within certain ranges. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` or the initial `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. Instead, it creates new variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.**
