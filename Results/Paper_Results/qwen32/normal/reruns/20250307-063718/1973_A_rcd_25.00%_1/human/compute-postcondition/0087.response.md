Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30). For each test case, it prints a value based on the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and their relationships. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value that can be achieved under the given constraints.**
