To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates while `high >= cur`. In each iteration, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is false, it increments `cur` by 1.

From the given states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`.
- After 2 iterations, `cur` is either `low`, `low + 1`, `low + 2`, or `low + 3`, but `low + 1 <= high`.
- After 3 iterations, `cur` is either `low`, `low + 1`, `low + 2`, or `low + 3`, but `low + 2 <= high`.

The loop will continue until `cur` exceeds `high` or the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met and the loop breaks.

The final output state will depend on whether the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during any of the iterations. If the condition is met, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3`. If the condition is never met and the loop iterates until `cur` exceeds `high`, the output will be `p3`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
- `low` and `high` remain unchanged.
- `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or it will be the value of `cur` when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met and the loop breaks.

Thus, the final output state is determined by whether the loop breaks early or completes all iterations.

Output State: **The loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied during any iteration, or `p3` if the loop completes without finding such a `cur`.
