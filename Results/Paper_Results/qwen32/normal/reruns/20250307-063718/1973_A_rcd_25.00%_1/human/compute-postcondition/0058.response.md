The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not hold any specific value or state that affects the loop's continuation, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring that it remains within the valid range and is still greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, the loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.**
