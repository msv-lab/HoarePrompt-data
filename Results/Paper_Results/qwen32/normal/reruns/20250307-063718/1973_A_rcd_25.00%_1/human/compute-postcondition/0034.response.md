Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.**

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the loop (if within a loop). Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
