To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition.

Given:
- `high` is `p3 - p2`
- `cur` is `p3 - p1`

The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

Substituting the values of `high` and `cur`, the condition becomes:
\[ (p3 - p2) \geq (p3 - p1) \]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[ p3 - p2 \geq p3 - p1 \]
\[ -p2 \geq -p1 \]
\[ p1 \geq p2 \]

However, we already know from the problem statement that `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`. This means that `p1` is already less than or equal to `p2`, which contradicts the simplified condition `p1 >= p2` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the current condition as stated will not allow the loop to execute because `p1` cannot be greater than `p2` given the constraints.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `cur` or `high` such that `high >= cur` holds true. Since `high` is defined as `p3 - p2` and `cur` as `p3 - p1`, and given the constraints, we can adjust `cur` to be less than or equal to `high`.

One straightforward way to ensure the loop executes is to set `cur` to a value that is less than or equal to `high`. Given the constraints, we can set `cur` to `high` itself or any value less than `high`.

Let's set `cur` to `high` to ensure the loop executes:
\[ cur = p3 - p2 \]

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1`; `high` is `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `p3 - p2`**
