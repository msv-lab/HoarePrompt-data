Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). The function returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints.**
