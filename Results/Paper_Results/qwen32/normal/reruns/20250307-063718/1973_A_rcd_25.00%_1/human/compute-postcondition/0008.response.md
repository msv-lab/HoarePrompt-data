Given the initial state provided, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. These are likely the same as `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` mentioned above.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

The print statement is `print(p1 + p2)`, which means we need to determine the value of `p1 + p2`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is an integer, the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (because an even number plus an odd number results in an odd number).

Additionally, `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which gives us a constraint on the values of `p1` and `p2`.

However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only describe the output in terms of the constraints provided.

Given that `p1 + p2` must be even and less than or equal to `p3`, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without more specific input values. But we can describe the output based on the constraints.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even integer less than or equal to p3)**
