To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's break down the given information and the relationships between the variables.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499.
2. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds.
6. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
7. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
8. `cur` is less than or equal to `high`.

### Analysis:
- Since `p3 >= p1 + p2` (given the condition), it implies that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative.
- `low` is the smaller of the two differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the larger of the two differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is a value that is less than or equal to `high`.

### Print Statement:
The statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)` will evaluate to a specific value based on the values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`.

### Calculation:
- `p1 - cur + p3` can be simplified to `p3 + p1 - cur`.
- Since `cur` is a value between `0` and `high` (inclusive), the value of `p3 + p1 - cur` will depend on the specific value of `cur`.

### Output Description:
The exact numerical value of `p1 - cur + p3` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are the input integers and cur is a value such that 0 <= cur <= high)**
