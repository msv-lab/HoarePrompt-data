To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` as they are the only variables in the loop head of the `while` loop.

The loop condition is `while high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is such that `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, otherwise `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2` and `low + 1 <= high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high >= cur` holds true. Since we are only allowed to adjust `high` and `cur`, we need to ensure that `cur` is not greater than `high`.

Given the constraints on `cur` (it can only be `low`, `low + 1`, or `low + 2`), the maximum value `cur` can take is `low + 2`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `low + 2`.

However, since `high` is defined as the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the maximum `high` can be is the larger of the two differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should adjust `high` to be at least `cur`. Since `cur` can be `low`, `low + 1`, or `low + 2`, we need to ensure `high` is at least `low + 2` to cover all possible values `cur` can take.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `high` is at least `low + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `cur` is such that `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, otherwise `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2` and `low + 1 <= high`**.
