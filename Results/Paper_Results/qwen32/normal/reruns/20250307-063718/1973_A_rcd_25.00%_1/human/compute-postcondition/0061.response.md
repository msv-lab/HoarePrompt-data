The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only and moves to the next iteration. Given the provided initial state and the code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. It does not modify the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `cur`, or `high`. It simply continues with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, the loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.**

In simpler terms, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
