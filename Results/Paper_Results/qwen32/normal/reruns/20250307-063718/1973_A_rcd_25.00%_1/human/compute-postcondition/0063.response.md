Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, i.e., `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. Otherwise, there is a loop that either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`. However, since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the else part is never executed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Values of Variables:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, and we know that `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
- Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p1 + p2` must be even or odd depending on the value of `p3` to ensure the total sum is odd.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 + p2**
