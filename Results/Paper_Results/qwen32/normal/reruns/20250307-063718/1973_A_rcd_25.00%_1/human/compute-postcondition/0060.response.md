Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 499\).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- There is a condition: if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds.
- There is a loop that either prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks, or prints `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print(-1)` statement. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `cur`, or `high`. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

### Output:
Since the `print(-1)` statement does not involve any calculations or conditions based on the initial state variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1**
