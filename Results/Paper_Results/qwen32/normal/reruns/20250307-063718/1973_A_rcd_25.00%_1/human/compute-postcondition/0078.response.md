The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is less than or equal to `high`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` should be incremented by 1, ensuring that `cur` is still less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is still less than or equal to `high`.**
