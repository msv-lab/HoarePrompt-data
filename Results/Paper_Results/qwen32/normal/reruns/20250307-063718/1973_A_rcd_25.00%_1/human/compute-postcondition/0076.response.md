The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3 >= p1 + p2` still holds. The relationship between `low` and `high` also remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is less than or equal to `high` and `cur` is incremented by 1.**
