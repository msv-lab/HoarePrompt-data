To determine the output of the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the given conditions:

1. **Initial State and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 499 (though `t` is not directly used in the print statement).
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` holds.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is still less than or equal to `high`.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `p1 - cur + p3` based on the given conditions.

3. **Analyzing the Variables:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are given integers with specific constraints.
   - `cur` is an integer that is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `low` and `high` are derived from `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

4. **Deriving the Output:**
   - The value of `cur` is not explicitly given, but we know it is incremented by 1 and is within the range [1, high].
   - Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is the larger difference between `p3` and either `p1` or `p2`.

Given that `cur` is incremented by 1 and is still less than or equal to `high`, we can say that `cur` can take any value from 1 to `high`. However, without the exact value of `cur`, we can't determine a specific numerical output. Instead, we can describe the output in terms of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p3 are given integers, and cur is an integer such that 1 <= cur <= high, with high being the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
