To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop terminates and what the final state of the variables will be.

### Analysis of the Loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

4. **Else Clause:**
   - If the loop exits without breaking (i.e., `cur` exceeds `high`), it prints `p3`.

### Final Output State:

The loop will continue to increment `cur` until either:
- The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied, at which point it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits.
- `cur` exceeds `high`, at which point it prints `p3` and exits.

Since the problem specifies that the loop has executed 3 times without breaking, it means that:
- After 3 iterations, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` has not been satisfied.
- Therefore, `cur` has been incremented 3 times from its initial value `low`.

### Calculating the Final State:

- **Initial `cur`**: `low` (which is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`).
- **After 3 Iterations**: `cur = low + 3`.

The loop will continue until either:
- `p1 - (low + 3) <= p2 - (p3 - (low + 3))` is satisfied.
- `cur` exceeds `high`.

If the loop does not break after 3 iterations, it will keep incrementing `cur` until `cur` exceeds `high` or the condition is met.

### Final Output:

- If the loop breaks after some iteration (which is not the case here as per the problem statement), it would output `p1 - cur + p3` at that point.
- Since the loop has executed 3 times and has not broken, it will continue until `cur` exceeds `high`. At that point, the `else` clause is executed, and `p3` is printed.

### Conclusion:

The output state after all iterations of the loop, given that it has executed 3 times without breaking, will be:

Output State: **p3**

This means that the final output of the loop, after all iterations, is `p3`.
