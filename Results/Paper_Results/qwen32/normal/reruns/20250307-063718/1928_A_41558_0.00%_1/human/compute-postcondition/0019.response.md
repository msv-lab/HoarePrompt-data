The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2**
