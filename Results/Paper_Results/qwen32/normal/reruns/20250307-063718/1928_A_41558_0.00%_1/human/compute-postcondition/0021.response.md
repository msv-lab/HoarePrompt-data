The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'` as specified in the code.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is set to 2.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
