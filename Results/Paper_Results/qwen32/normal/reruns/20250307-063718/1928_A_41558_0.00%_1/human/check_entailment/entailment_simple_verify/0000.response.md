### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and the annotated code based on the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- He tries to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.
- Determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one.

#### Key Points:
1. **Odd Dimensions**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **One Dimension is Twice the Other**: If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated.
3. **Other Cases**: For all other cases, Bob can form a different rectangle.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO".
2. **One Dimension is Twice the Other**:
   - The program correctly checks if one dimension is twice the other. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO".
3. **Other Cases**:
   - For all other cases, the program prints "YES", which is correct because it means that Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the resulting pieces.

#### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both `a` and `b` are odd, so the answer is "NO". **Correct**.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is not twice the other, and not both are odd, so the answer should be "NO" because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which are the same. **Incorrect**.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES". **Correct**.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES". **Correct**.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES". **Correct**.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is twice the other, so the answer is "NO". **Correct**.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES". **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the test case `a = 2, b = 1` where it should output "NO" but outputs "YES" instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**.
