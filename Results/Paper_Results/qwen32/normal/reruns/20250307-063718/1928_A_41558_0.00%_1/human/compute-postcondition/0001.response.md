The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `t` and the integers `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
