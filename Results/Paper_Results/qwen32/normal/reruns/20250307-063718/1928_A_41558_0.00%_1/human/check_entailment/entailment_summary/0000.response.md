### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`.
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He wants to know if he can form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to form the other.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
     - For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he will end up with two `1x1` rectangles, which can only form a `2x1` or `1x2` rectangle, which is the same as the original.
   - If one dimension is exactly twice the other (e.g., `2x4`), Bob also cannot form a new rectangle because the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that can only form the same original rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
   - It also checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other. If so, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

4. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly identifies cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed (both dimensions odd or one is exactly twice the other).
   - It correctly identifies cases where a new rectangle can be formed (at least one dimension is even).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given rectangle.

### Correctness: **True**
