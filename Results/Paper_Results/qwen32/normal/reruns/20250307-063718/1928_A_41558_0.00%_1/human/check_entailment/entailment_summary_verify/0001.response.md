Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he aims to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The rectangles are considered the same if they are 90-degree rotations of each other.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cut Parallel to the a-Side:**
   - If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\).
   - If \(b\) is odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal integer-sided rectangles.

2. **Cut Parallel to the b-Side:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(b \times 2\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)\).
   - If \(a\) is odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal integer-sided rectangles.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither cutting parallel to the \(a\)-side nor the \(b\)-side will result in two rectangles that can form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the given program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```
- The program first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to form a new rectangle.
- Then, it checks if \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\). If so, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to form a new rectangle.

### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary states:
- The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly twice the other; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the given examples:
1. **Input:** `1 1`
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - Program Output: "NO" (Correct)

2. **Input:** `2 1`
   - One is odd and the other is even, but the ratio is not 2.
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - Program Output: "NO" (Correct)

3. **Input:** `2 6`
   - One is even and the other is not twice the other.
   - Expected Output: "YES"
   - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)

4. **Input:** `3 2`
   - One is even and the other is not twice the other.
   - Expected Output: "YES"
   - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)

5. **Input:** `2 2`
   - Both are even, and neither is twice the other.
   - Expected Output: "YES"
   - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)

6. **Input:** `2 4`
   - One is exactly twice the other.
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - Program Output: "NO" (Correct)

7. **Input:** `6 3`
   - One is exactly twice the other.
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - Program Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
