The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` also within specific ranges. The variables `n` and `i` are mentioned but not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, after executing the code, `a` and `b` will hold the integer values from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
