Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2. The condition checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
