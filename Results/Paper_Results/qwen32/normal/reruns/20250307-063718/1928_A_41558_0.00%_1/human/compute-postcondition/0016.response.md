The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state description provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, as well as conditions related to whether `a` and `b` are odd or even and their relationship. However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Let's break down the information provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- There are conditions based on whether `a` and `b` are odd or even, and whether one is double the other, but none of these conditions affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
