Based on the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **NO**
