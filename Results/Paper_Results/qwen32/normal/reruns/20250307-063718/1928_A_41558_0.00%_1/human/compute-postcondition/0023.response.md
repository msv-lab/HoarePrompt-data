The given initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, and the value of `i`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`, which does not depend on any of these variables. The statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. The variable `n` must be greater than 1.
4. The variable `i` is set to 2.

Despite the presence of these variables, the `print` statement does not reference any of them. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
