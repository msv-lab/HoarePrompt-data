Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer; `i` is equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The loop has processed all `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` and printed 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other; otherwise, it printed 'YES'.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing all `n` iterations, where for each iteration, it read a pair of integers `(a, b)`. It printed 'NO' if both `a` and `b` were odd or if one was exactly twice the other. Otherwise, it printed 'YES'. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain as per their initial state, except `i` now equals `n`, indicating all iterations are complete.
