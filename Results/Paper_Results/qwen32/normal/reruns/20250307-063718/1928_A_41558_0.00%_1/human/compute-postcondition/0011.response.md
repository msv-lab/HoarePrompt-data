Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a`.**
