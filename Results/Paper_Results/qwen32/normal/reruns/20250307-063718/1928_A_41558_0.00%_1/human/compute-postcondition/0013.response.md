The code snippet provided reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b` respectively. The initial state describes the conditions and constraints on `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`, but only `a` and `b` are directly affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input. The conditions related to `a` and `b` (whether they are odd, if one is twice the other) are still valid as per the initial state description.
