Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
   - This condition checks if both dimensions are odd. If so, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd-by-odd rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form another distinct rectangle.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
   - This condition checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other. If so, it prints 'NO', which is incorrect. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and then these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is distinct from a 2x4 rectangle.

3. **Else Condition:** `else:`
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'. This is correct for most cases where the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The issue lies in the second condition. The program incorrectly assumes that if one dimension is exactly twice the other, Bob cannot form another rectangle. However, as shown in the example with a 2x4 rectangle, this is not true. The correct approach should be to check if both dimensions are not equal and not both odd, as this allows for the possibility of forming a different rectangle.

A corrected version of the program would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly handles the cases where the rectangle can be rearranged to form a different one.
