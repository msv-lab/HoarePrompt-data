Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the conditions under which Bob cannot form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle. Specifically, the program checks two conditions:
1. If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, it is not possible to form another rectangle because cutting the rectangle would result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being 1, and these two 1xN rectangles can only form the same 1x(2N) rectangle.
2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other, cutting the rectangle parallel to the longer side would result in two rectangles of the same dimensions, and thus, they can only form the same rectangle.

The program correctly handles these two scenarios by printing 'NO' in these cases. For all other cases, it prints 'YES', which is correct because Bob can always form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging the two resulting rectangles.

The program also efficiently handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
