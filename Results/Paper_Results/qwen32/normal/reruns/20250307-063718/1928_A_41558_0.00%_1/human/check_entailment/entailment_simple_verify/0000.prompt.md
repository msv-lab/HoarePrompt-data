You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.

        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer; `i` is equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The loop has processed all `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` and printed 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other; otherwise, it printed 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he tries to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The two resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved as needed. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other. The task is to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one using the two smaller rectangles.

### Key Points:
- If `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles of dimensions `a x (b/2)` or `(a/2) x b`, and these can form a new rectangle that is not just a rotation of `a x b`, then the answer is "Yes".
- If `a` and `b` are both odd, then it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the answer is "No".
- If one dimension is twice the other, then the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated, so the answer is "No".

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **One Dimension is Twice the Other**:
   - The program also correctly checks if one dimension is twice the other. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated.
3. **Other Cases**:
   - For all other cases, the program prints "YES", which is correct because it means that Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the resulting pieces.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both `a` and `b` are odd, so the answer is "NO".
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is not twice the other, and not both are odd, so the answer is "YES". However, this is incorrect as it should be "NO" because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which are the same.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is twice the other, so the answer is "NO", which is correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the test case `a = 2, b = 1` where it should output "NO" but outputs "YES" instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
