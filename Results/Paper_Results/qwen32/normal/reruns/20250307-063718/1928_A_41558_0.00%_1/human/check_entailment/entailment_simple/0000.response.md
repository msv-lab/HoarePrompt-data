### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. The key points are:
1. If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the only resulting rectangles after cutting and reassembling would be the same as the original rectangle (or its 90-degree rotation).

Let's analyze the provided code based on these points:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
       print('NO')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where both dimensions are odd. Since it's impossible to cut such a rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, the output is 'NO'.

2. **One Dimension is Twice the Other**:
   ```python
   elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
       print('NO')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where one dimension is exactly twice the other. In such cases, the only possible resulting rectangle is the same as the original rectangle (or its 90-degree rotation), so the output is 'NO'.

3. **All Other Cases**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('YES')
   ```
   - For all other cases, the output is 'YES', indicating that it is possible to form a different rectangle. This is correct because any other combination of dimensions allows for the creation of a different rectangle after cutting and reassembling.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a different rectangle can be formed from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the conditions provided.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles all edge cases and provides the correct output based on the problem's requirements.
Correctness: **True**
