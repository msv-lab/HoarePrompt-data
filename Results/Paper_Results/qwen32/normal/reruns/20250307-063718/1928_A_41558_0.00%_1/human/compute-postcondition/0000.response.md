Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
