Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program, considering the annotated code and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he aims to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The rectangles are considered the same if they are 90-degree rotations of each other.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cut Parallel to the a-Side:**
   - If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times b\), but we need to check if we can form a different rectangle. If \(a\) is even, these two rectangles can be arranged to form a rectangle of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal rectangles with integer sides.

2. **Cut Parallel to the b-Side:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times b\), but we need to check if we can form a different rectangle. If \(b\) is even, these two rectangles can be arranged to form a rectangle of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - If \(a\) is odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal rectangles with integer sides.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither cutting parallel to the \(a\)-side nor the \(b\)-side will result in two rectangles that can form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), then the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the given program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```
- The program first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to form a new rectangle.
- Then, it checks if \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\). If so, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to form a new rectangle.

### Evaluation of the Program:
The program correctly handles the conditions for forming a new rectangle based on the problem description. Let's verify the logic with the annotated code:

1. **If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd:**
   - The program correctly prints "NO" because neither cutting parallel to the \(a\)-side nor the \(b\)-side will result in two rectangles that can form a new rectangle.

2. **If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\):**
   - The program correctly prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.

3. **If neither of the above conditions is met:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" because it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging the resulting rectangles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions for forming a new rectangle based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
