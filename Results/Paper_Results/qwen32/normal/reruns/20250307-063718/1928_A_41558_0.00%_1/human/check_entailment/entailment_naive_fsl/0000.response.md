Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he tries to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The two resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved as needed. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other. The task is to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one using the two smaller rectangles.

### Key Points:
- If `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles of dimensions `a x (b/2)` or `(a/2) x b`, and these can form a new rectangle that is not just a rotation of `a x b`, then the answer is "Yes".
- If `a` and `b` are both odd, then it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the answer is "No".
- If one dimension is twice the other, then the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated, so the answer is "No".

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **One Dimension is Twice the Other**:
   - The program also correctly checks if one dimension is twice the other. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated.
3. **Other Cases**:
   - For all other cases, the program prints "YES", which is correct because it means that Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the resulting pieces.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both `a` and `b` are odd, so the answer is "NO".
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is not twice the other, and not both are odd, so the answer is "YES". However, this is incorrect as it should be "NO" because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which are the same.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is twice the other, so the answer is "NO", which is correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - Neither both dimensions are odd nor one is twice the other, so the answer is "YES", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the test case `a = 2, b = 1` where it should output "NO" but outputs "YES" instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
