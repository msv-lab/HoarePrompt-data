Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
