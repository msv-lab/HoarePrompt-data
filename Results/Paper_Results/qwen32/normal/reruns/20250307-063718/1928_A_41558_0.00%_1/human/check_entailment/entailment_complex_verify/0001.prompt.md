You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer; `i` is equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The loop has processed all `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` and printed 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other; otherwise, it printed 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly twice the other; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he aims to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The rectangles are considered the same if they are 90-degree rotations of each other.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cut Parallel to the a-Side:**
   - The rectangle is cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
   - If \(b\) is odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle because the resulting rectangles would be of size \(a \times \left(\frac{b-1}{2}\right)\) and \(a \times \left(\frac{b+1}{2}\right)\), and they cannot be combined to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

2. **Cut Parallel to the b-Side:**
   - The rectangle is cut into two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle because the resulting rectangles would be of size \(\left(\frac{a-1}{2}\right) \times b\) and \(\left(\frac{a+1}{2}\right) \times b\), and they cannot be combined to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither cutting parallel to the \(a\)-side nor the \(b\)-side will result in two rectangles that can form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), then the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the given program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```
- The program first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to form a new rectangle.
- Then, it checks if \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\). If so, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles from the cut will be identical and can only form the same rectangle as the original.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions for forming a new rectangle based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
