The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

The states of `t`, `a`, `b`, and the conditions related to them do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a`.**
