The given code snippet consists of a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`, but these variables are not directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output `'YES'` regardless of the input values.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the context in which the code will run, including the number of test cases `t` and the integers `a` and `b` for each test case.
2. The conditions on `a` and `b` (such as at least one of them being even, and neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a`) are provided but do not affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
