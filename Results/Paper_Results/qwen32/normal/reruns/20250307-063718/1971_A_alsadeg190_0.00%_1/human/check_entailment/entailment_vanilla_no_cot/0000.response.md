Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the print statement. It should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. However, in the code, if `x > y`, it incorrectly prints `x` first and `y` second. It should be corrected to always print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. Here is the corrected print statement:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)  # Corrected: print the smaller number first
        else:
            print(x, y)  # Corrected: print the smaller number first
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `min` and `max` functions for clarity:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```
