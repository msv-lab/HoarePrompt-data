Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input and \(0 \leq y \leq 9\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y, x)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(y, x)` statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. 

- `y` is the second integer from the input and is constrained to be between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and its value is not constrained by any specific range in the problem statement.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
