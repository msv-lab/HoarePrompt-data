You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `t` iterations, the loop reads two integers `x` and `y` (with `0 <= y <= 9`) from the input. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The variables `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration based on the new input values, but `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers, and for each test case, output the minimum and maximum of those two integers in that order. However, there is a logical error in the print statements within the loop. The program currently prints `x y` if `x > y`, which is incorrect because it should print the smaller number first. Instead, it should print `y x` in this case. Conversely, if `x <= y`, it correctly prints `y x`, but this should be `x y` to match the problem's requirement.

To fix the program, the print statements should be swapped:
- When `x > y`, print `y x` (minimum first, maximum second).
- When `x <= y`, print `x y` (minimum first, maximum second).

Given the current implementation, the output will be incorrect for cases where `x > y`, as it prints the larger number first.

Correctness: **False**
