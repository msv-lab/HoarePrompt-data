The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `y` respectively. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` must be greater than 0, and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= 9. After executing the code, `x` and `y` will be updated to the values provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input and 0 <= y <= 9.**
