The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet reassigns `x` and `y` with new values from the input, so the original values of `x` and `y` are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input with 0 <= y <= 9, `i` is incremented by 1.**
