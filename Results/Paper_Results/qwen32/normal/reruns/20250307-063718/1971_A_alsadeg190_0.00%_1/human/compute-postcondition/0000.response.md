The code snippet `x = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9. After the code executes, the value of `x` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, but the value of `y` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= 9.**
