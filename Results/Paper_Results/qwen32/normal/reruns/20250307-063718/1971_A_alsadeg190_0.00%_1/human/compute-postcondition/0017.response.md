Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input with 0 <= y <= 9, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `x > y` is evaluated, but the values of `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
