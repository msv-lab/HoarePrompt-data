To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This variable `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input and 0 <= y <= 9.

The print statement is:
```python
print(x, y)
```

Given the initial state, we know the values of `x` and `y` come from the input, but their exact values are not specified. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `x` and `y` as defined.

The print statement will output the values of `x` and `y` separated by a space.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input, with 0 <= y <= 9)**
