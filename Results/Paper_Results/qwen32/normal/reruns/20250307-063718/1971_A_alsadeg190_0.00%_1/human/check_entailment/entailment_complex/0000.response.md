Reasoning:  
The provided program logic is incorrect based on the problem description. The program is supposed to print the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. However, the program currently prints `x` followed by `y` if `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` followed by `x` if `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. This means the larger number is always printed first, which is the opposite of what is required.

The correct logic should be to print the minimum value first and then the maximum value for each pair of `x` and `y`.

Here is the corrected version of the loop:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

Correctness: **False**
