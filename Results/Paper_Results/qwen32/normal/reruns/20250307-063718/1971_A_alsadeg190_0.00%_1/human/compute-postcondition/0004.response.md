Given the initial state, we know that `x` and `y` are integers where `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `0 <= y <= 9`. Additionally, it is specified that `x` is greater than `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot determine their specific numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x` and `y` based on the given conditions.

The `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of `x` and `y` separated by a space.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input, y is the second integer from the input, and x > y)**
