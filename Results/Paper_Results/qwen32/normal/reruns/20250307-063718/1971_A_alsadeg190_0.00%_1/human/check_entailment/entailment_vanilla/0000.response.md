Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers, and for each test case, output the minimum and maximum of those two integers in that order. However, there is a logical error in the print statements within the loop. The program currently prints `x y` if `x > y`, which is incorrect because it should print the smaller number first. Instead, it should print `y x` in this case. Conversely, if `x <= y`, it correctly prints `y x`, but this should be `x y` to match the problem's requirement.

To fix the program, the print statements should be swapped:
- When `x > y`, print `y x` (minimum first, maximum second).
- When `x <= y`, print `x y` (minimum first, maximum second).

Given the current implementation, the output will be incorrect for cases where `x > y`, as it prints the larger number first.

Correctness: **False**
