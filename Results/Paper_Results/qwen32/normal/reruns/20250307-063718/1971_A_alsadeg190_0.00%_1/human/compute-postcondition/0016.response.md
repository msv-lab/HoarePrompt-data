The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but it does not provide explicit values for `x` and `y` other than their ranges and constraints. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the new input.
- `y` is the second integer from the new input with 0 <= y <= 9.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the print statement.

Given this information, the `print(y, x)` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` as they are provided from the new input, with `y` being a single digit (0 to 9) and `x` being an integer without a specified range.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe their nature based on the given constraints.

Output: **y, x (where y is an integer between 0 and 9, and x is an integer)**
