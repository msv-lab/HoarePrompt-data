Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to output the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case, but there is a logical error in the print statement. The program currently prints `x, y` when `x > y` and `y, x` when `x <= y`. This results in the larger number being printed first, which is the opposite of what is required by the problem description. The problem requires the smaller number to be printed first, followed by the larger number.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
