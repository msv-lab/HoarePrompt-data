The code snippet assigns new values to `x` and `y` based on the input. The initial state of `x` and `y` is overridden by the values provided in the input. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are no longer relevant because `x` and `y` are reassigned. The variable `i` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input and 0 <= y <= 9.**
