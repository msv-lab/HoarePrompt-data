Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. Instead, it prints the larger integer first and the smaller integer second, which is the opposite of what is required by the problem description.

For example, given the input:
```
1
1 9
```
The program will output:
```
9 1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
1 9
```

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
if x > y:
    print(x, y)
else:
    print(y, x)
```
This condition should be reversed to ensure the minimum value is printed first, followed by the maximum value:
```python
if x < y:
    print(x, y)
else:
    print(y, x)
```
or more simply:
```python
print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
