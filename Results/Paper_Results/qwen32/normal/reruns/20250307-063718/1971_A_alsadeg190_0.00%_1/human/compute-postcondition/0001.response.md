The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `t`, `x`, and `y` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but only `x` affects the execution of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= 9**
