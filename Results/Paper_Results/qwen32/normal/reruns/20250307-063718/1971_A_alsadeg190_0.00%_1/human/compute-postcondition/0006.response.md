Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input and 0 <= y <= 9.
- `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

This statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables themselves, given the constraints.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input, with the constraint that 0 <= y <= 9 and x <= y)**
