Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `t` iterations, the loop reads two integers `x` and `y` (with `0 <= y <= 9`) from the input. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The variables `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration based on the new input values, but `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where 0 <= x, y <= 9, and prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one.
