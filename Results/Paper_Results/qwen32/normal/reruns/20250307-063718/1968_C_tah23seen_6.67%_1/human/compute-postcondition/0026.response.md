Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 3, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 5, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `ans[1]` is updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`, which results in `5` since `ans[1]` was `3` and `ans[0]` is `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
