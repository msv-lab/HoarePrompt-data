Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, and `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, `ans[i + 1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + m * ans[i]` for some integer `m`. Otherwise, `ans[i + 1]` remains as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.**
