To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the loop condition:
```
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
```
The loop will continue to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr[0]` is 1
- `arr[1]` must be at least 5
- `ans[0]` is 2
- `ans[1]` is 7
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` must be true. Given `i` is 0, this translates to `ans[1] <= arr[1]`.

Currently:
- `ans[1]` is 7
- `arr[1]` must be at least 5

Since `ans[1]` (7) is not less than or equal to `arr[1]` (which must be at least 5), the loop would not execute again with the current state. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `arr[1]` to be at least 7 (since `ans[1]` is 7).

State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` must be at least 7, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 7, `i` is 0**
