The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[1]` by adding the value of `ans[0]` to it. Given that `i` is 0, `ans[0]` is 2, and `ans[1]` is 5, the new value of `ans[1]` will be `5 + 2 = 7`.

The values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` must be at least 5, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 7, `i` is 0**
