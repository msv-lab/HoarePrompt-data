The given code updates the element at index `i + 1` of the list `ans` with the value of `arr[i] + ans[i]`. 

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.

After executing the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`, the value at `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and the other elements of `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]`.**
