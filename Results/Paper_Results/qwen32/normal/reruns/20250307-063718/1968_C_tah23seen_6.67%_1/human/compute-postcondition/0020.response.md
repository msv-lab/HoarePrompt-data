The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments the value of `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this operation modifies `ans[1]` by adding `ans[0]` to it. Since `ans[0]` is 2 and `ans[1]` is 7, `ans[1]` becomes 9. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` must be at least 7, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 9, `i` is 0**.
