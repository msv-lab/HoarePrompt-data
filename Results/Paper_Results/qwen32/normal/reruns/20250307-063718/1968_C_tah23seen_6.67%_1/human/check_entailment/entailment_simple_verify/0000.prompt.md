You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

    for i in ans:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function is called for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze the code with a test case:

Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 1
3
1 5
```

The expected output should be any valid array `a` that satisfies the conditions. For example:
- For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 1]`, a valid output could be `2 5 11` because:
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `11 % 5 = 1`
- For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 5]`, a valid output could be `2 7 5` because:
  - `7 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 7 = 5`

However, let's see what the given code produces for these inputs. For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 1]`, the code might produce something like `2 3 4`, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 % 2 = 1` (correct)
- `4 % 3 = 1` (incorrect, should be `4 % 3 = 1` but the code does not guarantee this)

For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 5]`, the code might produce something like `2 3 8`, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 % 2 = 1` (correct)
- `8 % 3 = 2` (incorrect, should be `8 % 3 = 5` but the code does not guarantee this)

The main issue is that the logic in `func_1` for constructing the array `ans` does not correctly ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The while loop and the way `ans[i + 1]` is calculated are not sufficient to guarantee the required conditions for all possible inputs.

To fix this, a different approach is needed. One simple and correct approach is to set `a_1` to any value greater than `x_1` (e.g., `a_1 = x_1 + 1`), and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed in such a way that the remainder condition is satisfied.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

With this corrected function, the code should work correctly for all valid inputs.
