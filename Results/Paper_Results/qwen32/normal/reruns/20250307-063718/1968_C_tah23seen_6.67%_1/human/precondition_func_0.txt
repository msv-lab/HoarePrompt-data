arr is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function is called for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
