The code snippet `ans = [0] * n` initializes a list named `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, and `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`. The value of `n` is not changed by this code snippet, and `arr` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
