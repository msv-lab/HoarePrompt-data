To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop.

The loop condition is:
```
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
```

This means that for the loop to execute again, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`.
- `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`.
- The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is greater than its initial value by `ans[i]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's break down the condition:
- `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`.
- For the loop to execute again, `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`.

Given that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than its initial value by `ans[i]`, we need to adjust `arr[i + 1]` to ensure it is greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`**
