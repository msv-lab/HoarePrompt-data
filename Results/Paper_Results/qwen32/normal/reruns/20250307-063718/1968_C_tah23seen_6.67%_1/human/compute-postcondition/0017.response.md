To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the loop condition:
```
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
```
The loop will continue to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

From the provided state:
- `arr[0]` is 1
- `arr[1]` is at least 3
- `ans[0]` is 2
- `ans[1]` is 5
- `i` is 0

In the current state, the loop condition checks `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, which translates to `ans[1] <= arr[1]` or `5 <= arr[1]`.

Since `arr[1]` is at least 3, the current condition `5 <= arr[1]` is not satisfied (because `arr[1]` must be at least 5 for the condition to be true).

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `arr[1]` so that `ans[1] <= arr[1]` is true. Therefore, `arr[1]` must be at least 5.

No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` must be at least 5, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 5, `i` is 0**
