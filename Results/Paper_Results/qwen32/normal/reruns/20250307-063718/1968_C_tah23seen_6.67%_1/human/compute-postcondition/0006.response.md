The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ans[i + 1]` is initially less than `arr[i + 1]`. After the operation, `ans[i + 1]` will be increased by `ans[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is greater than its initial value by `ans[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to be `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
