To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list based on the `arr` list and the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates `n - 2` times, updating the `ans` list as follows:
1. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n - 3`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
2. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a `while` loop, incrementing `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from `0` to `n - 3`, the value of `ans[i + 1]` is calculated based on the above rules.

Let's break down the steps for all iterations:

1. **Initialization**: `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
2. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0]`
   - If `ans[1] < arr[1]`, increment `ans[1]` by `ans[0]` until `ans[1] > arr[1]`
3. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1]`
   - If `ans[2] < arr[2]`, increment `ans[2]` by `ans[1]` until `ans[2] > arr[2]`
4. **...**
5. **(n-2)th Iteration (i = n - 3)**:
   - `ans[n-2] = arr[n-3] + ans[n-3]`
   - If `ans[n-2] < arr[n-2]`, increment `ans[n-2]` by `ans[n-3]` until `ans[n-2] > arr[n-2]`

The final state of `ans` after all iterations is determined by these calculations. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged, and the initial condition `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` holds true throughout the loop.

**Output State: **`ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, with the condition that if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the final `ans` list is constructed by iteratively adding the previous `ans` value to the corresponding `arr` value, ensuring that each `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `arr[i + 1]` if necessary by adding multiples of the previous `ans` value.
