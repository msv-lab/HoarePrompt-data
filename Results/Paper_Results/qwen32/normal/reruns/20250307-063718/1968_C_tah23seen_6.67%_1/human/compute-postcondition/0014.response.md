Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language: The variable `ans` now includes an additional element at index `i + 1` which is the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
