Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.**

In simple terms, the first element of the `ans` list is now set to the first element of the `arr` list plus one, while all other elements in `ans` remain zeros. The `arr` list and `n` remain unchanged.
