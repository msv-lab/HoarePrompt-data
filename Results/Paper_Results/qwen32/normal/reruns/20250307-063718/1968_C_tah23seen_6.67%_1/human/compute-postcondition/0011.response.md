To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list. The loop continues to execute while the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is true. Each time the loop executes, it adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]`.
- After 2 iterations, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.
- After 3 iterations, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`.

Following this pattern, after `k` iterations, `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + (k + 1) * ans[i]`. The loop will stop executing when `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + (k + 1) * ans[i]`.

Let's denote the number of iterations for a specific `i` as `k_i`. The loop will stop when `arr[i] + (k_i + 1) * ans[i] > arr[i + 1]`, meaning `k_i` is the largest integer such that `arr[i] + k_i * ans[i] <= arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + (k_i + 1) * ans[i]`.

The final output state of the loop, after all iterations, will be:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + (k_i + 1) * ans[i]`, where `k_i` is the number of iterations for that specific `i`.

In simpler terms, `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + m * ans[i]` for some integer `m`.

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + m * ans[i]` for some integer `m`.**
