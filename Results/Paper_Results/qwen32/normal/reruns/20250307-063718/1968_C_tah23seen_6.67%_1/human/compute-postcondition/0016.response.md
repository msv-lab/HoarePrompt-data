The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[1]` by adding the value of `ans[0]` to it. Given that `i` is 0, `ans[0]` is 2, and `ans[1]` is 3, the new value of `ans[1]` will be `3 + 2 = 5`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 3, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 5, `i` is 0**.
