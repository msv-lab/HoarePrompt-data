Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`, but the current implementation does not guarantee this condition.

Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The initial value of `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, which is not necessarily correct. The problem does not specify what `a_1` should be, but it must be at least `x_2 + 1` to ensure `x_2 = a_2 % a_1`.

2. The loop for filling the `ans` array is incorrect. The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent `while` loop are not addressing the problem correctly. The goal is to ensure that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i + 1]`, not just that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

3. The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which again does not guarantee that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`.

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a value greater than `x_2` and then iteratively set each subsequent `a_i` to `a_(i-1) + x_i` or a multiple of `a_(i-1)` that satisfies the modulo condition.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a_1 should be greater than x_2
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This ensures that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, a more robust solution would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9`) to simplify the calculations:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10**9] * n  # Set a_1 to a large number
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This approach guarantees that the conditions are met, and it is simple to implement.
