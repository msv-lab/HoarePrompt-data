To determine the output state, we need to understand the construction of the list `ans` based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.

2. **Subsequent Elements**:
   - For each `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Final Element**:
   - `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Given the initial state and the rules for constructing `ans`, we can summarize the final state of `ans` as follows:

- The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- Each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is calculated based on the previous element and the corresponding element in `arr`, with the condition that it must be greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
