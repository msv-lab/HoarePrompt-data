The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[1]` by adding the value of `ans[0]` to it. Given the initial state, `ans[0]` is 2 and `ans[1]` is less than or equal to 3. After the operation, `ans[1]` will be `ans[1] + ans[0]`, which means `ans[1]` will be `ans[1] + 2`. Since `ans[1]` was initially less than or equal to 3, after the operation, `ans[1]` will be between 4 and 5 (inclusive of 4 and exclusive of 5, but since we are dealing with integers, it will be exactly 4 or 5).

Given the constraints, the only possible values for `ans[1]` after the operation are 4 or 5. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 3, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is either 4 or 5, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `i` is 0**
