You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Annotated Code:

    n = int(input())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function is called for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, with the condition that if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusted by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` which contains `n-1` elements.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element of `ans` to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2` (since `x_2 = a_2 % a_1` and `x_2 >= 1`).

3. **Building the Array `ans`**:
   - The program iterates through the array `arr` to set the values of `ans` from index 1 to `n-2`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-3`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = x_{i+2}`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]`.

4. **Setting the Last Element**:
   - The last element of `ans` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- The program ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2` by setting `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent element, it ensures that the condition `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = x_{i+2}` is met by incrementing `ans[i + 1]` until the condition holds.
- The final element is set to ensure that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

**Input**:
```
4
2 4 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
3 5 4 9
```

**Program Output**:
- `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5`
- `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since `9 % 5 = 4` which is `x_3`)
- `ans[3] = ans[2] + arr[2] = 9 + 1 = 10` but adjusted to `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (since `15 % 9 = 6` which is not `x_4`), so it is adjusted to `9 + 1 = 10` and then `10 + 5 = 15` again, but the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect), so the correct adjustment is `9 + 1 + 5 = 15` (which is incorrect).

The program seems to be incorrect as it does not correctly adjust the values to meet the conditions for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
