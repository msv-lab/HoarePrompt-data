Let's analyze the provided program and its execution summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.
- We need to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
  - `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr` of size `n-1`.
- It calls `func_1(arr, n)` to generate the array `ans`.
- The function `func_1` constructs the array `ans` in the following way:
  - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
  - For `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`. If `ans[i + 1]` is not greater than `arr[i + 1]`, it keeps adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
  - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the constructed array `ans` satisfies the conditions:

1. **Initial Condition**:
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`. This ensures `ans[0] > 0` and `ans[0]` is not equal to `arr[0]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - For `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusted so that `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]`. This ensures `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]` because `ans[i + 1]` is constructed such that it is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that leaves a remainder of `arr[i]` when divided by `ans[i]`.

3. **Final Element Condition**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures `ans[-1] % ans[-2] = arr[-1]` because `ans[-1]` is constructed by adding `arr[-1]` to `ans[-2]`.

### Execution Summary Validation:
- The execution summary aligns with the described behavior of `func_1`. It correctly initializes `ans[0]`, iteratively calculates and adjusts `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3`, and finally sets `ans[-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program constructs the array `ans` such that it meets the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
