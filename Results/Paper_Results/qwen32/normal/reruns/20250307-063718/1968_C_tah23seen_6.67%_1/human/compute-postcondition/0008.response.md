The given code modifies the `ans` list by updating the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of its current value and `ans[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `ans[i + 1]` was previously defined as `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`. After executing the line `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]`, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`, which simplifies to `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`.**
