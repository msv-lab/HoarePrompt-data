Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and incremented by `ans[i]` until it exceeds `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
