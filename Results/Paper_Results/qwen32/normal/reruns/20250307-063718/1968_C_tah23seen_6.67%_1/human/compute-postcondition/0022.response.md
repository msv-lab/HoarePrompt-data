Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]`. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 7, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 9, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `arr`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remains as per the initial conditions.**
