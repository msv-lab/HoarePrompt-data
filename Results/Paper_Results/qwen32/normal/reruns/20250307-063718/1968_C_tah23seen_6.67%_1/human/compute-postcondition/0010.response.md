The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` will be doubled from its previous definition of `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]` to `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans[i + 1]` was defined as `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`. After the code execution, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i] + ans[i]`, which simplifies to `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`.

The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`**.
