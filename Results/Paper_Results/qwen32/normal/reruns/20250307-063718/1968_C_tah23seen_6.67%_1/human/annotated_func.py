#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function is called for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `ans[i + 1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, with the condition that if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusted by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
