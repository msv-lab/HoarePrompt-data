Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze the code with a test case:

Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 1
3
1 5
```

The expected output should be any valid array `a` that satisfies the conditions. For example:
- For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 1]`, a valid output could be `2 5 11` because:
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `11 % 5 = 1`
- For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 5]`, a valid output could be `2 7 5` because:
  - `7 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 7 = 5`

However, let's see what the given code produces for these inputs. For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 1]`, the code might produce something like `2 3 4`, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 % 2 = 1` (correct)
- `4 % 3 = 1` (incorrect, should be `4 % 3 = 1` but the code does not guarantee this)

For `n=3` and `arr=[1, 5]`, the code might produce something like `2 3 8`, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 % 2 = 1` (correct)
- `8 % 3 = 2` (incorrect, should be `8 % 3 = 5` but the code does not guarantee this)

The main issue is that the logic in `func_1` for constructing the array `ans` does not correctly ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The while loop and the way `ans[i + 1]` is calculated are not sufficient to guarantee the required conditions for all possible inputs.

To fix this, a different approach is needed. One simple and correct approach is to set `a_1` to any value greater than `x_1` (e.g., `a_1 = x_1 + 1`), and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed in such a way that the remainder condition is satisfied.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

With this corrected function, the code should work correctly for all valid inputs.
