To determine the final output state, we need to analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations. The loop modifies `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.

From the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`.
- `ans` is initialized with `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[i + 1]` is initialized with `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
- `i` starts at 0.

The loop condition is `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, and in each iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]`.

From the given output states:
1. After 1 iteration: `ans[1]` is 5, which is `ans[0] + ans[0]` (2 + 2 + 1).
2. After 2 iterations: `ans[1]` is 7, which is `ans[1] + ans[0]` (5 + 2).
3. After 3 iterations: `ans[1]` is 9, which is `ans[1] + ans[0]` (7 + 2).

The pattern suggests that `ans[1]` is incremented by `ans[0]` (which is 2) in each iteration. This will continue until `ans[1]` exceeds `arr[1]`.

To generalize, the loop will continue to add `ans[0]` to `ans[1]` until `ans[1]` is greater than `arr[1]`. The final value of `ans[1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as `ans[1] = arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)`, where `k` is the number of iterations.

Given that `arr[0]` is 1, `ans[0]` is 2, and `ans[1]` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the final value of `ans[1]` will be the smallest odd number greater than `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `arr[0]` remains 1.
- `arr[1]` remains as given.
- `ans[0]` remains 2.
- `ans[1]` is the smallest odd number greater than `arr[1]`.
- `i` remains 0 as the loop only modifies `ans[i + 1]`.

Output State: **arr[0] is 1, arr[1] is at least 7, ans[0] is 2, ans[1] is 9, i is 0.**

In natural language: The final state after all iterations is that `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 7, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 9, and `i` is 0. Here, `ans[1]` is the smallest odd number greater than `arr[1]`, which is 9 when `arr[1]` is at least 7.
