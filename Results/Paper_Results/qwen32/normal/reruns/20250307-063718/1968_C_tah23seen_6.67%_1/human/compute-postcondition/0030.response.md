The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `ans[0]` is 2, and `ans[1]` is either 4 or 5, the value of `ans[1]` will be updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`, which is `4 + 2` or `5 + 2`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans[1]` will be either 6 or 7. The values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` must be at least 4, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is either 6 or 7, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `i` is 0**.
