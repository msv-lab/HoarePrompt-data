Functionality: **The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-3` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusted by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
