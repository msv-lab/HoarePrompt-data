Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to construct an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`, where `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are given. The program provided is supposed to achieve this.

Let's break down the function `func_1` and see if it correctly constructs the array `a`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`: This sets the first element of the array `a` to be `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `a_1` can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, and setting it to `arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_1 > x_2` (since `x_2 <= 500`).

2. **Iteration**:
   - For `i` from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`. This step ensures that `ans[i + 1] > arr[i]` initially, but it might not satisfy `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]`.
   - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]: ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` adjusts `ans[i + 1]` to be greater than `arr[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly. This loop ensures that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]` by making `ans[i + 1]` a multiple of `ans[i]` plus `arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Final Element**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`: This sets the last element of the array `a` to be `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n` because `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` implies `ans[-1] % ans[-2] = arr[-1]`.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The while loop condition `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is incorrect. It should be `while ans[i + 1] % ans[i] != arr[i + 1]` to ensure that the remainder is exactly `arr[i + 1]`. The current condition can lead to an incorrect result if `ans[i + 1]` is not properly adjusted to satisfy the modulo condition.

Therefore, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
