To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop behavior step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`.
- `ans` is initialized with `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` for `i >= 0`.

### Loop Condition and Behavior:
The loop continues as long as `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. Inside the loop, `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` in each iteration.

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `arr[1]` is at least 3.
   - `ans[0]` is 2.
   - `ans[1]` is 5.
   - `n` remains `3 <= n <= 500`.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `arr[1]` is at least 3.
   - `ans[0]` is 2.
   - `ans[1]` is either 4 or 5.
   - `n` remains `3 <= n <= 500`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `arr[1]` is at least 4.
   - `ans[0]` is 2.
   - `ans[1]` is either 6 or 7.
   - `n` remains `3 <= n <= 500`.
   - `i` is 0.

### Conclusion After Each Iteration:
- The loop modifies `ans[1]` by adding `ans[0]` to it in each iteration.
- The loop continues until `ans[1]` exceeds `arr[1]`.

### Final Output State:
Given the output states after 3 iterations, we can infer that `arr[1]` must be such that `ans[1]` needs to exceed it. From the provided states, `arr[1]` must be at least 4, and `ans[1]` after 3 iterations is either 6 or 7. Since the loop stops when `ans[1]` exceeds `arr[1]`, the final state will be when `ans[1]` is the smallest value that exceeds `arr[1]`.

Assuming the smallest `arr[1]` that fits the conditions is 4, the loop will stop after `ans[1]` becomes 7 (since 6 is not sufficient to exceed 4).

### Final Output State:
- `arr[0]` remains 1.
- `arr[1]` is at least 4.
- `ans[0]` remains 2.
- `ans[1]` is 7.
- `n` remains `3 <= n <= 500`.
- `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is at least 4, `ans[0]` is 2, `ans[1]` is 7, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `i` is 0.**
