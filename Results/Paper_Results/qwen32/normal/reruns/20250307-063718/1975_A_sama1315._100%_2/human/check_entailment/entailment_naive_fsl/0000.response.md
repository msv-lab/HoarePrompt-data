Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if the array `a` can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing order. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Explanation of `func_1`:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`, which represents the non-decreasing order of `a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array**: The function then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The function checks all possible subarrays of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`. If a match is found, it means that by splitting and swapping parts of `a`, we can achieve a non-decreasing order, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no match is found after checking all possible subarrays, the function returns 'No'.

### Explanation of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all input data at once and processes it.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
3. **Calling `func_1`**: It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and stores the result.
4. **Printing Results**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Concatenation and Subarray Check**: The approach of concatenating the array with itself and checking for subarrays of length `n` that match the sorted array is a valid method to determine if the array can be split and swapped to form a non-decreasing order. This is because any valid split and swap operation can be represented as a subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or arrays that cannot be sorted by any split and swap operation. For example, the first test case in the problem description correctly returns 'No' because no valid split and swap can sort the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
- **Efficiency**: The code efficiently checks all possible splits by leveraging the concatenated array, ensuring that it covers all potential scenarios.

Since the program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases, it is considered correct.
