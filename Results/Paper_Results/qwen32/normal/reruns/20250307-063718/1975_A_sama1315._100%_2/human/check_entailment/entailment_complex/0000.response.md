### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The solution involves checking if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array.

**Function Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - It takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`.
    - The idea here is that if the array can be rotated into a sorted form, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subsequence in the doubled array.
    - This approach is correct because rotating the array is equivalent to taking a contiguous subsequence of length `n` from the doubled array.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It reads the input for multiple test cases.
    - For each test case, it extracts the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
    - It then calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by rotations and stores the result.
    - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

**Correctness Verification:**

- **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - The logic of checking for a sorted subsequence in the doubled array is correct.
    - The function correctly handles the constraint `2 <= n <= 50` and the element values `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
    - It correctly calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and collects the results.
    - It prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
