The code snippet provided is `result = func_1(a)`. This line of code assigns the value returned by the function `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. 

Given the initial state, `result` already holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`, which means that executing this line does not change the value of `result`. It simply reassigns it to itself.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the exception that the reassignment is explicitly noted.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
