You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if the array `a` can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing order. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Explanation of `func_1`:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`, which represents the non-decreasing order of `a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array**: The function then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The function checks all possible subarrays of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`. If a match is found, it means that by splitting and swapping parts of `a`, we can achieve a non-decreasing order, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no match is found after checking all possible subarrays, the function returns 'No'.

### Explanation of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all input data at once and processes it.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
3. **Calling `func_1`**: It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and stores the result.
4. **Printing Results**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Concatenation and Subarray Check**: The approach of concatenating the array with itself and checking for subarrays of length `n` that match the sorted array is a valid method to determine if the array can be split and swapped to form a non-decreasing order. This is because any valid split and swap operation can be represented as a subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or arrays that cannot be sorted by any split and swap operation. For example, the first test case in the problem description correctly returns 'No' because no valid split and swap can sort the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
- **Efficiency**: The code efficiently checks all possible splits by leveraging the concatenated array, ensuring that it covers all potential scenarios.

Since the program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases, it is considered correct.
