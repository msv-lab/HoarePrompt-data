The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `results` already contains one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a)`. After executing the code, `results` will now contain two elements: the original value returned by `func_1(a)` and the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the second being the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
