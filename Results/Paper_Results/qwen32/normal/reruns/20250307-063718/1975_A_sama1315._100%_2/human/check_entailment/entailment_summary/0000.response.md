### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The solution involves checking if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array.

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- The function takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`.
- The idea behind doubling the list is to account for all possible rotations of the array. By checking each possible subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list, we effectively check every possible rotation.
- If any such subsequence matches the sorted version of `a`, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
- It then calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to a list of results.
- Finally, it prints all the results, one per line.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to correctly solve the problem. Function 1 checks the necessary condition for the array to be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, and Function 2 handles input/output for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.
