Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`a`, `input`, `data`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only initializes `idx`.
