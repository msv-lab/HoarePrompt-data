### Reasoning:

The original assessment seems to have a logical flaw in the explanation of `func_1`. Let's break down the problem description and the provided solution again to identify any discrepancies.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if an array can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing order. The key operation is concatenating the array with itself and checking if any subarray of length `n` (the original array's length) matches the sorted version of the array.

#### Provided Solution:
- **`func_1(a)`**:
  1. Sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
  2. Concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
  3. Checks all possible subarrays of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if any match `sorted_a`.

#### Verification:
1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
   - The idea behind concatenating the array with itself is to capture all possible rotations of the array. If any subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it implies that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a sorted order.
   - This approach is theoretically sound because any valid split and swap operation can be represented as a subarray of the concatenated array.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, `sorted_a` will be the same as `a`, and the first subarray of `concatenated_a` will match `sorted_a`.
   - **Non-Sortable Array**: If no subarray of length `n` matches `sorted_a`, it correctly identifies that the array cannot be sorted by any split and swap operation.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **First Test Case**: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
     - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
     - Concatenated array: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
     - No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted version, so the function correctly returns 'No'.
   - **Second Test Case**: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
     - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
     - Concatenated array: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
     - Subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version, so the function correctly returns 'Yes'.
   - **Third Test Case**: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Concatenated array: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
     - First subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted version, so the function correctly returns 'Yes'.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be split and swapped into a non-decreasing order. The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

### Final: **True**
