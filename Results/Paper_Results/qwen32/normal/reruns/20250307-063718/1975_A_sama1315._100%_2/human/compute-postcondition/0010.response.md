The code increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Given that `idx` was initially 2, the new value of `idx` will be `2 + n`. The values of `a`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
