The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is `3 + 2*n`, the new value of `n` is derived from `data[3 + 2*n]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the second being the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
