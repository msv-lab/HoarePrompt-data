The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that does not affect the state of the loop directly. However, the loop runs `t` times, so we need to adjust `t` to reflect that one more iteration is about to start. The variable `t` is initialized as the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1, meaning it represents the number of remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of remaining iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, indicating that one iteration has been completed and there are still more iterations to go.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` should be decremented by 1.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted, and other variables like `a`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `results`, and `result` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the second being the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
