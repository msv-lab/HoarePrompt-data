To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`a`**: This is a list of `n` positive integers derived from a slice of `data` starting at `idx` and ending at `idx + n`.
2. **`input`**: This is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read`, which means it reads all the input from standard input.
3. **`data`**: This is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input. It is likely populated by splitting the input string by whitespace.
4. **`idx`**: This is calculated as `1 + t + (n1 + n2 + ... + nt)`, where `t` is the number of test cases processed so far, and `n1, n2, ..., nt` are the lengths of the lists for each test case.
5. **`t`**: This represents the number of test cases. Initially, it is set to 0.
6. **`results`**: This is a list that contains `t` elements, each being the value returned by `func_1(a)` for each test case.
7. **`n`**: This is the integer value of `data[1 + (n1 + n2 + ... + n(t-1))]`, which indicates the number of integers in the current test case.
8. **`result`**: This holds the value returned by `func_1(a)` in the last iteration.

### Code Snippet

The code snippet is:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation of the Print Statement

The `print` statement joins all the elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string. 

- **`results`**: This list contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each test case. Since `t` is the number of test cases, `results` will have `t` elements.
- Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1(a)` for a particular list `a` derived from the input data.

### Output Description

The output will be a series of results, one per line, where each result corresponds to the output of `func_1(a)` for each test case. The exact values depend on the function `func_1` and the input data, but the format of the output will be:

```
result1
result2
...
resultt
```

Where `result1, result2, ..., resultt` are the values returned by `func_1(a)` for each test case.

### Final Output

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the values returned by func_1(a) for each test case)**
