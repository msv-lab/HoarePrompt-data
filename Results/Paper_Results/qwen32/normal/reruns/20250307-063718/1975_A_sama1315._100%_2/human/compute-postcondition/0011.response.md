To determine the output state, we need to analyze how the provided code snippet affects the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
result = func_1(a)
```

Here, `func_1` is a function that takes the list `a` as an argument and returns some value, which is then assigned to the variable `result`.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` will hold whatever `func_1(a)` returns. The other variables (`a`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) will remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them (which it typically does not unless explicitly stated).

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
