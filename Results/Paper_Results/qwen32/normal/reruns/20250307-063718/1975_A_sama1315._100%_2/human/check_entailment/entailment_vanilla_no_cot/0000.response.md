Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **func_1(a)**: This function checks if the given array `a` can be rearranged into a sorted array by concatenating it with itself and checking if any slice of the concatenated array matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - It first calculates the length of the array `n`.
   - It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
   - It concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`).
   - It then iterates over all possible starting positions in the concatenated array, checking if any slice of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
   - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **func_2()**: This function handles input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` is sound because if the array can be split and rearranged to form a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated version of the array. The program correctly implements this logic and handles multiple test cases as required.
