Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
