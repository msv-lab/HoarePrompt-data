### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then the two parts are swapped. This is equivalent to checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution provided consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(a)`**: This function checks if the array `a` can be rotated to become sorted.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

##### Function `func_1(a)`:
1. **Sorting**: The function sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenation**: It concatenates `a` with itself to get `concatenated_a`.
3. **Checking for Rotation**: The function iterates over possible starting points of `sorted_a` in `concatenated_a`. If it finds a substring in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

##### Function `func_2()`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all input at once and processes it.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the array `a` and calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted.
3. **Output**: It collects all results and prints them at the end.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a` is not a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "No".

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - `concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

The logic in `func_1(a)` is sound. If `a` can be rotated to become sorted, then `sorted_a` must appear as a contiguous subarray in `concatenated_a`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **True**
