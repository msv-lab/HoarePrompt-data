### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them.

The provided program is structured to handle multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the input data.
   - Parses the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).
   - Calls `func_1` with the array `a` and collects the result.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes an array `a` and its length `n`.
   - Creates a sorted version of the array (`sorted_a`).
   - Concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a`).
   - Checks if any substring of `concatenated_a` of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
   - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

### Analysis:

The core idea behind the program is that if you concatenate the array with itself, any possible rotation of the array will appear as a contiguous subarray within this concatenated array. Therefore, if the sorted version of the array appears as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array, it means that the array can be rotated to become sorted.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Array: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Concatenated Array: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - The sorted array does not appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array, so the result is 'No'.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Array: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - Concatenated Array: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The sorted array appears as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array, so the result is 'Yes'.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Concatenated Array: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - The sorted array appears as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array, so the result is 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by rotating it. It efficiently checks all possible rotations by leveraging the concatenated array approach, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
