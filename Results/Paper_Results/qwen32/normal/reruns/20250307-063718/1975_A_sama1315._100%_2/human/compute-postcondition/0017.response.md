Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, so it becomes `3 + n + n` which simplifies to `3 + 2*n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
