The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was the number of iterations left, and now that one iteration has completed, `t` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
