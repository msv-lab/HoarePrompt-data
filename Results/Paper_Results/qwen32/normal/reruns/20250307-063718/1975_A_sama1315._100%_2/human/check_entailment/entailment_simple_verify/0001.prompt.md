You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix and then the two parts are swapped. The key insight here is that if the array can be rotated to become sorted, then it can be achieved by this operation.

### Solution Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function checks if the array `a` can be rotated to become sorted.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(a)`

1. **Sorting**: The function first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenation**: It then creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself.
3. **Checking for Rotation**: The function iterates over the possible starting points of `sorted_a` in `concatenated_a`. If it finds a substring in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

The logic here is sound because if `a` can be rotated to become sorted, then `sorted_a` must appear as a contiguous subarray in `concatenated_a`.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all input at once and processes it.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the array `a` and calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted.
3. **Output**: It collects all results and prints them at the end.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a` is not a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "No".

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - `concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
