To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix and then the two parts are swapped. The key insight here is that if the array can be rotated to become sorted, then it can be achieved by this operation.

### Solution Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function checks if the array `a` can be rotated to become sorted.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(a)`

1. **Sorting**: The function first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenation**: It then creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself.
3. **Checking for Rotation**: The function iterates over the possible starting points of `sorted_a` in `concatenated_a`. If it finds a substring in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

The logic here is sound because if `a` can be rotated to become sorted, then `sorted_a` must appear as a contiguous subarray in `concatenated_a`.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all input at once and processes it.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the array `a` and calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted.
3. **Output**: It collects all results and prints them at the end.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a` is not a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "No".

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - `concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
