Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    result = func_1(a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the second being the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` (reassigned); `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, all being the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
