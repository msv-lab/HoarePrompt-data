Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` (reassigned); `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the second being the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`

The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. 

Since `result` is already the value returned by `func_1(a)` and is the second element in the `results` list, appending `result` to `results` will make `results` a list with three elements: the first two being the value returned by `func_1(a)`, and the third being `result`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` (reassigned); `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, all being the value returned by `func_1(a)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
