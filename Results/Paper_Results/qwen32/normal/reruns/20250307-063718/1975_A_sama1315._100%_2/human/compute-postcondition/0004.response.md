Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Other variables (`a`, `input`, `data`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
