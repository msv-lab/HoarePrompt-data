The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are assigned to the variable `data`. This means that `data` will now contain the individual string elements from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input.**
