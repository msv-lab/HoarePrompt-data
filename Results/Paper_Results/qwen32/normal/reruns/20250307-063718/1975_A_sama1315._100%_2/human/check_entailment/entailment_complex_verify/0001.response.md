### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that if an array can be rotated to become sorted, then it can be achieved by the allowed operation of splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix. The logic implemented in `func_1` is sound and aligns with this insight. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting and Concatenation**:
   - The function sorts the array to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself. This doubling of the array allows us to check for any possible rotation of `a` that could result in a sorted array.

2. **Checking for Rotation**:
   - The function iterates over the possible starting points of `sorted_a` in `concatenated_a`. If it finds a substring in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
     - `sorted_a = [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
     - `concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
     - `sorted_a` is not a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "No".
   - **Test Case 2**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
     - `sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
     - `concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
     - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".
   - **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
     - `sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]`
     - `concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
     - `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`, so the result is "Yes".

These examples correctly demonstrate the logic and the program's behavior as expected. The annotations also support the reasoning, confirming that the program checks for the correct condition (whether `sorted_a` is a contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a`).

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis and verification, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines if the array can be rotated to become sorted, which aligns with the problem description.

**Final: True**
