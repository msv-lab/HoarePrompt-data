The variable `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx]`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 1, so `n` becomes the integer value of the string at index 1 of the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a positive integer from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `data[0]` must be a string representing a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
