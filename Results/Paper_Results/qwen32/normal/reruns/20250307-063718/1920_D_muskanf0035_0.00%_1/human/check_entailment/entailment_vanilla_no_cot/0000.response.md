Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation, which involves appending multiple copies of the current array to itself. Instead of appending multiple copies, the current implementation only appends a single copy of the array to itself in each iteration. This results in incorrect array construction for test cases where the second operation is used.

Here's a brief explanation of the issue:

- **Operation 1**: Correctly appends an integer to the end of the array.
- **Operation 2**: Incorrectly appends only one copy of the array to itself instead of appending `x` copies.

To fix this, the program should append `x` copies of the array to itself when `b=2`. This can be done by extending the array with itself `x` times. However, this naive approach can be inefficient due to the large possible size of `x` (up to \(10^9\)).

A more efficient approach would be to keep track of the size of the array after each operation and use this information to determine the correct element for each query without constructing the entire array. This would involve maintaining a list of segments, where each segment represents a part of the array that was appended at some point.

Here is a corrected version of the function that handles the operations more efficiently:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    segments = []
    current_size = 0
    
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            segments.append((current_size, current_size + 1))
            current_size += 1
        else:
            new_size = current_size * value
            segments.append((current_size, new_size))
            current_size = new_size
    
    def find_element(k):
        k -= 1
        for start, end in reversed(segments):
            if start <= k < end:
                if start == end - 1:
                    return array[k - start]
                k = (k - start) % (end - start)
    
    result = [find_element(k) for k in queries]
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

This version of the program keeps track of the segments and efficiently finds the element for each query without constructing the entire array.
