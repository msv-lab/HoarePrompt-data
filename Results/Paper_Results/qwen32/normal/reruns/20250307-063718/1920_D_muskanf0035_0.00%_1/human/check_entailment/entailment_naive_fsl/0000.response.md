Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation, which is to append x copies of the current array to the end of the array. The current implementation simply extends the array with itself, which is equivalent to appending only one copy of the current array, not x copies.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- **Operation Type 1**: The program correctly appends the integer x to the end of the array.
- **Operation Type 2**: The program incorrectly extends the array with itself only once, instead of x times. This means that for an operation of type 2 with x > 1, the array will not grow as expected.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
2 1
1 1
2 3
1
```

According to the problem description:
- After the first operation, the array should be `[1]`.
- After the second operation (appending 3 copies of the array), the array should be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- The query for the 1st element should return `1`.

However, the provided program will only append the array to itself once, resulting in the array `[1, 1]`, and the query for the 1st element will incorrectly return `1`, which is correct in this case, but the array itself is not `[1, 1, 1, 1]` as expected.

To fix this, the program should extend the array x times, which can be done using a loop or by multiplying the array by x.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Append x-1 copies of the current array
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This change ensures that the array is extended with x copies of itself, as required by the problem description.
