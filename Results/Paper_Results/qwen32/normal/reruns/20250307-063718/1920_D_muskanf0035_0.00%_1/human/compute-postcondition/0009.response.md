The provided code snippet reads `n` lists of integers from the input and assigns them to the variable `operations`. This means that the `operations` list will now contain `n` sublists, each containing integers.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `q`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `operations`, which now holds the newly read lists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**. The `operations` variable has been updated to contain `n` lists of integers read from the input.
