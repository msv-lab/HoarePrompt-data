The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q`. This means the initial values of `n` and `q` as input integers are now updated to the values read from the input. The other variables `operations` and `queries` remain unchanged, and `t` must still be greater than 1. The value of `result` remains the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
