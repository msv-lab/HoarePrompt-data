To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains integers read from input.
- `queries` is a list of integers read from input.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not directly used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- `result` has been returned from the function `func_1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*result)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*result)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print each element of the `result` list on the same line, separated by spaces.
- The exact values of `result` depend on the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is not provided in the initial state.
- Since we don't have the implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `result`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the `result` list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, which is the return value of the `func_1` function, separated by spaces.

### Output Format:
Output: **result (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
