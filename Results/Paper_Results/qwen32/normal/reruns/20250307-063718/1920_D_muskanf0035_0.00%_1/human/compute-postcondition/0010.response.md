The code snippet provided updates the `queries` list by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual string values, converting each string to an integer, and then mapping these integers into a list. This means that the `queries` list will now hold the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**

In natural language: The `queries` list has been updated to contain integers read from the input. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
