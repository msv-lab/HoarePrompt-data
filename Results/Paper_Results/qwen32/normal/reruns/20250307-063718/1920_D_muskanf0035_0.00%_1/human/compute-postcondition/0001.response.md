The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `_` for `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of lists, `queries` is a list of q integers, `t` must be greater than 0**
