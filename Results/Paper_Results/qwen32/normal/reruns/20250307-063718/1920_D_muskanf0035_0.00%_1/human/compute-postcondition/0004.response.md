The code snippet provided updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing them in a list. This means that the original `queries` list is replaced with a new list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0.**
