The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of lists, `queries` is a list of q integers, and `t` must be greater than 0. 

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `q` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`operations`, `queries`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of lists, `queries` is a list of q integers, `t` must be greater than 0.**
