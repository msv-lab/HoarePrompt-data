To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the function `func_1` on the given variables. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only infer that `result` will take the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact value of `result`. However, we can state that `result` is now assigned the return value of `func_1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the updated output state will include the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
