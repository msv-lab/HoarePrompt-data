n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple (b, x) represents an operation (b ∈ {1, 2}, if b=1 then 1 ≤ x ≤ n, if b=2 then 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and queries is a list of q integers (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) where each integer k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)) is a query, with c being the size of the array after all n operations. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.
