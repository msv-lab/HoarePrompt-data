n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.
