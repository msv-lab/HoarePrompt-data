To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to understand the context and how the `result` variable is derived from the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains integers read from input.
- `queries` is a list of integers read from input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces. However, the exact contents of `result` depend on the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is not provided in the initial state. 

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `result`. However, we can describe the output based on the information given.

Output: **result (where result is the list returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**

This means that the output will be the elements of the list `result`, which is the output of the function `func_1` given the inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot provide the exact numerical values, but we can describe the output in terms of the function's return value.
