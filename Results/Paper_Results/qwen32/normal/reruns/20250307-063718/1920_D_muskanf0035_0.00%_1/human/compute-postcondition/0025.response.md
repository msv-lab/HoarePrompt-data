Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing queries. The function processes the operations to modify an internal array and then answers each query by returning the result corresponding to the query index in the modified array.**
