Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` and `result` has been returned.**

Explanation: The variable `result` is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
