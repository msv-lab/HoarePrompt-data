The provided code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input is not related to the initial state variables `n`, `operations`, or `queries`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and `queries` is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations, `t` is an input integer.**
