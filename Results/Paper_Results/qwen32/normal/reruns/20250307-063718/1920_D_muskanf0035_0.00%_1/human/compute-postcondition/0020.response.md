Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations. `operations` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` (which can be either 1 or 2) and `x` (where `x` ranges from 1 to `n` if `b` is 1, and from 1 to 10^9 if `b` is 2). `queries` is a list of integers `k_i`, where each `k_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ min(10^18, `c`), with `c` being the size of the array after all operations. The function performs the operations specified in the `operations` list on an initially empty array and then returns the results of the queries, which ask for specific elements in the final array.**
