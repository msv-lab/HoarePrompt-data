n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1 and x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers representing the queries where each query is a positive integer k such that 1 <= k <= the size of the array after all operations.
