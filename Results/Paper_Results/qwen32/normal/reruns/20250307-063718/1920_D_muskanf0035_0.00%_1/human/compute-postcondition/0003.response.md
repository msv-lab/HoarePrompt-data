The provided code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line is split into integers and converted into a list. These lists are then collected into a larger list called `operations`. The variables `n`, `q`, `queries`, and `t` are not modified by this code snippet.

Given that `operations` was initially a list of lists, after the code snippet executes, `operations` will contain the newly read lists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of `q` integers, `t` must be greater than 0.**
