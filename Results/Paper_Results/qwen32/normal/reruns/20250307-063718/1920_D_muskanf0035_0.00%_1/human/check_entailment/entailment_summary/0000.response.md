### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior against the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To process a series of operations on an initially empty array and answer queries about the final state of the array.
   - **Operations**:
     - **Type 1 (b = 1)**: Appends an integer `x` to the end of the array.
     - **Type 2 (b = 2)**: Appends `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - **Queries**: For each query `k`, it returns the element at index `k-1` in the final array, using modulo arithmetic to handle indices larger than the array size.
   - **Issue**: The function `func_1` has a critical flaw in how it handles operation type 2. The current implementation of `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect because it does not append `x` copies of the array; it only appends one copy of the array. The correct implementation should be `array.extend(array * x)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results of the queries.
   - **Behavior**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries, processes the operations, and then answers the queries using `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue lies in the incorrect handling of operation type 2 in `func_1`. As a result, the final array is not constructed as per the problem description, leading to incorrect answers for the queries.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
