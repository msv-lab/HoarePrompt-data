Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n` is the number of operations, `q` is the number of queries, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from input, `queries` is a list of `q` queries read from input, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The final output consists of the results from all `t` iterations, each printed on a new line.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `t` iterations, the output will be the results of `func_1` for each set of operations and queries provided in each iteration, with each result printed on a separate line.
