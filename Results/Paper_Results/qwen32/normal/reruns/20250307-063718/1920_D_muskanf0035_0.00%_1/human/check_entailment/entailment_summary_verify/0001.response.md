Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Initialization**:
    - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array `a` as described in the problem statement.
    - It also initializes an empty list `result` to store the answers for the queries.

2. **Processing Operations**:
    - For each operation, it checks the type of operation (`op_type`).
    - If `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the end of `array`. This part is correct.
    - If `op_type` is 2, the program attempts to extend `array` by appending `value` copies of `array` to itself. However, the implementation `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect. This line only appends one copy of the current array to itself, not `value` copies. This is a significant error.

3. **Handling Queries**:
    - For each query `k`, the function calculates the element at the `k-1` index in the `array` using modulo operation to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array. This part is correct.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
    - It reads the operations and queries.
    - It calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries and prints the results.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect due to the erroneous handling of the second type of operation. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be replaced with a loop that appends `value` copies of the array to itself.

To correct the program, the implementation for the second type of operation should be modified as follows:
```python
if op_type == 2:
    array.extend(array for _ in range(value - 1))
```
This change ensures that `value` copies of the array are appended to the array, as required by the problem statement.

Since the current implementation does not correctly handle the second type of operation, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
