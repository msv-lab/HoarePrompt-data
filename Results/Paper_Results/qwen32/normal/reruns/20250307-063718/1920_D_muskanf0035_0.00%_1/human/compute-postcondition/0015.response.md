The provided code snippet reads `n` lists of integers into the `operations` list. Given the initial state, `n` is the first input integer, and `operations` is initially described as a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input. After executing the given code snippet, `operations` will be populated with these `n` lists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains the first input integer. The `operations` list is now populated with `n` lists of integers read from the input. The values of `q`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
