Reasoning: 

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` is the main function that reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. `func_1` performs the operations and handles the queries.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step:

1. **Operation Handling in `func_1`**:
   - For operation type 1 (appending an integer `x` to the array), the program correctly appends the integer to the array.
   - For operation type 2 (appending `x` copies of the array to the array), the program incorrectly extends the array by repeating the array `x` times. However, the way it is implemented, it only doubles the array each time (since `x` is not used to control the number of repetitions). This is incorrect as per the problem statement, which requires appending `x` copies of the array, not just doubling it.

2. **Query Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The program uses modulo operation to find the `k-th` element in the array, which is correct for cyclic arrays. However, due to the incorrect handling of operation type 2, the array does not grow as expected, and hence the queries may not yield the correct results.

3. **Main Function `func_2`**:
   - The main function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of operations and queries, and then calls `func_1` to get the results for the queries. It correctly prints the results for all test cases.

Given the incorrect handling of operation type 2 in `func_1`, the program does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
