You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1 and x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers representing the queries where each query is a positive integer k such that 1 <= k <= the size of the array after all operations.

    return result
    #The program returns result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of operations to build and modify an internal array. It then answers a series of queries by returning the elements from this array based on the query indices. Each operation either appends a value to the array or duplicates the entire array. Each query specifies an index, and the function returns the element at that index in the final array, using modulo arithmetic to handle indices larger than the array size.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())

        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n` is the number of operations, `q` is the number of queries, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from input, `queries` is a list of `q` queries read from input, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The final output consists of the results from all `t` iterations, each printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from input. For each test case, it processes a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answers a set of queries about the final state of the array. The operations can either involve modifying the array or adding elements to it, and the queries ask for specific elements in the array after all operations have been performed. The results of the queries are printed for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array `a` as described in the problem statement. It also initializes an empty list `result` to store the answers for the queries.

2. **Processing Operations**:
    - For each operation, it checks the type of operation (`op_type`).
    - If `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the end of `array`.
    - If `op_type` is 2, the program attempts to extend `array` by appending `value` copies of `array` to itself. However, the implementation `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect. It only appends one copy of the current array to itself, not `value` copies. This is a significant error.
    
3. **Handling Queries**:
    - For each query `k`, the function calculates the element at the `k-1` index in the `array` using modulo operation to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array. This part is correct.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
    - It reads the operations and queries.
    - It calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries and prints the results.

The critical issue lies in the incorrect handling of the second type of operation (appending `value` copies of the array). The current implementation only appends one copy of the array to itself, which is not what the problem statement requires.

To fix the program, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be replaced with a loop that appends `value` copies of the array to itself.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
