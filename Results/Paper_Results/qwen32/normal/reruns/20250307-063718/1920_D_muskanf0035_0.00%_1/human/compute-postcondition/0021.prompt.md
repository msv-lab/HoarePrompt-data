You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n` is the number of operations, `q` is the number of queries, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from input, `queries` is a list of `q` queries read from input, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The final output consists of the results from all `t` iterations, each printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations. `operations` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` (which can be either 1 or 2) and `x` (where `x` ranges from 1 to `n` if `b` is 1, and from 1 to 10^9 if `b` is 2). `queries` is a list of integers `k_i`, where each `k_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ min(10^18, `c`), with `c` being the size of the array after all operations. The function performs the operations specified in the `operations` list on an initially empty array and then returns the results of the queries, which ask for specific elements in the final array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
