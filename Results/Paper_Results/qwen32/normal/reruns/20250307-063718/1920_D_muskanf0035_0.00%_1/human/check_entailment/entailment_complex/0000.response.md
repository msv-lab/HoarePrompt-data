### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function is responsible for building the array based on the given operations and answering the queries.
- **Operations**:
  - If the operation type is `1`, it appends the integer `x` to the array.
  - If the operation type is `2`, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself.
- **Queries**:
  - For each query `k`, it returns the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This is to handle cases where `k` is larger than the array size by wrapping around using modulo arithmetic.

**Issues in `func_1`**:
- **Operation Type 2**: The current implementation of `func_1` for operation type `2` is incorrect. It should append `x` copies of the current array to itself, but the current implementation only appends one copy of the array to itself. This is a logical error.
- **State Comment**: The state comment at the end of `func_1` is incorrect as it does not match the actual state of the array after the loop.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Reading Input**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
  - It reads `n` operations and `q` queries.
  - It calls `func_1` with the operations and queries and prints the result.

**Issues in `func_2`**:
- **No Issues**: This function correctly reads the input and processes it using `func_1`. It prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in `func_1` where the implementation of operation type `2` is incorrect. The current implementation only appends one copy of the array to itself instead of `x` copies. Therefore, the final array constructed by `func_1` will not match the expected array after all operations, leading to incorrect query results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
