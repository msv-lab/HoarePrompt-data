The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. Since the underscore does not hold any state that we need to adjust, the state of the loop head does not change in a meaningful way.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop control variable `t` must be decremented by 1, because the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given that `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` should be decremented to a value that is still greater than 0.

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
