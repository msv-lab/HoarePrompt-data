The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `q` by reading them as integers from the input. The variable `n` is assigned the first input integer, and `q` is assigned the second input integer. The other variables (`operations`, `queries`, `t`, and `result`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
