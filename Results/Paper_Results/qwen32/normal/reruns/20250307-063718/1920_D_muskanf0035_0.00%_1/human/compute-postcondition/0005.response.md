To provide the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine exactly what it does or how it modifies the variables. However, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the given code snippet and typical programming practices.

Given the code snippet:
```python
result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
```

We know that:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input.
- `queries` is a list of integers read from input.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided snippet).

After executing the line `result = func_1(n, operations, queries)`, we can infer that `result` will hold the value returned by `func_1`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not typical in Python unless the function explicitly modifies mutable objects passed to it.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can state that `result` is assigned the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
