The code snippet provided updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, and converting each component to an integer. This means that `queries` will now hold a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**

In natural language: The `queries` variable has been updated to be a list of integers obtained from the latest input. All other variables remain unchanged.
