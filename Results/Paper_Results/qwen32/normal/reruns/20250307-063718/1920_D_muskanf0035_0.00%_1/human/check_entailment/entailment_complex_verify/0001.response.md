### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified a critical flaw in the implementation of the second type of operation. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Operation Type 1**: The program correctly appends the integer `x` to the end of the array. This part of the implementation is accurate according to the problem description.

2. **Operation Type 2**: The program incorrectly extends the array with itself only once. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`, which appends only one copy of the current array to itself. However, the problem requires appending `x` copies of the array, not just one.

   For example, if the array is `[1, 2]` and the operation is `2 3`, the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (appending 3 copies of `[1, 2]`). The current implementation would result in `[1, 2, 1, 2]` (appending only one copy).

3. **Query Handling**: The query handling part of the function is correct. It correctly uses modulo arithmetic to handle indices larger than the array size, ensuring that the queries are answered correctly based on the final state of the array.

### Annotations Review:

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code do not reflect the issue with the second type of operation. They only show the state of the array after operations and queries, without indicating the incorrect behavior of the second type of operation.

### Corrected Implementation:

The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the `func_1` function, which correctly appends `x` copies of the array:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Append x-1 copies of the current array
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This corrected implementation properly handles the second type of operation by extending the array with `x` copies of itself.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the second type of operation. Therefore, the final evaluation of the program's correctness is:

**Final: False**
