Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided Python program and the annotated version to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array `a` as described in the problem statement.
   - It also initializes an empty list `result` to store the answers for the queries.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, it checks the type of operation (`op_type`).
   - If `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the end of `array`.
   - If `op_type` is 2, the program uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to extend `array` by appending one copy of `array` to itself. This is incorrect because the problem statement requires appending `value` copies of `array` to itself, not just one copy.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query `k`, the function calculates the element at the `k-1` index in the `array` using modulo operation to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array. This part is correct.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries and prints the results.

The critical issue lies in the incorrect handling of the second type of operation (appending `value` copies of the array). The current implementation only appends one copy of the array to itself, which is not what the problem statement requires.

To fix the program, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be replaced with a loop that appends `value` copies of the array to itself.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Annotations:
- The annotations provided do not reflect the correct state of the array after the operations. For example, after the operations in the first test case, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` but the annotation shows `[3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4]`, which is incorrect.

Final: **False**
