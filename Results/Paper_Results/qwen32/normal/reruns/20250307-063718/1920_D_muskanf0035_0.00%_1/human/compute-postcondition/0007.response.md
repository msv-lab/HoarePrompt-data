The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute as long as the range `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `t` needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. After one iteration, `t` is effectively decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains integers read from input, `queries` is a list of integers read from input, `t` must be greater than 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
