The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from input. For each test case, it processes a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answers a set of queries about the final state of the array. The operations can either involve modifying the array or adding elements to it, and the queries ask for specific elements in the array after all operations have been performed. The results of the queries are printed for each test case.
