You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1 and x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers representing the queries where each query is a positive integer k such that 1 <= k <= the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:

    #State: [3, 4, 3, 3, 4]
    return result
    #The program returns result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of operations to build and modify an internal array. It then answers a series of queries by returning the elements from this array based on the query indices. Each operation either appends a value to the array or duplicates the entire array. Each query specifies an index, and the function returns the element at that index in the final array, using modulo arithmetic to handle indices larger than the array size.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n` is the number of operations, `q` is the number of queries, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from input, `queries` is a list of `q` queries read from input, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The final output consists of the results from all `t` iterations, each printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from input. For each test case, it processes a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answers a set of queries about the final state of the array. The operations can either involve modifying the array or adding elements to it, and the queries ask for specific elements in the array after all operations have been performed. The results of the queries are printed for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation, which is to append x copies of the current array to the end of the array. The current implementation simply extends the array with itself, which is equivalent to appending only one copy of the current array, not x copies.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- **Operation Type 1**: The program correctly appends the integer x to the end of the array.
- **Operation Type 2**: The program incorrectly extends the array with itself only once, instead of x times. This means that for an operation of type 2 with x > 1, the array will not grow as expected.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
2 1
1 1
2 3
1
```

According to the problem description:
- After the first operation, the array should be `[1]`.
- After the second operation (appending 3 copies of the array), the array should be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- The query for the 1st element should return `1`.

However, the provided program will only append the array to itself once, resulting in the array `[1, 1]`, and the query for the 1st element will incorrectly return `1`, which is correct in this case, but the array itself is not `[1, 1, 1, 1]` as expected.

To fix this, the program should extend the array x times, which can be done using a loop or by multiplying the array by x.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Append x-1 copies of the current array
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This change ensures that the array is extended with x copies of itself, as required by the problem description.
