To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given information and understand the roles of the variables and the function `func_1`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `q` is the second input integer.
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains integers read from input.
   - `queries` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it might be relevant in `func_1`).
   - `result` is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The return value of `func_1` is stored in `result`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*result)` is used to print the elements of `result` separated by spaces.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values that `result` will hold.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of what `func_1` returns.

Given that `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, the print statement will output the elements of `result` separated by spaces. The exact values depend on the implementation of `func_1`.

Output: **The elements of `result` (where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**
