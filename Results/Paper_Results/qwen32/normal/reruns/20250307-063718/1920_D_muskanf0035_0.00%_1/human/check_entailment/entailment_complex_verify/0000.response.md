### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Operations:**
  - **Type 1:** Append an integer `x` to the array.
  - **Type 2:** Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
- **Queries:** For each query `k`, return the `k`-th element of the final array.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at various points, indicating the expected behavior of the code.
- The annotations mention the states of the array and the results after processing operations and queries.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The program incorrectly handles operation type 2 by only appending the array to itself once instead of `x` times.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Operation Type 1:** The code correctly appends the integer `x` to the array.
2. **Operation Type 2:** The code uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` which effectively appends the array to itself only once. This is incorrect because it should append `x` copies of the array.

The problem with the code is that for an operation of type 2, the array should be extended by `x` times, not just once. The correct approach is to multiply the array by `x` and then extend it. The provided corrected version of the `func_1` function is:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Append x-1 copies of the current array
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This change ensures that the array is extended with `x` copies of itself, as required by the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle operation type 2, and the suggested correction fixes the issue.

**Final:** **False**
