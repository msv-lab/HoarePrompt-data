You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1 and x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers representing the queries where each query is a positive integer k such that 1 <= k <= the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: [3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4]
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: [3, 4, 3, 3, 4]
    return result
    #The program returns result
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing queries. The function processes the operations to modify an internal array and then answers each query by returning the result corresponding to the query index in the modified array.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns result


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
