### Reasoning:

The original assessment identifies a critical issue with the implementation of the second type of operation in `func_1`. Specifically, the program incorrectly extends the array with itself only once, instead of appending `x` copies as required by the problem description.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Operation Type 1**: The program correctly appends the integer `x` to the end of the array.
2. **Operation Type 2**: The program should append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. The current implementation uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, which is equivalent to appending the array to itself once. This is incorrect because it should append `x` copies, not just one.

The provided function summary for `func_2` is accurate in describing its role but does not highlight the specific issue in `func_1`.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails to handle the second type of operation properly. The suggested fix in the original assessment is also correct. The corrected version of `func_1` should be:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Append x-1 copies of the current array
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This modification correctly appends `x` copies of the array to itself, as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Given that the original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation and provides a valid fix, the assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The program as originally written is incorrect due to the issue with handling the second type of operation.
