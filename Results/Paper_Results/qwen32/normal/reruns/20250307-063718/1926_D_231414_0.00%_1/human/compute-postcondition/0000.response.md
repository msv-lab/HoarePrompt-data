`times` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
