To determine the state required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(times):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder for the loop variable, which is not used in the loop body, and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Given that `times` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `times` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
