The code assigns the value of \(2^{31} - 1\) to the variable `check`. The values of `t` and `times` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `check` is 2147483647.**
