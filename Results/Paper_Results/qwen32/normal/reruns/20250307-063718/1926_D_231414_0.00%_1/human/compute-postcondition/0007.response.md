The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`. The value assigned is `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is `2147483647`. This value is the same as the initial value of `check`, so the value of `check` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.**
