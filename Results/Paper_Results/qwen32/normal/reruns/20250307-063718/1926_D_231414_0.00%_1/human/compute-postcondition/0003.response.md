`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `times`, and `check` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer**.
