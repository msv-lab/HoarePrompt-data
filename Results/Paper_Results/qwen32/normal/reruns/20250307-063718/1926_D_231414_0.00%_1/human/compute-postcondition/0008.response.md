The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `data`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `data` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `times` is greater than 0
- `check` is 2147483647
- `n` is an input integer
- `data` is a list of integers from the input
- `dic` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is equal to `n`

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `data` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`**
