Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `s` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`. The current value of `dic[s]` is 0.**
