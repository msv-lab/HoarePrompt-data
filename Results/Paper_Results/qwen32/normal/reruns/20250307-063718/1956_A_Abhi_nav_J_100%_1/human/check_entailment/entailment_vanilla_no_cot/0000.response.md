Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the number of winners for each given number of players `n_i`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect and does not follow the rules of the game.

Here is a correct implementation of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for pos in a:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = [simulate_game(a, n_val) for n_val in n_values]
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This program correctly simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and iteratively removing players based on the positions specified in the sequence `a`. The function `simulate_game` returns the number of remaining players after the game ends, which are the winners.
