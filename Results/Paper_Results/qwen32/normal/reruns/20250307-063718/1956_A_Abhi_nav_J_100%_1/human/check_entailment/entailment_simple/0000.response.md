### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to simulate the game described in the problem statement and determine the number of winners for different values of `n_i`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required for the game.

Let's break down the correct logic needed for the game:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a list of players from 1 to `n_i`.
2. **Rounds**: In each round, remove the players at positions specified by the sequence `a` (if they exist).
3. **End Condition**: The game ends when no players are removed in a round.
4. **Output**: The number of players remaining after the game ends.

The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of winners for a given `n_i` and sequence `a`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks if `a` (the first element of the sequence `a`) is less than or equal to `b` (one of the values `n_i`) and returns `a - 1` or `b` based on that condition. This is completely incorrect for the problem at hand.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic, and the function `func_1` does not accurately compute the number of winners. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
