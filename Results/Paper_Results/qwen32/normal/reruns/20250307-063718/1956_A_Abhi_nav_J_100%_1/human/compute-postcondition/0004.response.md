Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of k strictly increasing integers between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of q integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. The function returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a` if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
