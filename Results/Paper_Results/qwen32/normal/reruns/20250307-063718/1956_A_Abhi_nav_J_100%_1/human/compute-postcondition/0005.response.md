Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of k strictly increasing integers between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of q integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, the function returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
