The provided code snippet attempts to return `a - 1`, where `a` is a list of integers. However, in Python, you cannot directly subtract an integer from a list using the `-` operator. This operation would result in a TypeError.

Given the context and the provided initial state, it seems like the intention might have been to subtract 1 from each element in the list `a`. If that's the case, the corrected code would be `[x - 1 for x in a]`.

Since the provided code will result in an error, we will assume the corrected version for the purpose of this task.

Assuming the corrected code `[x - 1 for x in a]`:
- We know that each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- Subtracting 1 from each element in `a` will result in a new list where each element is between 0 and 99.

Output State: **The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.**
