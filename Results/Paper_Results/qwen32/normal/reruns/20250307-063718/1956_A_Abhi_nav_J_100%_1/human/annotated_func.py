#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where 1 <= k <= 100, the integers in a are strictly increasing and satisfy 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each integer n_i in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of k strictly increasing integers between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of q integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, the function returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
