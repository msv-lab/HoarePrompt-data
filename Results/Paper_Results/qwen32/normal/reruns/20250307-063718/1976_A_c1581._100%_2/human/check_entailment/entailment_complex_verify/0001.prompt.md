You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; digits is a list containing all the digits from the password in the order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop completes all its iterations without returning False, meaning the last digit in `digits` is not greater than any letter in `letters`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(digits) - 1`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits appear before letters, both in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets this condition; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step and verify if it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - The function `func_1(password)` is called to check if the password is strong.
   - Inside `func_1`, it separates the digits and letters into two different lists.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant since the list is already sorted.
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
   - It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It checks if this newly constructed password matches the original password.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly check if all letters are in non-decreasing order. It only checks the first letter against the last digit.
- The check `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is redundant because the digits list is already sorted.
- The main logic flaw is in the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. This condition checks the last digit against every letter, which is incorrect. It should only check if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter.

### Corrected Approach:
- Separate digits and letters.
- Sort both lists.
- Check if the last digit (if any) is less than or equal to the first letter (if any).
- Ensure that the sorted digits followed by sorted letters match the original password.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    # Check if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter
    if digits and letters and digits[-1] > letters[0]:
        return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the condition to check the order of digits and letters. Therefore, it is not completely correct.
