Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for verifying strong passwords as per the problem description. Specifically, the code has a few issues:

1. **Digit-After-Letter Check**: The code does not correctly ensure that no digit comes after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is incorrect and does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

2. **Sorting and Merging**: The code sorts digits and letters separately and then checks if the concatenated sorted string matches the original password. However, it does not ensure that the letters and digits are in the correct order within their respective groups.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that:
- All letters in the password are in non-decreasing order.
- All digits in the password are in non-decreasing order.
- No digit appears after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    last_was_digit = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if last_was_digit:
                digits.append(char)
            else:
                # If we encounter a digit after a letter, the password is invalid
                return False
        else:
            # If we encounter a letter after a digit, the password is invalid
            if last_was_digit:
                return False
            letters.append(char)
        last_was_digit = char.isdigit()
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that:
- Digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
- No digit appears after a letter.

Thus, the original code is incorrect because it does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter and does not correctly check the order of digits and letters.
