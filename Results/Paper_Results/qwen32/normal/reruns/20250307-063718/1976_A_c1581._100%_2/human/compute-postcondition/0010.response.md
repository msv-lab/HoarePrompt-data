The code appends the current character `char` to the `letters` list. This means that `letters` will now include `char` as an additional element. Since `char` is a lowercase Latin letter (as per the precondition), the `digits` list remains unchanged and still contains only digits from the `password` string, if any.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. If the current character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If the current character `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char` and any previous lowercase Latin letters from `password`. `char` is the next character in the `password` string.**
