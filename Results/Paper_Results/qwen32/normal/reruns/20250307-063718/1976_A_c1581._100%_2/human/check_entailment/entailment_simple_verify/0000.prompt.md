You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; digits is a list containing all the digits from the password in the order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop completes all its iterations without returning False, meaning the last digit in `digits` is not greater than any letter in `letters`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(digits) - 1`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for verifying strong passwords as per the problem description. Specifically, the code has a few issues:

1. **Digit-After-Letter Check**: The code does not correctly ensure that no digit comes after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is incorrect and does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

2. **Sorting and Merging**: The code sorts digits and letters separately and then checks if the concatenated sorted string matches the original password. However, it does not ensure that the letters and digits are in the correct order within their respective groups.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that:
- All letters in the password are in non-decreasing order.
- All digits in the password are in non-decreasing order.
- No digit appears after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    last_was_digit = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if last_was_digit:
                digits.append(char)
            else:
                # If we encounter a digit after a letter, the password is invalid
                return False
        else:
            # If we encounter a letter after a digit, the password is invalid
            if last_was_digit:
                return False
            letters.append(char)
        last_was_digit = char.isdigit()
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that:
- Digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
- No digit appears after a letter.

Thus, the original code is incorrect because it does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter and does not correctly check the order of digits and letters.
