Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for checking if a digit comes after a letter is incorrect. The current implementation checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the intended condition. Instead, the program should ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the password.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sortedPassword = ''.join(letters + digits)  # Letters first, then digits
    # Check if the password is in the correct format
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version ensures that no digit comes after a letter and that both letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
