Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.**
