Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to verify if a password is strong based on Monocarp's criteria. However, there is a logical flaw in the `func_1` function that affects the correctness of the program.

The primary issue lies in the comparison `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. This condition is incorrect because it assumes that all letters should be greater than the last digit. However, according to the problem statement, the letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order and come after all digits, which are also sorted in non-decreasing order. The correct approach would be to ensure that all digits are sorted and come before any letters, and all letters are sorted.

Let's correct the logic:
1. Separate digits and letters.
2. Sort both groups.
3. Check if the sorted digits followed by sorted letters match the original password.

Here's the corrected part of the function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sorted_password = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sorted_password == password
```

Given the execution summary, it seems the original function incorrectly checks the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`, which leads to incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
