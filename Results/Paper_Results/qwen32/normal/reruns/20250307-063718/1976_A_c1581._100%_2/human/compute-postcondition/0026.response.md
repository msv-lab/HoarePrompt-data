To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case.

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit.
- `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order.
- Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`.
- Either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its value for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of `len(digits) - 1` if the loop has completed its last iteration. However, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be the value it had at the start of the last iteration plus one.

Let's assume that the loop has just finished the `k`-th iteration where `k` is the current value of `i`. To execute the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Given the constraints, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range of the `digits` list indices, i.e., `0 <= i < len(digits)`. Since we are moving to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`**.
