The `letters.sort()` operation sorts the `letters` list in ascending order. The `password` and `digits` lists remain unchanged. The `letters` list, which initially contained the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in the order they appeared, is now sorted alphabetically.

Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; digits is a sorted list containing all the digits from the password in the order they appear; letters is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order.**
