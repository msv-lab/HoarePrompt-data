Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; digits is a list containing all the digits from the password in the order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `digits` list will contain all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear. The `password` string remains unchanged.
