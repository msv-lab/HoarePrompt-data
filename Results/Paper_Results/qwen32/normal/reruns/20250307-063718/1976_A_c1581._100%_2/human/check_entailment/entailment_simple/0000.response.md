### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions:

1. **Digits and Letters Separation:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the password and separates them into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This is done implicitly by sorting the list and not finding any element that is greater than the next one.
   - The program also checks if the last digit in the `digits` list is not greater than any letter in the `letters` list. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.
   
4. **Reconstruction and Comparison:**
   - The program reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then compares this reconstructed password with the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted according to the rules, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue with the program is in the validation step. The current implementation checks if the last digit in the `digits` list is not greater than any letter in the `letters` list. However, this does not guarantee that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. Instead, it should check if the original password is already sorted in the required manner.

### Corrected Validation:

To correctly validate the password, we need to ensure that:
1. The digits are in non-decreasing order.
2. The letters are in non-decreasing order.
3. No digit appears after a letter in the original password.

The correct way to do this is to iterate through the password and ensure that:
- If a digit is found, no letter should appear after it.
- The digits and letters are individually in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Implementation:

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
        if i > 0 and password[i] < password[i - 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a password is strong. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
