Let's analyze the given program step by step and verify if it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - The function `func_1(password)` is called to check if the password is strong.
   - Inside `func_1`, it separates the digits and letters into two different lists.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant since the list is already sorted.
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
   - It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It checks if this newly constructed password matches the original password.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly check if all letters are in non-decreasing order. It only checks the first letter against the last digit.
- The check `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is redundant because the digits list is already sorted.
- The main logic flaw is in the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. This condition checks the last digit against every letter, which is incorrect. It should only check if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter.

### Corrected Approach:
- Separate digits and letters.
- Sort both lists.
- Check if the last digit (if any) is less than or equal to the first letter (if any).
- Ensure that the sorted digits followed by sorted letters match the original password.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    # Check if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter
    if digits and letters and digits[-1] > letters[0]:
        return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the condition to check the order of digits and letters. Therefore, it is not completely correct.

Correctness: **False**
