### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure the program is correct.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
3. It then calls a function `func_1(password)` to determine if the password is strong.
4. In `func_1(password)`, it separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
5. Both lists are sorted.
6. It checks if the last digit in the sorted `digits` list is greater than any letter in the sorted `letters` list. If so, it returns `False`.
7. It constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters`.
8. It compares `sortedPassword` with the original password. If they are the same, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Issues in the Program:**
1. The loop in `func_1` that checks if the last digit in `digits` is greater than any letter in `letters` has a logical flaw. The loop only checks if the last digit in `digits` is greater than the first letter in `letters` because of the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. This is incorrect because it should ensure that the last digit is not greater than any letter in `letters`.
2. The correct approach should be to ensure that there are no letters in the password after the first digit appears. This can be done by checking the order of characters in the original password.

**Corrected Approach:**
1. Iterate through the password and ensure that all digits appear before any letter.
2. While iterating, also check if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    for i in range(1, len(password)):
        if password[i].isalpha():
            seen_letter = True
        if seen_letter and password[i].isdigit():
            return False
        if i > 0 and password[i] < password[i-1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a password is strong. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
