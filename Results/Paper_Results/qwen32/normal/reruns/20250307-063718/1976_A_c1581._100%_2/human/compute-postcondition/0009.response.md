The code appends the current character `char` to the `digits` list. This means that if `char` was previously a digit, it will now be added to the `digits` list, making `digits` contain all previously collected digits along with `char`. The `letters` list remains unchanged as it only collects lowercase Latin letters, and `char` is not being added to it. The `password`, `n`, and the condition on `char` remain the same.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a list containing all previous digits and the current character `char`; `letters` is an empty list if `char` is a digit; `char` is the next character in the `password` string.**
