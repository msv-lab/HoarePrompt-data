Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing the lowercase Latin letter `char`; `char` is a lowercase Latin letter.**

In natural language: The `password` string remains unchanged. The `digits` list remains empty. The `letters` list now contains one element, which is the lowercase Latin letter stored in the `char` variable. The `char` variable still holds the same lowercase Latin letter value.
