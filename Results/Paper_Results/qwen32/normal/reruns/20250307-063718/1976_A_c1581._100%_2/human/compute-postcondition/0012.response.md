The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in the `password` string, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the next character in the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the next character in the `password` string. Since `char` is updated in each iteration to the next character in the `password`, we need to ensure that there is indeed a next character in the `password` string.

Given that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, and `char` is currently the last processed character, for the loop to continue, `char` must now represent the next unprocessed character in the `password`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `char` is now the next character in the `password` string.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. If the current character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing all previous digits and the current character `char`, and `letters` is an empty list. If the current character `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing all previous lowercase Latin letters and the current character `char`. `char` is the next character in the `password` string.** 

Since we are focusing only on the `char` variable and it is updated to the next character in each iteration, we can simply state that `char` is now the next character in the `password` string.

State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string.** 

However, to be more precise according to the loop's state, we should specify that `char` is now the next character in sequence from the previous `char` that was processed.

State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string after the previously processed `char`.**
