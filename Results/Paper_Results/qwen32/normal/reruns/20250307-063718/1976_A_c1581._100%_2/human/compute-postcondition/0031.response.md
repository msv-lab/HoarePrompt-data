To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `len(digits)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit.
- `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order.
- `i` is `i + 1`. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop variable `i` is incremented automatically by the `for` loop, we need to adjust `i` to be the value it will have at the start of the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented, so for the start of the next iteration, we need to set `i` to the next value it will take, which is the current value of `i` plus 1.

The only other variable in the loop head is `len(digits)`, but since the length of `digits` does not change during the loop, we do not need to adjust it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`**.
