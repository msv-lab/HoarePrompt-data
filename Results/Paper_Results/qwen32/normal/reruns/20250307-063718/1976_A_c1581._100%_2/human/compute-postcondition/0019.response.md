To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `len(digits)`.

The loop `for i in range(len(digits)):` will execute if `len(digits)` is greater than 0. This means that the list `digits` must contain at least one digit for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
- `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear.
- `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`, but since `i` is initialized by the `range` function, we don't need to adjust it directly. Instead, we need to ensure that `len(digits)` is greater than 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `digits` must contain at least one digit.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order.**
