The code snippet `digits.append(char)` appends the current value of `char` to the `digits` list. Given that `char` is described as "the next character in the `password` string after the previously processed `char`," the value of `char` will be added to the `digits` list, extending it by one element.

Output State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string after the previously processed `char`; `digits` is updated to include `char` as its last element.**
