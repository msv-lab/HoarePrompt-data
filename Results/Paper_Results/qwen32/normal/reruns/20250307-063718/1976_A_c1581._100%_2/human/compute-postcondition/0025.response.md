Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` in the order they appear and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in alphabetical order. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`.**
