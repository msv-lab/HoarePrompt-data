The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in the `password` string, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed character of the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in the `password` string. The `char` variable will be updated to the next character in the `password` string.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. If the current character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If the current character `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char`. `char` is the next character in the `password` string.**
