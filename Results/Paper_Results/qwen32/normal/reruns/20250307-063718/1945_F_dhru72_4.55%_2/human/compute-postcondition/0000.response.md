The provided code snippet only includes a type variable declaration:
```
T = TypeVar('T')
```
This line of code does not affect the values of `n`, `v`, or `p`. It simply declares a type variable named `T`, which is not used further in the given code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three parts: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000) representing the number of mushrooms, a list `v` of size `n` (1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
