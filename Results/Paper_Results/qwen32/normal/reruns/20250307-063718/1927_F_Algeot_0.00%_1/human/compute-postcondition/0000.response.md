The provided Python code snippet only sets the recursion limit for the Python interpreter. It does not modify any variables or take any input directly related to the initial state described. Therefore, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `w`, and any other variables related to the test cases remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function receives an input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The following m lines contain three integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and that the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The recursion limit for the Python interpreter is set to 10^6.**
