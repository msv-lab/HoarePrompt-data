The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`times`, `data`, and `dic`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`times` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is equal to `n`.**
