The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `times`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`times`), so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `check` is not relevant to the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`times` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1**
