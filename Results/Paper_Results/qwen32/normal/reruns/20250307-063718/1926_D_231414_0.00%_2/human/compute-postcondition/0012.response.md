Output State: **`times` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `dic` is a dictionary with `s` as a key and its value decreased by 1; `ans` is equal to `n - 1`; `check` is 2147483647; `s` is the result of `i ^ check`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that the value of `ans` is now `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
