Output State: **`times` is an integer representing the number of test cases, the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) representing the integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `times` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. All other conditions and constraints regarding the input format remain unchanged.
