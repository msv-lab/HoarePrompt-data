Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) representing the integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
