The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The variables `times` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`times` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
