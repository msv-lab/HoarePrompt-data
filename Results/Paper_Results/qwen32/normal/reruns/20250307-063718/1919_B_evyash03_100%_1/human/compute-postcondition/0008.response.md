The only variables in the loop head are `char` and `expression`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string and the current `char`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the current character being processed, and `expression` is the string of characters being iterated over.

To execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in the `expression` string. Since `char` is the last processed character, the next iteration will naturally take the next character from `expression` in the for loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the character that was just processed.
- For the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the `expression` string.
- `expression` remains the same as it is the entire string being iterated over.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters and has a length of at least 1, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string**.

Since `char` is the next character in the `expression` string, and `expression` remains unchanged, we don't need to modify `length` or any other variables outside the loop head.
