The code snippet calculates the value of `sub` by subtracting `count` from `length`. Given the initial state, `length` is the length of the string `expression` and `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`. After the execution, the value of `sub` will be `length - count`. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000, count is the number of '+' characters in the expression, sub is length - count.**
