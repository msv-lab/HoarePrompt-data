### Reasoning:

Upon analyzing the problem and the provided program, we need to determine whether the program correctly computes the minimum penalty for splitting the array into subarrays as described in the problem statement. 

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
2. **Processing the String**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the string `s` into subarrays.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for each subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the minimum penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then computing the absolute difference between the counts. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's re-evaluate the provided example cases to see why the given program might be incorrect:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1]`, and the only way to split it is `([1])` with a penalty of `1`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` with a penalty of `5`.
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++--`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program seems to give the correct output for the provided examples. However, the original assessment argues that the program does not follow an optimal algorithm to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty. 

Upon closer inspection, the program's approach of calculating the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters does not align with the problem's requirement to find the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The program does not consider different ways to split the array and calculate penalties for each possible split.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This does not reflect the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all possible inputs because it does not consider the optimal splitting strategy. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
