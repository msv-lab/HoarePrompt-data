Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` does not achieve this goal. Instead, it merely calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not correspond to the described penalty calculation process.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Incorrect Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates `count` as the number of '+' characters in the string. It then calculates `sub` as the number of '-' characters (`length - count`). Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count` (`abs(sub - count)`). This result does not represent the minimum penalty for any valid split of the array.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the program will calculate the number of '+' as 10 and the number of '-' as 10. The function will return `abs(10 - 10) = 0`. However, this does not necessarily represent the minimum penalty for the given input. The optimal split might involve different subarrays that yield a lower total penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach to solve this problem involves dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty. This would require evaluating different possible splits and calculating their penalties to find the minimum.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
