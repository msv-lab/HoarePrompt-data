The code snippet provided initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `expression` or `length`, which remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, and length is an integer representing the length of the string such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000; `count` is 0.**
