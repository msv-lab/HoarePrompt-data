Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The given code only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes the absolute difference between them, which does not align with the described algorithm for calculating penalties.

The correct approach involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is minimized (ideally zero) to minimize the penalty. The provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not related to the subarray penalties as required by the problem.

The example provided in the original assessment demonstrates the discrepancy: for the input `s = "+-+-+"`, the correct minimum penalty is 5, while the provided code incorrectly returns 1.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
