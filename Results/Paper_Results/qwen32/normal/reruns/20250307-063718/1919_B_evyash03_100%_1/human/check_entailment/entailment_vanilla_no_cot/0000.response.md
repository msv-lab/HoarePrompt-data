Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters, calculates the difference between them, and returns the absolute value of that difference. This approach does not take into account the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The given solution fails to consider the penalty calculation for each subarray and the optimal way to split the array.
