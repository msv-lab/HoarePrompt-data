### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
   - The penalty for a subarray `b_i` is defined as `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)`.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to form subarrays where the sum is zero because `|sum(b_i)|` will be zero, and thus the penalty will be zero.
   - If forming a subarray with a sum of zero is not possible, the strategy should aim to keep the absolute value of the sum as small as possible and the length of the subarray as small as possible.

3. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The provided code counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes the absolute difference between them. This does not account for splitting the array into subarrays or calculating penalties based on subarray sums.
   - The code does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays or calculate penalties correctly.

4. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the input `s = "+-+-+"` (length = 5).
   - The correct way to split this string to minimize the penalty is to split it into `["+","-","+","-","+"]`. Each subarray has a sum of 1 or -1, and the penalty for each subarray is `|1| * 1 = 1`. Thus, the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - The provided code would count 3 '+' and 2 '-', compute the absolute difference as `|3 - 2| = 1`, and return 1, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect.

**Final: False**
