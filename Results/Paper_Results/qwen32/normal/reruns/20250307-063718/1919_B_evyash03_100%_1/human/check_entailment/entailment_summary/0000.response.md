Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the minimum penalty by finding the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` as described in the problem statement. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into subarrays, calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and then summing these penalties. The program does not perform any splitting or consider the penalties for different possible splits. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
