To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes the entire `expression` string. The loop iterates over each character in `expression`. If the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable by 1. If the character is '-', the `count` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters.
- `length` is the length of the `expression` string, where `1 <= length <= 5000`.
- `count` is initialized to 0.

After all iterations, `count` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression` string. This is because the loop increments `count` by 1 for each '+' encountered and leaves `count` unchanged for each '-' encountered.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `expression` remains the same.
- `length` remains the same.
- `count` is the total number of '+' characters in the `expression` string.

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000, count is the number of '+' characters in the expression.**
