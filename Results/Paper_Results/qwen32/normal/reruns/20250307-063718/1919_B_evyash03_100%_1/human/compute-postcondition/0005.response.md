The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the iterable `expression`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string. If there are more characters in the `expression` string, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` holds the value of the last processed character in the `expression` string, and `length` is the total number of characters in the `expression` string. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should hold the value of the next character in the `expression` string.

To adjust the state for the start of the next iteration:
- `char` should be the next character in the `expression` string.
- `expression` remains the same as it is the iterable being looped over.

Since the problem does not specify the current position in the `expression` string, we can infer that the loop has processed `index` characters so far, where `index` ranges from 0 to `length - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, if `char` was the `index`-th character, then at the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the `(index + 1)`-th character.

However, since we do not have the specific value of `index`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the `expression` string.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters and has a length of at least 1, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string**
