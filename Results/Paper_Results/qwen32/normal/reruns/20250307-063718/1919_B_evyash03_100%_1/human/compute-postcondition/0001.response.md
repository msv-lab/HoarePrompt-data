To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `char` and the iterable `expression`.

The loop will execute if the `expression` string has at least one character since the loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`. The variable `char` will take on the value of each character in the string during each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters.
- `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`.
- `count` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `char`, but its value is determined by the `expression` string during each iteration. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `expression` has at least one character so that the loop can execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 1, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000, `count` is 0**. 

Since the problem specifies that `1 <= length <= 5000`, we can be assured that `expression` will always have at least one character, so no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. However, to explicitly state the requirement, we can say:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of only '+' and '-' characters and has a length of at least 1, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000, `count` is 0**.
