Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
2. **Processing the String**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the string `s` into subarrays.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for each subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the minimum penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then computing the absolute difference between the counts. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays. 

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the provided example cases to see why the given program is incorrect:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1]`, and the only way to split it is `([1])` with a penalty of `1`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` with a penalty of `5`.
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++--`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
Although the program seems to give the correct output for the provided examples, it does not follow an optimal algorithm to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not consider the optimal subarray splits.

Thus, the given program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
