### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program should find the optimal way to split the array to achieve this.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. This value is then returned as the result.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the given string `expression`.

#### Evaluation Using Function Summary:
The function summary indicates that `func_1` computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This computation does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the characters and returns their difference, which is not an optimal strategy for the problem.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's analyze the provided example cases to see why the given program is incorrect:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1]`, and the only way to split it is `([1])` with a penalty of `1`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct by coincidence, not by optimal strategy)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` with a penalty of `5`.
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct by coincidence, not by optimal strategy)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct by coincidence, not by optimal strategy)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++--`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct by coincidence, not by optimal strategy)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, and the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` with a penalty of `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct by coincidence, not by optimal strategy)

#### Conclusion:
While the program gives the correct output for the provided examples, it does not use an optimal algorithm to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not consider the optimal subarray splits.

Thus, the given program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
