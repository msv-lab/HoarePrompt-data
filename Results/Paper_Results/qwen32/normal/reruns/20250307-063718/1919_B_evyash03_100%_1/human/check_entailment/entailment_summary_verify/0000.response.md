Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The given code only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes the absolute difference between them, which does not align with the described algorithm for calculating penalties.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves forming subarrays where the sum is zero, as this results in a penalty of zero for each subarray. If forming a subarray with a sum of zero is not possible, we should aim to keep the absolute value of the sum as small as possible and the length of the subarray as small as possible.

The provided code does not implement any logic to achieve this. It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes their absolute difference, which is not the correct approach.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `s = "+-+-+"` (length = 5).
- The correct way to split this string to minimize penalty is to split it into `["+","-","+","-","+"]`. Each subarray has a sum of 1 or -1, and the penalty for each subarray is `|1| * 1 = 1`. Thus, the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
- The provided code would count 3 '+' and 2 '-', compute the absolute difference as `|3 - 2| = 1`, and return 1, which is incorrect.

Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, it is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
