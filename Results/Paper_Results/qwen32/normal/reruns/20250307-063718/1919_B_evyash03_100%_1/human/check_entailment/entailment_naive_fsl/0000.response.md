Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The given code only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes the absolute difference between them, which does not align with the described algorithm for calculating penalties.

Let's analyze the logic required by the problem and compare it with the provided solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Convert the string `s` to an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.
   - Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
   - The penalty for a subarray `b_i` is `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)`.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to form subarrays where the sum is zero because `|sum(b_i)|` will be zero, and thus the penalty will be zero.
   - If forming a subarray with a sum of zero is not possible, we should aim to keep the absolute value of the sum as small as possible and the length of the subarray as small as possible.

3. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The provided code simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and computes the absolute difference between them. This does not account for splitting the array into subarrays or calculating penalties based on subarray sums.
   - The code does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays or calculate penalties correctly.

4. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the input `s = "+-+-+"` (length = 5).
   - The correct way to split this string to minimize penalty is to split it into `["+","-","+","-","+"]`. Each subarray has a sum of 1 or -1, and the penalty for each subarray is `|1| * 1 = 1`. Thus, the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - The provided code would count 3 '+' and 2 '-', compute the absolute difference as `|3 - 2| = 1`, and return 1, which is incorrect.

Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect.
