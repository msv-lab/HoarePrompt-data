Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray. The total penalty is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays.

The provided function `func_1` only calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string. It does not consider any splitting of the array or the calculation of penalties for subarrays. This approach does not address the core requirement of the problem, which involves finding an optimal partitioning strategy to minimize the total penalty.

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or another suitable algorithm should be used to explore different ways of splitting the array and calculate the penalties to find the minimum possible total penalty.

Correctness: **False**
