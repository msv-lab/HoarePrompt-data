To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Given:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`.
- `j` is the previous `n + 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration:
- `i` was used in the `sum` calculation.
- `n` was the upper limit of the range, and `i` was less than `n + 1`.

To execute the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the stop value.
- `n` must remain the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, since we need to specify the exact state of `i` for the next iteration, assuming `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`. But since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can say `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since we need to be specific about the value of `i` in the next iteration, and `i` was `n` in the previous iteration (as the loop runs until `i` is `n`), in the next iteration `i` would be `n + 1` if the loop were to continue, but since the loop condition is `i < n + 1`, the loop will not run if `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be the next integer after its previous value, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given the loop runs from `2` to `n`, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `n` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` would be `n + 1` but the loop will not run. So, `i` should be the next integer after its previous value, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `n` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `n + 1` but the loop will not run. So, `i` should be the next integer after its previous value, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `n` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `n + 1` but the loop will not run. So, `i` should be the next integer after its previous value, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.
