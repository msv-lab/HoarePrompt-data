To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether the program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the operations as described in the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. Sum Calculation

The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the following formula:

\[
\text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
\text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
\]

\[
\text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
\]

Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Thus,

\[
\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
\]
\[
\sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
\]

Substituting these into the sum formula:

\[
\text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\text{sum} = 1 + \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
\]
\[
\text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{3n(n+1)}{6} + 1
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 6n(n+1) + 6}{6}
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 6n(n+1) + 6}{6}
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 6n(n+1) + 6}{6}
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 6n(n+1) + 6}{6}
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-2) + 6}{6}
\]
\[
\text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n-1) + 3}{3}
\]

This matches the expected maximum sum for the matrix. Therefore, the sum calculation is correct.

#### 2. Operations

The program performs `2n` operations as described:

- For each `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs:
  - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
  - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

These operations ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations fill the matrix in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

### Verification

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The derived formula for the sum is correct and matches the expected maximum sum.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2n` operations as required.
   - Each operation is valid as it involves a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Matrix Construction:**
   - The operations ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The operations fill the matrix in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
