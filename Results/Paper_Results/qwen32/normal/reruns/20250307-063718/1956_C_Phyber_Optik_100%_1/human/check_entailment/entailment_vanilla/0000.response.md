To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and check if it adheres to the problem requirements and constraints.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.
   - The formula used for the sum is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Let's simplify the sum:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 6n(n+1) + 6}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-2) + 6}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n-1) + 3}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n-1) + 3}{3}
     \]
     This formula is consistent with the sum of the first `n` squares and the first `n` natural numbers.

3. **Operations Calculation:**
   - The program outputs `2n` operations.
   - For each `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
     - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Verification

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The derived formula for the sum is correct and matches the expected maximum sum.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2n` operations as required.
   - Each operation is valid as it involves a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Matrix Construction:**
   - The operations ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The operations fill the matrix in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
