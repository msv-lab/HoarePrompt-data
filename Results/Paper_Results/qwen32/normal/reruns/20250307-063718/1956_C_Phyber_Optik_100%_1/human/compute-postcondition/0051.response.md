The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has already finished executing.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what would allow the loop to execute again. Since `i` is currently `n + 1` and the loop condition is `i in range(2, n + 1)`, the loop cannot execute again with the current state.

However, if we want to simulate the state right before the loop ends, we need to consider the last valid iteration. In the last valid iteration, `i` would be `n` and the loop would be about to increment `i` to `n + 1`.

Thus, to represent the state right before the loop ends (which is the state at the start of the last iteration of the loop), we need to set `i` to `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is 1 + 2(2i^2 - i), `j` is \(n + 1\), `i` is \(n\)**
