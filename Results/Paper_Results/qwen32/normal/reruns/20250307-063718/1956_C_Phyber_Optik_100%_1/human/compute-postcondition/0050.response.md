The given code snippet modifies the value of `sum` based on the current values of `i` and `n`. The variables `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Here's the calculation:

The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) * i`, which further simplifies to `(2i - 1) * i`, or `2i^2 - i`.

Given that `sum` was initially `1 + (2i^2 - i)`, the new value of `sum` after the operation will be:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + (2i^2 - i) + (2i^2 - i) = 1 + 2(2i^2 - i) \]

So, the updated value of `sum` is `1 + 2(2i^2 - i)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is 1 + 2(2i^2 - i), `j` is \(n + 1\), `i` is \(n + 1\)**.
