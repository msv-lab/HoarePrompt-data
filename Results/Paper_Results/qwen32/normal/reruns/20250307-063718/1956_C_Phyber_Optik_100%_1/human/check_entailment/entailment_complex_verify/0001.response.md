### Reasoning

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze both the sum calculation and the operations performed by the program to ensure they adhere to the problem requirements and constraints.

#### Sum Calculation

The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \]

Let's simplify this formula step-by-step:

\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \cdot i \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \]

Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]

We can rewrite the sums starting from 2:
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - 1^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \]
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \]

Substituting these into the sum formula:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right) \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \]
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6} \]
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+2 - 3)}{6} \]
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \]

This formula, however, does not match the expected maximum sum for the matrix. The expected maximum sum can be derived differently, considering that each row and each column can be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The optimal strategy is to fill the matrix such that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is essentially filling the matrix with a Latin square. The maximum sum in this case is:
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \times n = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \]

The program's sum calculation is incorrect.

#### Operations

The program performs `2n` operations:
- For each `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs two operations:
  - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
  - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

While the operations are valid and within the constraint of `2n` operations, they do not necessarily fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations described do not ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is required to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion

The program's sum calculation is incorrect, and the operations do not ensure the maximum sum is achieved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
