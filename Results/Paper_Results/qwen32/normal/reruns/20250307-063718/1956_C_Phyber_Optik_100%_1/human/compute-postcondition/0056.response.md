Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is \( n + 1 \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - This is a constant value `1` and will be printed as is.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `j` is defined as \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to:
     \[
     n - (n + 1) + 1 = n - n - 1 + 1 = 0
     \]
   - So, the second argument is `0`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, 6)` will produce the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output:
Combining the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- `1` (first argument),
- `0` (second argument),
- followed by the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, the output will be:
```
1 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
Output: **1 0 1 2 3 ... n (where n is at least 1)**
