The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `sum` is 93; `i` is 5**
