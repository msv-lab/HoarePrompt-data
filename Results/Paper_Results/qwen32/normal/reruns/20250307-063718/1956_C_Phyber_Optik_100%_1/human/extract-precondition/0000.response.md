Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), which represents the size of the n × n matrix a. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.**
