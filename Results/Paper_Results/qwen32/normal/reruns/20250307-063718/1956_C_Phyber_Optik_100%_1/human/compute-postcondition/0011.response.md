To determine the output of the `print(sum, n + n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the provided formula step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sum` is calculated using the formula: \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\).

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is an integer input. Its exact value is not provided, but we know it is an integer.

2. **Variable `sum`**:
   - The value of `sum` is calculated using the formula: \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\).
   - Let's break this down:
     - First, compute \(n(n+1)/2\), which is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers.
     - Square the result.
     - Subtract 1 from the squared result.

3. **Expression `n + n`**:
   - This expression simply doubles the value of `n`, so `n + n` is equivalent to `2 * n`.

### Output:
The `print(sum, n + n)` statement will output the value of `sum` followed by the value of `2 * n`.

Given the formula for `sum` and the expression for `n + n`, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **\((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1, 2 * n\) (where \(n\) is the input integer)**
