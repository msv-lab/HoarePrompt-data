The code snippet `n = int(input())` will update the value of `n` to a new input integer provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `sum`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `t` has already been decremented by 1, `sum` is calculated as \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\), and `j` is \(n + 1\). After the new input for `n`, `sum` and `j` will still be based on the previous value of `n` because they are not recalculated in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1; `n` is a new input integer; `sum` is \((\text{previous } n(\text{previous } n+1)/2)^2 - 1\); `j` is \(\text{previous } n + 1\)**.
