The provided code snippet modifies the variable `sum` by adding a calculated value to it. The value being added is `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. This expression simplifies to `i * i * i`, because `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `i * i - (i * i - 2 * i + 1)`, which further simplifies to `2 * i - 1`, but when multiplied by `i`, it becomes `i * i * i`.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `sum` is updated to its previous value plus `i * i * i`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * i * i`, `j` is the previous `n + 1`.**
