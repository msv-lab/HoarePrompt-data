To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop, but `sum` is not used in the print statement.
- `j` is set to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `2`: This is a constant value and will be printed as `2`.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given that `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n - 1`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks the range and prints each number separated by a space.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
- The number `2`.
- The number `n - 1`.
- The numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

So, the final output format is:
Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**

To provide a concrete example, if `n` is 5:
- `n - 1` would be `4`.
- The range from `1` to `5` inclusive would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Thus, the output would be:
Output: **2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**

However, since `n` is not specified in the initial state, we must keep the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
