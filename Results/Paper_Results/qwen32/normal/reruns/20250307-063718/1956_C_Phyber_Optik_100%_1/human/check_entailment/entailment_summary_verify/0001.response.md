### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows and columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula is consistent with the sum of the first \( n \) squares and the first \( n \) natural numbers.

3. **Operations Calculation:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
     - Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

#### Verification:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The derived formula for the sum is correct and matches the expected maximum sum.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations as required.
   - Each operation is valid as it involves a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Matrix Construction:**
   - The operations ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The operations fill the matrix in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
