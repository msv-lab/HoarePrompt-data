The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
