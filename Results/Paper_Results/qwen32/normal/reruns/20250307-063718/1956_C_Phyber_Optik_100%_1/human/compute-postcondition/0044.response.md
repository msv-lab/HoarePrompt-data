The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used in Python when the loop variable is not needed), it doesn't affect the loop condition. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Here's the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is a new input integer, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `j` is n + 1**
