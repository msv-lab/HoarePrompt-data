To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `j` is initialized to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument**: `1`
   - This is a constant value `1` that will be printed as the first element.

2. **Second Argument**: `n - j + 1`
   - Given that `j` is initialized to `1`, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is just `n`.
   - Therefore, the second element printed will be `n`.

3. **Third Argument**: `*range(1, n + 1)`
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - This means the third part of the print statement will output the numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Combining all the parts, the `print` statement will output:
- The constant `1`
- Followed by the value of `n`
- Followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`

### Example:
If `n` were `5`, the output would be:
- `1` (first argument)
- `5` (second argument, `n - j + 1` where `j` is `1`)
- `1 2 3 4 5` (third argument, unpacked range from `1` to `5`)

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
