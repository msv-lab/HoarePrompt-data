The code snippet provided modifies the value of `sum` by adding to it the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Let's break down the expression:

- `i * i` is the square of `i`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is the square of `i - 1`.
- The difference between these two squares is `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * i - 1`.
- Multiplying this result by `i` gives `(2 * i - 1) * i`.

So, `sum` is incremented by `(2 * i - 1) * i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` must be at least `i + 1`.

The only variable that gets updated here is `sum`. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be at least `i + 1`, `sum` is incremented by `(2 * i - 1) * i`.**
