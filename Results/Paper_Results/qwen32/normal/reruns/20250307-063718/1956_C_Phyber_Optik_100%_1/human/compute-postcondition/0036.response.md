To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1. (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.)
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\). (This variable is also not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.)

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**: This is a constant value `2` that will be printed directly.
2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**: This value depends on `n` and `j`. Since `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n - j + 1`. However, we can describe it as `n - j + 1` where `j` is some integer.
3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**: This will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n` is 5, it will print `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output `2`, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, n - j + 1, 1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and j is some integer)**
