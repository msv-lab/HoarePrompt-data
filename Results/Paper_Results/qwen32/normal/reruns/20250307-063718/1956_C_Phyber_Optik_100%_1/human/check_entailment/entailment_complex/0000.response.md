### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either modify a row or a column with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum and prints the operations required to achieve this sum. Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each row and each column can be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum sum is achieved when each number from 1 to \( n \) appears in each row and each column exactly once.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, each consisting of either modifying a row or a column with a permutation.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - A Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations described ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears in each row and each column exactly once.
   - The first operation fills the row with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The second operation fills the column with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - By performing these operations in a specific order, the matrix is filled in such a way that the sum of all elements is maximized.

4. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
