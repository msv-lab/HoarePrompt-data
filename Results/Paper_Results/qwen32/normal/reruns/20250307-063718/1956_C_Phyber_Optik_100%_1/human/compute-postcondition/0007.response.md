Let's calculate the impact of the given Python code on the program:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `sum` is 1 + i^3.
- `i` is 4.

Code snippet:
```python
sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

First, let's calculate the value of `sum` before the modification:
- `sum` is initially `1 + i^3`. Given `i` is 4, `sum` is `1 + 4^3` which equals `1 + 64` or `65`.

Now, let's compute the value to be added to `sum`:
- `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`
- Substituting `i` with 4, we get `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4`
- This simplifies to `(16 - 3 * 3) * 4`
- Further simplifying, we get `(16 - 9) * 4` which equals `7 * 4` or `28`.

Adding this value to the existing `sum`:
- `sum` becomes `65 + 28` which equals `93`.

The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` remains `4`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `sum` is 93; `i` is 4.**
