Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective:** Maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeroes.
- **Operations:**
  1. **Type 1:** Choose a row i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[i,j] = p[j]` for all j.
  2. **Type 2:** Choose a column i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[j,i] = p[j]` for all j.
- **Constraints:** No more than 2n operations.
- **Output:** The maximum sum and the operations used to achieve this sum.

### Given Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum sum and prints the operations.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   sum = 1
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
   ```
   - This loop iterates from 2 to n, adding the contribution of each row/column to the sum. The formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` calculates the sum of the first i natural numbers, which is the sum of the permutation [1, 2, ..., i] repeated i times.

2. **Operations Output:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + n)
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
       print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, each consisting of a Type 1 and a Type 2 operation on rows and columns respectively, using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Verification Against Problem Description
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculation seems correct as it follows the logic of maximizing the sum by filling the matrix with the highest possible values using permutations.
  - For example, for `n = 2`, the sum should be `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 6 = 7`, which matches the example output.

- **Operations Output:**
  - The program outputs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
  - The operations are valid as they use permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] and apply them to rows and columns.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the program, it seems that it correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required operations according to the problem description. The program handles the edge cases (e.g., `n = 1`) and general cases (e.g., `n = 2`) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum by considering the contribution of each row/column filled with the highest possible values using permutations. It also outputs the required operations within the limit of `2n` operations, ensuring that the matrix is filled optimally.
