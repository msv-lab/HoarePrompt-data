### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an `n × n` matrix `a` using no more than `2n` operations.
2. **Operations**:
   - Type 1: Choose a row `i` and a permutation `p` of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Set `a_{i, j} = p_j` for all `j`.
   - Type 2: Choose a column `i` and a permutation `p` of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Set `a_{j, i} = p_j` for all `j`.
3. **Output**:
   - The maximum sum `s` and the number of operations `m` (where `m ≤ 2n`).
   - The sequence of operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum as follows:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - This loop can be simplified. The term `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `2i - 1`. So, the loop is essentially:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (2 * i - 1) * i
     ```
   - This simplifies further to:
     ```python
     sum = sum(i * (2 * i - 1) for i in range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This formula calculates the sum of the series `1 + 3*2 + 5*3 + ... + (2n-1)*n`, which is the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `2n` operations, each of which is a combination of a row and a column operation with a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The operations are structured as:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + 1):
         print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
         print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in a way that maximizes the sum.

#### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The calculated sum is indeed the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
- **Operations**: The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled appropriately, leading to the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
