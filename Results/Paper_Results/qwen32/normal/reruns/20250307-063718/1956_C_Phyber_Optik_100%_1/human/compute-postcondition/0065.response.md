To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the overall effect of the loop given the initial state and the pattern observed in the first three iterations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, `n` is an input integer, and the inner loop calculates a `sum` and prints specific patterns.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The `sum` is calculated using a nested loop that iterates from `2` to `n`, adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the `sum` in each iteration. This simplifies to `sum += i^3`.
4. **Printing**: For each test case, the code prints `sum` followed by `n + n`, and then prints two lines for each `j` from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the output state will be determined by the final values of `t`, `n`, `sum`, and `j` in the context of the last iteration. The variable `t` will be `0` because the loop will have run `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration. The variable `n`, `sum`, and `j` will reflect the values from the last test case.

### Calculation of `sum`:
For the last test case, `sum` is calculated as the sum of cubes from `1` to `n`, which is \(\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2\).

### Output State:
- `t` will be `0` because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` will be the value of `n` from the last test case.
- `sum` will be \(\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2\) for the last test case.
- `j` will be `n + 1` after the inner loop completes for the last test case.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **t is 0; n is the last input integer; sum is (n(n + 1)/2)^2 for the last test case; j is n + 1.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `t` will be `0`, `n` will be the value of `n` from the final test case, `sum` will be the sum of cubes from `1` to `n` for the final test case, and `j` will be `n + 1`.
