To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on a loop (the loop itself is not provided in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value).
- `j` is \(n + 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `sum`**:
   - The value of `sum` is not explicitly provided, and it is mentioned that it is calculated based on a loop. Since the loop is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `sum`. However, we know that `sum` is a variable that holds some calculated value.

2. **Expression `n + n`**:
   - This expression simplifies to `2 * n`. Given that `n` is an input integer, `n + n` will be twice the value of `n`.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` followed by the value of `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
Since we don't have the exact value of `sum`, we will describe it as a variable holding some calculated value based on the loop.

Output: **sum (where sum is the calculated sum based on the loop), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
