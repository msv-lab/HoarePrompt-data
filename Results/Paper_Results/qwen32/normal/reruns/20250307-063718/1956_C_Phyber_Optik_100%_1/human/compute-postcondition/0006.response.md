The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the previous iteration incremented `i` from 2), and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must remain at least 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

The state of `sum` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `sum` is 1 + i^3; `i` is 4**
