To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we first need to understand how the loop operates and how many times it will run.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This loop will run `n` times because the range function `range(1, n + 1)` generates `n` values starting from 1 up to `n`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, it's clear that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute 3 times. 

After `n` iterations, the value of `j` in the loop head will be `n + 1` because the loop variable `j` will have gone through all values from 1 to `n` and will be incremented to `n + 1` after the last iteration.

Since the loop does not modify `t` or `sum` directly, these values will remain unchanged. The variable `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final output state after all the iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is the input integer, `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop, `j` is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `n` times, and after it finishes, the variable `j` will be `n + 1`, while `t` and `sum` will remain as they were initially.
