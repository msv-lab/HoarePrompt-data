Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to understand the output.

### Initial State
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0. (This value is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is calculated as \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\). (This value is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
- `j` is 3.

### Print Statement
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Breakdown of the Print Statement
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant value and will always be `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given that `j` is 3, this argument becomes `n - 3 + 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`.
   - So, the value printed will be `n - 2`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual arguments.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, this will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output
Given the above breakdown, the output will be:
- The first number is `2`.
- The second number is `n - 2`.
- The subsequent numbers are the sequence from `1` to `n`.

Thus, the output can be described as:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer and must be at least 1)**
