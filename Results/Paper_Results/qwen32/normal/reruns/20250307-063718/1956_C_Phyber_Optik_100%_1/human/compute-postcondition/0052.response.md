The code snippet modifies the `sum` variable by adding to it the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Given the initial conditions, we need to compute the new value of `sum`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `i * i` is the square of `i`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is the square of `i - 1`.
- The difference `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` simplifies to `2i - 1` (since \(i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1\)).
- Therefore, the expression becomes `(2i - 1) * i`.

The new value of `sum` is the old value of `sum` plus `(2i - 1) * i`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is `1 + 2(2i^2 - i) + (2i - 1) * i`, `j` is \(n + 1\), `i` is \(n\)**.
