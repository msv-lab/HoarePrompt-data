Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the current task.)
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the current task.)
- `j` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - This is a constant value `1`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - Since `j` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is just `n`.
   - Therefore, the second value printed is `n`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 6)`, which generates the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

### Putting It All Together:
- The `print` statement will output the following:
  - The first value is `1`.
  - The second value is `n`.
  - The third value onwards are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
- If `n` is 5, the output will be `1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
- If `n` is 3, the output will be `1, 3, 1, 2, 3`.
- In general, the output will be `1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
