You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective:** Maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeroes.
- **Operations:**
  1. **Type 1:** Choose a row i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[i,j] = p[j]` for all j.
  2. **Type 2:** Choose a column i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[j,i] = p[j]` for all j.
- **Constraints:** No more than 2n operations.
- **Output:** The maximum sum and the operations used to achieve this sum.

### Given Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum sum and prints the operations.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   sum = 1
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
   ```
   - This loop iterates from 2 to n, adding the contribution of each row/column to the sum. The formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` calculates the sum of the first i natural numbers, which is the sum of the permutation [1, 2, ..., i] repeated i times.

2. **Operations Output:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + n)
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
       print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, each consisting of a Type 1 and a Type 2 operation on rows and columns respectively, using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Verification Against Problem Description
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculation seems correct as it follows the logic of maximizing the sum by filling the matrix with the highest possible values using permutations.
  - For example, for `n = 2`, the sum should be `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 6 = 7`, which matches the example output.

- **Operations Output:**
  - The program outputs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
  - The operations are valid as they use permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] and apply them to rows and columns.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the program, it seems that it correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required operations according to the problem description. The program handles the edge cases (e.g., `n = 1`) and general cases (e.g., `n = 2`) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum by considering the contribution of each row/column filled with the highest possible values using permutations. It also outputs the required operations within the limit of `2n` operations, ensuring that the matrix is filled optimally.
