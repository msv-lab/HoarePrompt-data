Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).
- `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `j` is set to the value of `n`.

### Print Statement
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant value `1` that will be printed as is.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Since `j` is set to `n`, `n - j` evaluates to `0`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1` which is `1`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so it will print each number in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Final Output
The print statement will output:
- The constant value `1`.
- The value `1` (from `n - j + 1`).
- The sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1)**

To make it more precise, let's format it as requested:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the given positive integer)**
