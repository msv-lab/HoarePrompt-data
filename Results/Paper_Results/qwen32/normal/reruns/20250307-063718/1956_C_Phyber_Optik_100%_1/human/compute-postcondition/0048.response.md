The code snippet provided modifies the value of the variable `sum` based on the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the variables.

The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `2*i - 1`, because:
\[ i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1) = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1. \]

Thus, the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to:
\[ (2i - 1) * i = 2i^2 - i. \]

This value is then added to the current value of `sum`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `j` are not modified by the provided code snippet, so they retain their initial values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `sum` is 1.
- `j` is \(n + 1\).

After the execution of the provided code snippet, the new value of `sum` is:
\[ \text{new sum} = 1 + (2i^2 - i). \]

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we will represent the new `sum` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `j` is \(n + 1\)**.
