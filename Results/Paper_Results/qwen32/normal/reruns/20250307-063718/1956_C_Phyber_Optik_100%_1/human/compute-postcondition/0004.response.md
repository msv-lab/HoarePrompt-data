To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(2, n + 1)` contains at least one integer. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute because:
- If `n` is 1, the range is `(2, 2)` which is empty, and thus the loop does not execute.
- If `n` is 2 or greater, the range will contain at least the number 2, and the loop will execute.

The variable `i` is automatically initialized to the starting value of the range (which is 2 in this case) when the loop begins, so we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The variable `t` (number of test cases) and `sum` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes. However, since `t` is mentioned as an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, we should ensure it meets this condition, even though it does not directly impact the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `sum` is 1**
