The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be 2. The value of `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` must be at least 2, `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop, `j` is 2**
