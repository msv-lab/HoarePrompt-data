Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `sum` is a mathematical expression \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), but it is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is a constant `1`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`.
   - `n` is given as an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be defined elsewhere in the code. However, since `j` is not provided, we will assume it is a variable that has a value known in the context where this print statement is executed. Given the context, let's assume `j` is defined such that `n - j + 1` is a valid integer.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The third argument uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - This means it will print the numbers `1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence starting with `1`, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Given the lack of a specific value for `j`, we can describe the output in terms of `j`:

Output: **1, n - j + 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and j is a defined integer in the context)**
