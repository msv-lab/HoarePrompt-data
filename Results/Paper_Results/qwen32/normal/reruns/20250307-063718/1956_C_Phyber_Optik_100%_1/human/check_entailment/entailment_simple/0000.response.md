### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations involve permuting the rows and columns of the matrix.

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix. For an n x n matrix, the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix such that each row and each column contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
   - The formula used to calculate the sum is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
     Simplifying the summation part:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
     Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first n natural numbers, this can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{3} - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n}{6} - \frac{3n^2 + 3n}{6} + 1 = \frac{n^3 - n}{6} + 1
     \]
     However, the provided code calculates the sum using a loop, which is equivalent to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]

2. **Operations Description**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`.
   - For each test case, it performs `n` operations of type 1 and `n` operations of type 2. Each operation is described by the row/column index and a permutation.
   - The operations are described as follows:
     - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it performs:
       - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
       - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The operations described in the program do not actually maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations simply fill the matrix with the same permutation in a specific order, which does not guarantee the maximum sum.

### Correctness:

The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations described do not ensure that each row and each column contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once, which is required to achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
