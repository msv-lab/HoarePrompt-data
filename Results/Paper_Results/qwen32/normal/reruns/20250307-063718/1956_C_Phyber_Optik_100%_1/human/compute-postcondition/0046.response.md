The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `sum`. This means that the previous value of `sum`, which was \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), is overwritten by `1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is the new input integer, `sum` is 1, `j` is \(n + 1\) based on the initial `n`.**
