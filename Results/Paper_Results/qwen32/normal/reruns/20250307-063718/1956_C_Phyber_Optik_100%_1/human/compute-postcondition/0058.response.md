The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is \(n + 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to \(n + 2\). However, since the loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`, the loop will not execute if `j` is \(n + 2\). Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be 1 and increment `n` by 1 to allow the loop to execute again with a new range.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` must be at least 2, `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop, `j` is 1**
