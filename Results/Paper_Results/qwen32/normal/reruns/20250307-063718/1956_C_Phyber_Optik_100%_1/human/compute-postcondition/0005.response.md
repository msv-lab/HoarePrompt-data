The code snippet modifies the value of the variable `sum` by adding to it the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. The expression simplifies to `i * i * i`, which is `i` cubed. Therefore, `sum` is incremented by `i` cubed.

The initial values of `t` and `n` are not affected by the code snippet provided, and `sum` is updated based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `sum` is 1 + i^3**.
