Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is defined as \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\).
- `j` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**: The first argument to be printed is the integer `2`.
2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - Given `j` is 2, the expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

### Putting It All Together:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `n - 1`.
- The third part involves unpacking the range from 1 to `n`, so it will print each number in that range sequentially.

### Example:
If `n` were 5, the output would be:
- First value: `2`
- Second value: `5 - 1` which is `4`
- Third part: Unpacking `range(1, 5 + 1)` gives `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

### General Output:
Given the above steps, the output for any valid `n` (where `n` is at least 1) will be:
- `2`
- `n - 1`
- Followed by the numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 1)**
