Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop.
- `j` is \(n + 1\).

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`**:
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `2`. This is explicitly given and does not depend on any variables.

2. **Value of `n - j + 1`**:
   - We know that `j` is defined as \(n + 1\).
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to:
     \[
     n - (n + 1) + 1 = n - n - 1 + 1 = 0
     \]
   - So, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `0`.

3. **Value of `*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, 6)` would generate the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Putting it All Together:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `0` (from `n - j + 1`).
- The third and subsequent values printed are the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be `2`, followed by `0`, and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer)**

For clarity, if `n` is 5, the output would be:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**
