Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
2. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
4. `j` is set to the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`:** The number `2` is explicitly printed as the first argument in the `print` statement.
2. **Value of `n - j + 1`:** Since `j` is set to `n`, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - n + 1`, which is `1`.
3. **Value of `*range(1, n + 1)`:** The `*range(1, n + 1)` part expands to a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n` is `5`, this would expand to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output:
Combining all the parts, the `print` statement will output `2`, followed by `1`, and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is `5`, the output would be:
```
2 1 1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
Given that `n` is a variable and can take any value greater than or equal to 1, the output will always start with `2` and `1`, followed by the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
