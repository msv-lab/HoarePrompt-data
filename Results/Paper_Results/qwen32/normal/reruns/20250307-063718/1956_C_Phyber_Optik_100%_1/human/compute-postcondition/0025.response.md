To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 2, which means `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will start from 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `sum` is 1.
- `j` is the previous `n + 1`.

Since `t`, `sum`, and `j` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is 1, `j` is the previous `n + 1`**
