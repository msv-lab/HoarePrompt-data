To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change.

The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`, meaning it will execute `n` times. Given the initial state and the provided outputs after the first few iterations, we can infer the state after all iterations.

Here is the loop code for reference:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

In each iteration, the loop prints two lines:
1. `1, n - j + 1, 1, 2, ..., n`
2. `2, n - j + 1, 1, 2, ..., n`

After the loop completes all `n` iterations, `j` will be `n+1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive. The values of `t` and `sum` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- `t` remains the same as the input integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `sum` remains the same as `(n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1`.
- `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.

Output State: **t is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; n is an input integer; sum is (n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1; j is n + 1**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `j` will have the value `n + 1`, while `t`, `n`, and `sum` will retain their initial values.
