The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the value of `n` does not change within the loop, we only need to adjust `j`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 1; `sum` is (n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1; `j` is 2**
