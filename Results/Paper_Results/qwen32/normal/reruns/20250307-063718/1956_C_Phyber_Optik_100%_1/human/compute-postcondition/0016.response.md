Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is defined as \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\).
- `j` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Element (`1`)**:
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

2. **Second Element (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `j` is given as `2`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` which is `n - 1`.

3. **Third Element (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Output:
The print statement will output the number `1`, followed by `n - 1`, and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 1)**
