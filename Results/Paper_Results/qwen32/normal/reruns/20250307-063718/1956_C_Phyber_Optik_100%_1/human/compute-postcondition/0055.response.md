To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `j` and the range `(1, n + 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n` inclusive.
2. **Dependencies**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least `1` because the range `(1, n + 1)` will contain at least one value (`1`) if `n` is `1` or greater.
3. **Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as `n + 1` before the loop starts. However, this initial value of `j` does not affect the loop's execution because `j` is reassigned in the loop header.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: Must be at least `1` to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.
- **`j`**: The initial value of `j` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted because `j` is set by the loop header.

### Final State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2 (no adjustment needed for loop execution).
- `n` must be at least `1` (adjustment needed).
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop (no adjustment needed before loop execution).
- `j` is `n + 1` (no adjustment needed for loop execution).

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop, `j` is \(n + 1\)**
