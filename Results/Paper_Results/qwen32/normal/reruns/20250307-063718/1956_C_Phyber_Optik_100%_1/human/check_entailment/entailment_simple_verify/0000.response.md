### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeroes.
- **Operations:**
  1. **Type 1:** Choose a row i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[i,j] = p[j]` for all j.
  2. **Type 2:** Choose a column i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n] and set `a[j,i] = p[j]` for all j.
- **Constraints:** No more than 2n operations.
- **Output:** The maximum sum and the operations used to achieve this sum.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum sum and prints the operations.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   sum = 1
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
   ```
   - This loop iterates from 2 to n, adding the contribution of each row/column to the sum. The formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is incorrect for calculating the sum of the first i natural numbers repeated i times. The correct formula for the sum of the first i natural numbers is `i * (i + 1) / 2`. However, the provided formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers repeated i times, which is `i * (i + 1) / 2 * i = i^2 * (i + 1) / 2`.

2. **Operations Output:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + n)
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
       print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, each consisting of a Type 1 and a Type 2 operation on rows and columns respectively, using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

#### Verification Against Problem Description:
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculation is incorrect. The formula used does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the highest possible values using permutations. The maximum sum for an n x n matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] in each row and column, which results in a sum of `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.

- **Operations Output:**
  - The operations are valid as they use permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] and apply them to rows and columns. However, the operations do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum due to the incorrect sum calculation.

#### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, it seems that the sum calculation is incorrect, and thus the program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The operations output is valid in terms of the constraints but does not achieve the maximum sum due to the incorrect sum calculation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
