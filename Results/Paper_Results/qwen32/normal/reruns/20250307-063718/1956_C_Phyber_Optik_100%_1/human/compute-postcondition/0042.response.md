Let's break down the given code and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `j` is set to 1.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Breakdown of the Print Statement:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - This is a constant value `2` which will be printed as is.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `j` is given as 1.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which further simplifies to `n`.
   - This means the second value printed will be `n`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument.

### Final Output:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `n`.
- The third part of the print statement prints all numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be a sequence starting with `2`, followed by `n`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
