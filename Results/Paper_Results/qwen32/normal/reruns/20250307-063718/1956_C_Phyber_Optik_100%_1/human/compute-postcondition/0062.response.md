To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the print statement and the variables involved:

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis of Variables:
1. **`1`**: This is a constant integer value.
2. **`n - j + 1`**: 
   - `n` is described as an integer that must be at least 2.
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` which is `n - 1`.
3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: 
   - This unpacks the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, 5 + 1)` would be `range(1, 6)` which unpacks to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Putting It All Together:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `n - 1`.
- The remaining values are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
If `n` is 5 (as an example, since `n` must be at least 2):
- `n - j + 1` becomes `5 - 2 + 1` which is `4`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` becomes `*range(1, 6)` which unpacks to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output:
Given the above, the output of the print statement would be:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**

To provide a more precise and concrete example, let's assume `n = 5`:
Output: **1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**

However, since we are asked to provide the most precise description based on the precondition without assuming a specific value for `n`, the final answer is:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
