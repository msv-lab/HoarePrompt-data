To determine the output of the `print(sum, n + n)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
   - `j` is the previous `n + 1`.

2. **Calculating `sum`:**
   - The formula for `sum` is given by \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
   - This formula calculates a specific value based on the input integer `n`.

3. **Printing Values:**
   - The `print(sum, n + n)` statement will print two values:
     1. The value of `sum`, which is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
     2. The value of `n + n`, which simplifies to `2 * n`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement will be:
- The first value is the result of the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- The second value is `2 * n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **\(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
