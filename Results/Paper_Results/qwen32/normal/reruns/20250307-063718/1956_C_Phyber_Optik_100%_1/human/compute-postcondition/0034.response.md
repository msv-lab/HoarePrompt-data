To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, so the variables `j` and `n` need to be adjusted.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the range `(1, n + 1)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Variable `j`:** The loop initializes `j` to 1 at the start of the first iteration. The state `j` is the previous `n + 1` before the loop starts, but this state is irrelevant to the loop's execution because `j` is reassigned at the start of each iteration. Thus, the initial value of `j` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is at least 1. The value of `t` (number of test cases minus 1) and `sum` (which is a function of `n`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `j` is the previous `n + 1`**. 

However, since `j` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we can simplify the state to:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\)**.
