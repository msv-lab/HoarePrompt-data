Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `sum` is calculated as \((n(n+1)/2)^2 - 1\).

The code snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's analyze the print statement:
- The first argument is the integer `1`.
- The second argument is `n - j + 1`. However, `j` is not defined in the initial state or the given code snippet. This suggests that `j` could be a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code, possibly within a loop or a function. Since `j` is not defined here, we cannot determine its exact value. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `j` is a variable that is known or defined in the context where this print statement is executed.
- The third part, `*range(1, n + 1)`, uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

Given this information, the output will look like:
- The first number printed is `1`.
- The second number printed is `n - j + 1`, where `j` is some integer value that is not specified in the given information.
- The remaining numbers printed are the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Since `j` is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical value for `n - j + 1`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `j`.

Output: **1, n - j + 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where j is an integer and n is at least 1)**
