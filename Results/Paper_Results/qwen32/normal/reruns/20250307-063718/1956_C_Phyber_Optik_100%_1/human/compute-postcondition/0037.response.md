The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value (let's denote it as `j_end`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_end + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j_end + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which implies `j_end < n`.

Given that `j` was `j_end` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end + 1`. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j_end`, we can denote the new value of `j` as `j_end + 1`. However, we know that `j_end` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, so if `j_end` was `n`, the loop would have just finished. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j_end` must have been `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, making `j` equal to `n` at the start of the next iteration.

However, since the task is to describe the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be one less than `n + 1`, which means `j` should be `n` at the start of the next iteration if the loop is to execute again. But since we are looking for the state right before the loop condition is checked again, `j` should be incremented from its previous value to `j_end + 1`.

Thus, if `j_end` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `j` is `n`**
