Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix or generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve that sum.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The sum of all elements in the matrix when filled optimally should be the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`. The current logic does not compute this correctly.

2. **Operations**: The operations are not optimized to achieve the maximum sum. The program performs `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations, but the operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the matrix is filled with the numbers 1 through `n^2` in a way that maximizes the sum, which is simply filling the matrix with the numbers 1 through `n^2` in any order. One straightforward way to do this is to fill each row with a permutation of numbers 1 through `n`, and each column with a permutation of numbers 1 through `n` in a way that all numbers from 1 to `n^2` are used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = (n * n * (n * n + 1)) // 2
        print(total_sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            # Fill row j with numbers 1 to n
            print(1, j, *range(1, n + 1))
            # Fill column j with numbers 1 to n
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This program calculates the correct maximum sum and generates the correct sequence of operations to achieve that sum.
