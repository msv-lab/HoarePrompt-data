Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `sum` is the calculated sum based on the loop (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - The first argument is a constant integer `2`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is `n`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range, meaning all numbers from 1 to `n` are printed as separate arguments.

### Output:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `n`.
- The third part prints the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
The output will be `2`, followed by `n`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
