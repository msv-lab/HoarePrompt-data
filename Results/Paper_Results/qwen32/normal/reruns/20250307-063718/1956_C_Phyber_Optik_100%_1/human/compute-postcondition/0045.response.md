The code snippet provided reads a new input integer and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to the new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `sum`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `j` is \(n + 1\).

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` will be updated to the new input integer. The values of `t`, `sum`, and `j` will no longer reflect the initial `n` value, but they retain their definitions based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, `n` is the new input integer, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) based on the initial `n`, `j` is \(n + 1\) based on the initial `n`.**
