Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the matrix size and prints this sum along with `2n`. It then prints a sequence of `2n` lines, each containing a specific pattern of numbers related to the matrix size.**
