The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be such that `i < n + 1`.

Given that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, and `sum` is updated to `sum + 2*i`, these variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. The value of `n` must be at least `i_end + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `n` must be at least `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + 2*i`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be at least `i + 1`, `sum` is updated to `sum + 2*i`**

To be more specific, if `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, the next state would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `sum` is updated to `sum + 2*i`**

But since we need a generalized form:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be at least `i + 1`**
