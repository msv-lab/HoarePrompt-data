The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`, printing specific lines in each iteration. Given the pattern of the loop, the loop will execute exactly `n` times. After all iterations are completed, the loop variable `j` will be `n + 1` as it will have reached the end of the range.

The output state after all iterations will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases minus 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer.
- `sum` remains unchanged as it is calculated once and does not change throughout the loop.
- `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes all iterations.

Output State: **t is an input integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, n is a new input integer, sum is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), j is n + 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `j` will be `n + 1`, while `t`, `n`, and `sum` will retain their initial values.
