The code snippet assigns a new value to the `char_map` dictionary where the key is `c` (the character in the sorted set of `b` at position `i + 1`), and the value is a new character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `char_map[c]` is updated with a new value.
- The value is determined by the character 'a' shifted by the expression `(len(b) - i - 1)`.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `i`, and `c`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` has `c` mapped to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the character in the sorted set of `b` at position `i + 1`**.
