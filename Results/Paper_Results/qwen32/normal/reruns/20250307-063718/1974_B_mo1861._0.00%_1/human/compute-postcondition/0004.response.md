The provided code snippet assigns a value to the dictionary `char_map` using the character `c` as the key. The value assigned is a character determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since the variable `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we can describe the transformation that occurs to `char_map`.

Given that `b` is a string of length `n`, the expression `(len(b) - i - 1)` will be a value between `0` and `n-1` depending on the value of `i`. This expression is used to calculate the ASCII value of a character starting from 'a' up to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet.

Since `char_map` was initially empty, after executing the code snippet, it will contain one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet, depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry: `char_map[c]` is a character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet determined by `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.**
