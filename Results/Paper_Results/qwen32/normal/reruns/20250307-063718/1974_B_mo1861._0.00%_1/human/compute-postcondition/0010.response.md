The code snippet provided initializes an empty string `s`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `char_map`) are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `char_map`, while `s` will be an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is an empty string.**
