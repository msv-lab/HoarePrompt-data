The given code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary will be used to map characters to some values, but since no operations are performed on it in the provided code, its state remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
