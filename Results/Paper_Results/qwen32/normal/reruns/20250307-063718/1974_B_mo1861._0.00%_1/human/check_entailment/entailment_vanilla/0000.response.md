Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Step 1:** The program creates a set of unique characters from the string `b` and sorts them alphabetically. This set represents the string `r` in the problem description.
   - **Step 2:** It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. However, this formula is incorrect for creating the symmetric character from `r`. Instead, the symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.
   - **Step 3:** The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `char_map`.

### Issues Identified

- **Incorrect Symmetric Character Mapping:**
  - The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It attempts to map characters to a range starting from 'a', which is not what the problem requires. Instead, we need to map characters to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set `r`.
  - The correct mapping should be: `char_map[c] = sorted(set(b))[len(r) - i - 1]`.

### Corrected Code Snippet

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of symmetric characters. The corrected version of the program should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart correctly.

Correctness: **False**
