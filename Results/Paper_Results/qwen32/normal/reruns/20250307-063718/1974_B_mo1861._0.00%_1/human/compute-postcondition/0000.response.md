The provided Python code snippet is a function definition that is intended to decode a given string `b` to restore the original string `s`. However, the actual implementation of the function is missing. Since there is no code within the function to manipulate or decode the string `b`, the variables `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. The function does not modify any of the input variables and does not return any value.

Given that there is no executable code within the function, the output state will be the same as the initial state. The function does not perform any operations that would alter the values of `t`, `n`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
