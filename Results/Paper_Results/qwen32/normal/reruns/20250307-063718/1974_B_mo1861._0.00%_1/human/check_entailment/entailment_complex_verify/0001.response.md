### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the original program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Construct the auxiliary string \( r \):**
   - \( r \) consists of all distinct letters of the string \( s \) in alphabetical order.
2. **Encode the string \( s \):**
   - Each character in \( s \) is replaced by its symmetric character in \( r \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded string \( b \) for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Step 1:** The program creates a set of unique characters from the string \( b \) and sorts them alphabetically. This set represents the string \( r \) in the problem description.
     ```python
     for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
     ```
   - **Step 2:** It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula:
     ```python
     char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
     ```
     This formula is incorrect. Instead, the symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.
   - **Step 3:** The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `char_map`.
     ```python
     for c in b:
         s += char_map[c]
     ```

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Symmetric Character Mapping:**
  - The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` incorrectly maps characters to a range starting from 'a'. This is not what the problem requires. Instead, we need to map characters to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set `r`.
  - The correct mapping should be:
    ```python
    char_map[c] = sorted(set(b))[len(r) - i - 1]
    ```

#### Corrected Code Snippet:
Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of symmetric characters. The corrected version of the program should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
