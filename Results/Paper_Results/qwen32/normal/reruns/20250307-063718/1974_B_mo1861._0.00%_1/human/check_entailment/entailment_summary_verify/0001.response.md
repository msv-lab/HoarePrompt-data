### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the original program and the function summary provided.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` to get the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.
   - The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of unique characters from `s` in alphabetical order, then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Original Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1(b)` is supposed to decode `b` to get `s`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Step 1:** It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - **Step 2:** It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - **Step 3:** It constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped character from `char_map`.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The summary states that the function maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r` using a reversed mapping of the sorted unique characters.
   - However, the summary incorrectly mentions mapping to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is not aligned with the problem description.

5. **Correct Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r` directly, not to a range starting from 'a'.
   - Specifically, `char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]` where `r` is the sorted list of unique characters from `b`.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   - The corrected version of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(b):
         r = sorted(set(b))
         char_map = {}
         for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
             char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
         s = ''
         for c in b:
             s += char_map[c]
         return s
     ```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the mapping in the original program is incorrect. The original program maps characters to a range starting from 'a', which is not what the problem requires.
- The corrected version of the function `func_1` correctly maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is indeed incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of symmetric characters. The corrected version of the program is necessary to achieve the correct decoding.

**Final: False**
