### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s` based on the encoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Constructing the `char_map` Dictionary:**
   - The program first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then maps each unique character `c` in the sorted set to its symmetric character from the end of the alphabet-ordered set. This mapping is stored in the `char_map` dictionary.
   - For example, if `b = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters in `b` are `{'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'}`. After sorting, we get `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`. The mapping `char_map` will be:
     - `c -> s`
     - `d -> r`
     - `e -> o`
     - `f -> f`
     - `o -> e`
     - `r -> d`
     - `s -> c`

2. **Decoding the String `b`:**
   - The program then iterates over each character `c` in the encoded string `b` and uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`.
   - It appends the mapped character to the result string `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the decoded string `s` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue in the program is the incorrect mapping of characters in the `char_map` dictionary. The program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set to a character from the alphabet starting from 'a', which is not the intended mapping.

**Correct Mapping:**
- The problem statement describes the encoding process where the first character in the sorted set `r` is replaced by the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` is replaced by the second last character in `r`, and so on.
- Therefore, the correct mapping should be between the characters in the sorted set `r` and their symmetric counterparts in the same set `r`.

### Corrected Mapping:
- For example, for `b = "serofedsoc"`, the sorted unique characters are `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`. The correct mapping `char_map` should be:
  - `s -> c`
  - `e -> o`
  - `r -> d`
  - `o -> e`
  - `f -> f`
  - `d -> r`
  - `c -> s`

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it maps characters incorrectly. The correct mapping should be between characters in the sorted set `r` and their symmetric counterparts in the same set `r`.

**Correctness: False**
