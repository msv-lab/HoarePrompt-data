The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `b` and the variable `c`. If there are more characters in `b`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the next character in `b`, and `s` now includes the character `char_map[c]`.

To execute one more time, `c` must be the next character in `b` after the current `c`. Since `c` is the current character being processed, the next iteration will naturally take the next character from `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`, `c` is the next character in `b`**.

Since `c` is the loop variable, the next iteration will automatically assign the next character in `b` to `c`. Therefore, we don't need to explicitly state that `c` is the next character in `b` again, but it's implied by the loop mechanics.
