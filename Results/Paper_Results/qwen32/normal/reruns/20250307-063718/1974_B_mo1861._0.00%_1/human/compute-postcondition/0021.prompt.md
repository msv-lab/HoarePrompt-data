You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: - `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
    #- `n` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
    #- `b` remains unchanged as a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    #- `char_map` remains unchanged as a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`.
    #- `s` is now a string of length `n` where each character is the mapped character from `char_map` corresponding to the characters in `b`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is the mapped character from `char_map` corresponding to the characters in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `s` of the same length `n` where each character in `s` is the mapped character from `char_map` corresponding to the characters in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is the mapped character from `char_map` corresponding to the characters in `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
