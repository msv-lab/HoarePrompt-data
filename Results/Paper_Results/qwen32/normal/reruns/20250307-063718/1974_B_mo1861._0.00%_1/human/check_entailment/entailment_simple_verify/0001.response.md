### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original program and the annotations provided to determine if the program correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Construct `r`:** `r` is the string of all distinct letters in `s`, sorted alphabetically.
2. **Encoding:** Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the position in `r`: the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Annotations and Observations:
1. **State Before Function Call:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `n` is the length of the encoded string `b`.
   - `b` is the encoded string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Inside `func_1`:**
   - `char_map` is created by mapping each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character determined by `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it tries to map characters to a range starting from 'a', which is not the intended symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Output State:**
   - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character from `char_map`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Symmetric Character Mapping:**
  - The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It attempts to map characters to a range starting from 'a', which is not what the problem requires.
  - The correct mapping should be: `char_map[c] = sorted(set(b))[len(r) - i - 1]`.

#### Corrected Code Snippet:
Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program is indeed incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of symmetric characters. The corrected version of the program should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
