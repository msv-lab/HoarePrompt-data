Reasoning:
The provided program aims to decode an encoded string `b` back to its original form `s` based on a specific encoding algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a mapping from the unique characters in `b` to a reversed alphabetical order, then using this mapping to transform `b` back to `s`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it compares to the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Mapping Construction**:
   - Inside `func_1(b)`, it creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in the sorted set to its symmetric counterpart in the reversed alphabet. This is done by associating the first character in the sorted set with the last character in the alphabet, the second character with the second-to-last character, and so on.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The function initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It iterates over each character `c` in `b`, looks up its mapped value in `char_map`, and appends this value to `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the decoded string `s`.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It properly constructs the mapping based on the unique characters in the encoded string and uses this mapping to decode the string back to its original form.

Given the example provided in the problem statement, the program would correctly produce the expected outputs for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
