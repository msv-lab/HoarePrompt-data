Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. The issue lies in the creation of the `char_map` dictionary. The mapping should be based on the distinct characters in the string `b` sorted in alphabetical order, and each character should be mapped to its symmetric character in the reversed sorted list.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
char_map = {}
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```
This code incorrectly maps each character to a character starting from 'a' plus some offset. Instead, it should map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list of distinct characters.

Let's correct this by creating the mapping correctly:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s

num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))
```

In this corrected version, `char_map` is created such that each character in the sorted list of distinct characters is mapped to its symmetric character in the reversed list. This ensures that the decoding process works correctly for all potential cases.
