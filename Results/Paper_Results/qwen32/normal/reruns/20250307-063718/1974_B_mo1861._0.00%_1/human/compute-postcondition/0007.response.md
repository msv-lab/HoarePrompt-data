The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `c`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the enumerated sorted set of `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the next iteration. Similarly, `c` should be the next character in the sorted set of `b`.

Let's denote the sorted set of `b` as `sorted_b`. If `c` was the `i`-th character in `sorted_b` at the end of the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `c` should be the `(i+1)`-th character in `sorted_b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with updated entry `char_map[c]` assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 2))`, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary (state of `char_map` is not changed in the loop head), `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the character in the sorted set of `b` at position `i + 1`**
