Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - **Step 1:** Create a string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - **Step 2:** Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. The first character in `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

2. **Decoding Process (what the program should do):**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2:** Create a mapping where each character in the sorted list maps to its symmetric counterpart in the alphabet (reversed order).
   - **Step 3:** Replace each character in `b` using the created mapping to reconstruct the original string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
- It then creates a mapping where each character maps to its symmetric counterpart in the alphabet in reverse order. However, there is an error in the program's logic:
  - The program maps each character to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect. This would map the characters to a sequence starting from 'a' and going up to 'z', which is not the intended behavior. Instead, the program should map to the characters in the sorted list of unique characters in `b` in reverse order.
- The `char_map` should map each character in the sorted list of unique characters to the corresponding character in the reversed list of unique characters.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should be:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping logic. It should map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters, not to a sequence starting from 'a'.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**
