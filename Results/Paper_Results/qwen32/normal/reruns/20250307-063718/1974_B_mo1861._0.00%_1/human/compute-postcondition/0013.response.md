The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over each character in the string `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `c` to the next character in the string `b`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`.
- `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` has taken on a value that corresponds to a character in `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next character in `b`.

Let's denote the current character in `b` as `b[j]` where `j` is the current index of `c` in `b`. After the loop body executes, `c` would have been `b[j]`. For the next iteration, `c` should be `b[j+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`, `c` is the next character in `b` after the current `c`.** 

To be more precise, if `c` was `b[j]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `b[j+1]` provided `j+1 < n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`, `c` is the next character in `b` after the current `c`.** 

Since we don't have the exact index `j`, we can't specify `b[j+1]` directly, but we know `c` will be the next character in the sequence of `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`, `c` is the next character in `b`.**
