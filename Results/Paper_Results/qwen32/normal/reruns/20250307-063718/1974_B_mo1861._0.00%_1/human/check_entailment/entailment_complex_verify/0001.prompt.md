You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Step 1:** The program creates a set of unique characters from the string `b` and sorts them alphabetically. This set represents the string `r` in the problem description.
   - **Step 2:** It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. However, this formula is incorrect for creating the symmetric character from `r`. Instead, the symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.
   - **Step 3:** The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `char_map`.

### Issues Identified

- **Incorrect Symmetric Character Mapping:**
  - The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It attempts to map characters to a range starting from 'a', which is not what the problem requires. Instead, we need to map characters to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set `r`.
  - The correct mapping should be: `char_map[c] = sorted(set(b))[len(r) - i - 1]`.

### Corrected Code Snippet

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of symmetric characters. The corrected version of the program should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart correctly.

Correctness: **False**
