Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, `char_map` will contain each unique character from the string `b` as keys, and each key will be mapped to a character starting from 'a' up to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet. The mapping is done such that the smallest character in the sorted set of unique characters in `b` is mapped to 'a', the second smallest to 'b', and so on, up to the largest character which will be mapped to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
