Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`, `c` is the next character in `b`.**

Explanation: The string `s` has been updated to include the character `char_map[c]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `char_map`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
