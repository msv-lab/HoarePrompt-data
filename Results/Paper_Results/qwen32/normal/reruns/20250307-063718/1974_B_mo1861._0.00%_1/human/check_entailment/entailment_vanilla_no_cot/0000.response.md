Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to restore the original string `s`. The issue lies in the way the `char_map` dictionary is constructed. Specifically, the program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to characters in the range of `'a'` to `'z'` instead of mapping them to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set `r`.

Here's the correct approach:

1. Construct the string `r` as the sorted set of characters from `b`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

In this corrected version, `r` is constructed as the sorted set of characters from `b`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. Finally, the program uses this mapping to decode the string `b` into the original string `s`.
