The provided code snippet assigns a value to `char_map` for a specific character `c` based on its position `i` in the string `b`. The value assigned is a character calculated by shifting 'a' by the position from the end of the string `b`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary

The line of code:
```
char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```
Updates `char_map` by adding a key-value pair where:
- The key is `c`, a character from the string `b`
- The value is a character calculated by `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which shifts 'a' by the position of `c` from the end of the string `b`

**Output State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `char_map` is updated with the key `c` and the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000; `n` remains an integer between 1 and 200,000; `b` remains a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters of length `n`; `char_map` now includes a new entry where the key is `c` and the value is a character determined by the position of `c` from the end of `b`.
