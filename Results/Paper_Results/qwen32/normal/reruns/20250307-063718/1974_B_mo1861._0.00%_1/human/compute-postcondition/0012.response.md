The code `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `char_map` remain unchanged, while `s` is updated to include the new character.

Since `char_map` maps each unique character in `b` to a specific character in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, and `c` is a character that exists in `b`, `char_map[c]` will be a specific character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with each unique character in `b` mapped to a unique character from 'a' to the `n`-th letter of the alphabet in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`, `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`.**
