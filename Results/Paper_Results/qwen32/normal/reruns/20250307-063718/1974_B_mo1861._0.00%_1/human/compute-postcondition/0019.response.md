Output State: **The program returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is the mapped character from `char_map` corresponding to the characters in `b`.**

This means that each character in the original string `b` is replaced by its corresponding mapped character from the `char_map` dictionary, resulting in the new string `s`.
