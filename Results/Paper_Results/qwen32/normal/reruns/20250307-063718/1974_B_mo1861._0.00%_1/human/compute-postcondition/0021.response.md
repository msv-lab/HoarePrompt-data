Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `s` of the same length `n` where each character in `s` is a uniquely mapped character from the original characters in `b`, with the mapping determined by the sorted order of unique characters in `b` reversed and mapped to the alphabet in descending order.**
