The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. After the execution of the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
