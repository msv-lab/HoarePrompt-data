The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, `n` was the first integer, and `m` was `m + 1`. After executing the code, `n` and `m` are reassigned to the new values provided by the input. The values of `t`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.**
