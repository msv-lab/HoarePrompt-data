The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are already defined with certain conditions and values. The execution of the code does not affect these preconditions but introduces two new variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
