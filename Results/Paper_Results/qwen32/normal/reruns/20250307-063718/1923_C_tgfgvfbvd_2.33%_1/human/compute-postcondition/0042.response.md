Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each of the `m` iterations, the following conditions are checked: `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the loop prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)`. For each pair, it calculates the sum of the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1` using the cumulative sums stored in `p`. It then checks if the length of this sublist is greater than 1 and if the sum of the sublist is at least twice the length of the sublist. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged except for the loop's progress through the `m` iterations.
