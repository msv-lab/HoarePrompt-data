Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `a` is greater than or equal to 2.**
