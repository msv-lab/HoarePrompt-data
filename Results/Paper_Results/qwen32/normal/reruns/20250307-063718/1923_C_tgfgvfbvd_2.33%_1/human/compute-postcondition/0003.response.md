The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `l` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is an empty list.**
