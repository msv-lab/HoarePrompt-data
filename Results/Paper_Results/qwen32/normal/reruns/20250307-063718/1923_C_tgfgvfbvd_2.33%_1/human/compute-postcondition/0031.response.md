Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- If `a - 2 < 0`, then `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are not used in this print statement. Therefore, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
