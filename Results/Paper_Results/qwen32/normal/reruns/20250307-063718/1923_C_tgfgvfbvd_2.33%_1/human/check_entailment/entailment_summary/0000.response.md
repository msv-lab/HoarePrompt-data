### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on the criteria provided. A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of the elements in `a` (which is the subarray of `c`) equals the sum of the elements in `b`.
2. No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

For a subarray to be "good", it must be possible to construct such an array `b`. The key insight here is that if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, then it is possible to construct such an array `b` by assigning values to `b` that are different from `a` and still positive. For example, if the sum of the subarray is `S` and its length is `L`, and `S >= 2 * L`, then we can assign values to `b` such that the sum of `b` is `S` and all elements in `b` are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

The given program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and uses these to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. For each query, it checks if the sum of the specified subarray is at least twice the length of that subarray. If this condition is satisfied, it prints "YES", indicating that the subarray is "good". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program aligns with the reasoning above. The program efficiently determines whether a subarray is "good" based on the sum condition, and this condition is sufficient for the existence of the array `b` as per the problem statement.
