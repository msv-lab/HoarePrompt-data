The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initially equal to `n`, after executing the code, the list `p` will contain the single element `n`. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c` is `n`.**
