The code snippet provided updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)` or both `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` hold true.**
