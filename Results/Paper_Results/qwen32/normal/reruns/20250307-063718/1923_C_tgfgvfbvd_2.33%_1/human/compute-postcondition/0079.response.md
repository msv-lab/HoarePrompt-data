The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p` to the variable `s`. None of the other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `s` is now assigned the value `p[b - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m - 1` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m - 1` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
