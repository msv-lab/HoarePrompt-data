The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state and the variables described do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is a direct print of the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The code provided does not contain any logic that alters the string `'NO'`.
2. The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
