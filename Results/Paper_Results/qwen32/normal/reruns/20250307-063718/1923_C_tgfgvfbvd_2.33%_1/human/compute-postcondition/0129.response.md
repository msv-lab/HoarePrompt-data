Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, the following has occurred: `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is the number of elements in the list `l` and `m` is the number of queries. `l` is a list of `n` integers. `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For each of the `m` queries, `a` and `b` are integers, and based on these values, the program checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and if `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The state of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` is reset for each test case but remains unchanged within a single test case.**

In simpler terms: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers `l` and a series of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of a specified subarray meets a certain condition and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables are reset at the start of each new test case.
