The given code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means that `s` will now hold the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
