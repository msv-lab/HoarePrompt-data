You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, the following has occurred: `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is the number of elements in the list `l` and `m` is the number of queries. `l` is a list of `n` integers. `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For each of the `m` queries, `a` and `b` are integers, and based on these values, the program checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and if `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The state of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` is reset for each test case but remains unchanged within a single test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l:r+1]` of an array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c[l:r+1]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in `c[l:r+1]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `c`. This is done using the following lines:
     ```python
     p = []
     c = 0
     for x in l:
         c += x
         p.append(c)
     ```
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l:r+1]` using `p[r] - p[l-1]` for `l > 0`, or just `p[r]` for `l = 0`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` (inclusive) of the subarray `c[a:b+1]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `c[a:b+1]` using the prefix sum array:
     ```python
     s = p[b - 1]
     if a - 2 >= 0:
         s -= p[a - 2]
     ```
   - It then checks if the subarray can be "good" based on the condition:
     ```python
     if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
         print('YES')
     else:
         print('NO')
     ```
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for the existence of a different array `b` that meets the criteria.
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for the construction of an array `b` where each element is strictly greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `c[a:b+1]`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Condition Analysis:**
  - If `b - a + 1 > 1`, it means the subarray has more than one element.
  - The sum `s` of the subarray must be at least `2 * (b - a + 1)` to ensure that we can construct an array `b` where each element is strictly greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `c[a:b+1]`. This is because the smallest possible sum for such an array `b` is `b - a + 1` (all elements being 1), and we need to ensure that the sum of `b` can be `s` while also ensuring that `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the subarray has only one element (`b - a + 1 == 1`), it cannot be "good" because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with a single element that is strictly greater than 0 and different from `c[a]`.
  - If the sum `s` of the subarray is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`, it is impossible to construct such an array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
