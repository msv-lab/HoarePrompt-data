The given code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement. The task is to determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- Additionally, either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1 or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).

The `print('NO')` statement is executed regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. The condition provided in the initial state does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
