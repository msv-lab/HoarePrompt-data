The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `x`. Given that `c` was initially `2 * x`, after the operation `c += x`, `c` becomes `2 * x + x`, which simplifies to `3 * x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 more element; `p` is a list containing the values of `x` and `2 * x`; `c` is `3 * x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
