Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. **n**: The first integer read from the input.
3. **m**: An integer greater than 0.
4. **l**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **p**: A list of cumulative sums of `l`. This means `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.
6. **c**: The sum of all elements in `l`.
7. **a** and **b**: Two integers read from the input.
8. **s**: Calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`:
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.
9. **Conditions**:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` is true.
   - `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This string is directly hardcoded in the print statement and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
