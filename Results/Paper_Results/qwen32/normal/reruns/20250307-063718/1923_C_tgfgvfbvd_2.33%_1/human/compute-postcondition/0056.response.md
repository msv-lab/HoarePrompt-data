The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` initially contains the second element of `l` and the second element of `l` plus `x`. After appending `c` (which is the second element of `l` plus `2*x`), `p` will now have three elements: the second element of `l`, the second element of `l` plus `x`, and the second element of `l` plus `2*x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `p` is a list containing the second element of `l`, the second element of `l` plus `x`, and the second element of `l` plus `2*x`; `c` is the second element of `l` plus `2*x`; `x` is the next element in `l`.**
