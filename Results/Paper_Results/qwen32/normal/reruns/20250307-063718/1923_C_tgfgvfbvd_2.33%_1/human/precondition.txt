t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing two integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), a list of n integers c (1 <= c_i <= 10^9), and a list of q tuples, each containing two integers l_i and r_i (1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
