The code snippet `c += x` increments the value of `c` by `x`. Given that `c` is initially `n + x`, after executing `c += x`, the new value of `c` becomes `n + x + x`, which simplifies to `n + 2x`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements.
- `p` remains a list containing the elements `n` and `c`.
- `c` is now `n + 2x`.
- `x` remains the third element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the elements `n` and `c`, `c` is `n + 2x`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**
