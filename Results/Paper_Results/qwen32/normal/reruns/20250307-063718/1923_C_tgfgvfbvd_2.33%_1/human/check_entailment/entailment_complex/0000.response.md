### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

The problem states that a subarray is "good" if:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

The key observation here is that for a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray. This is because if the sum of the subarray is less than twice its length, it would be impossible to create a corresponding array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the subarray's element.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It reads the array `c` of `n` integers.
   - For each of the `q` queries, it reads the indices `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative sum array `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `c`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` using the cumulative sum array.
   - It then checks if the length of the subarray (`b - a + 1`) is greater than 1 and if `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" by checking if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length and if the subarray has more than one element. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
