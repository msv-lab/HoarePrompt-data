The only object in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation or the state of other variables. The loop will execute based on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, which is `m` in this case. Since the loop has already executed `m` times, the next iteration would imply that `m` was incremented by 1.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left, which is controlled by the loop variable. Since the loop variable `_` does not hold any state that we can modify directly, we need to consider the state of `m` implicitly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer + 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

Note: The state of `m` is incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
