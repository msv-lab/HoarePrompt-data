To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array \( b \) of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray \( a \) equals the sum of elements in \( b \).
2. No element in \( a \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( b \).
3. All elements in \( b \) are greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program calculates the prefix sums of the array \( c \) and then uses these prefix sums to determine the sum of any subarray efficiently. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

#### Key Points:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array \( c \).
- **Sum Calculation for Subarrays**: It uses the prefix sums to calculate the sum of any subarray \( c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i} \).
- **Condition Check**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is used to determine if the subarray can be "good". This condition is derived from the fact that for the subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be large enough to allow each element to be split into two positive integers (one for the subarray and one for \( b \)), with at least one unit difference between the corresponding elements of \( a \) and \( b \).

### Correctness:
The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem description. If the sum of a subarray is at least twice its length, it is possible to construct an array \( b \) that satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the program correctly determines if a subarray is "good".

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
