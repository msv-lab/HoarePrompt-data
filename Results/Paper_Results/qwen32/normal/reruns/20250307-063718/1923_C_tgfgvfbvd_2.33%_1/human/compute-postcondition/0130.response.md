Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array `c` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `c` consists of `n` integers, and each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range in the array. The function processes these test cases and queries, and for each query, it returns the result based on the specified range in the array.**
