The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` and `m - 1` are integers with `n` being the first integer and `m - 1` being the second integer, and `m - 1` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
   - `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`:
     - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
     - If `a - 2 < 0`, then `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The print statement `print('NO')` is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m - 1`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Given the independence of the print statement from the variables in the initial state, the output is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
