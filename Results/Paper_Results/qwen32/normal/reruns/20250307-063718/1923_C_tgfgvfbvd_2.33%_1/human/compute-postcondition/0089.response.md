The code snippet `p = []` resets the list `p` to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.**
