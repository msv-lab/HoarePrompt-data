The code snippet `p.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is `2 * x`, the list `p` will now contain the original value of `x` followed by `2 * x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `p` is a list containing the values of `x` and `2 * x`; `c` is `2 * x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
