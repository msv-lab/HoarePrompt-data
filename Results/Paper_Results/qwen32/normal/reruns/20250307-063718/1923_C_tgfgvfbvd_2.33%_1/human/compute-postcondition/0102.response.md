The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
