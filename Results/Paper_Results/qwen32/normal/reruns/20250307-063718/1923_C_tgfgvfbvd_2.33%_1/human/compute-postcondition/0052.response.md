Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `p` is a list containing the second element of `l`; `c` is the second element of `l`

```
c += x
```

Now, the value of `c` is updated to be the original value of `c` plus the value of `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `p` is a list containing the second element of `l`; `c` is the second element of `l` plus `x`.**
