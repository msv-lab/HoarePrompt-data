Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` is true, and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is also true.**
