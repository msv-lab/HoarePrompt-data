The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `n + 2x` and `x` is the third element in the list `l`, the value of `c` is `n + 2 * l[2]`. The list `p` initially contains the elements `n` and `c`, and after the append operation, it will contain `n`, `c`, and `c` again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the elements `n`, `c`, and `c`, `c` is `n + 2 * l[2]`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**
