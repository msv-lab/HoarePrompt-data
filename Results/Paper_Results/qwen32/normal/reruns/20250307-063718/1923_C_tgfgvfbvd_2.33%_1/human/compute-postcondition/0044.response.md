The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input, where `m` is the second integer plus one. However, the code snippet does not modify `m` by adding one; it simply reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`.

Given this, the value of `m` will now be the second integer from the input, not the second integer plus one as previously stated. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**
