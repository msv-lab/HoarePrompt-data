The provided code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means the value of `s` is now specifically `p[b - 1]`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, and `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
