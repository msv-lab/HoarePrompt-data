The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, and `a - 2 >= 0`. `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
