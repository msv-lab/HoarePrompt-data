In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the integer `m`. The loop will execute `m` times, where `m` is the number of iterations specified. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, the only requirement is that `m` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable used in the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`**
