Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, l is a list of integers read from the input, p is a list of cumulative sums of l, c is the sum of all elements in l. The loop has executed m times, and for each iteration, a and b are the integers read from the input. If a - 2 >= 0, s is p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]; otherwise, s is p[b - 1]. The program prints 'YES' if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of t, n, m, l, p, and c remain unchanged after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run for `m` iterations, the program will have processed `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input. For each pair, it calculates the sum `s` of the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1` using the cumulative sums stored in `p`. It then checks if the length of the sublist is greater than 1 and if the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the sublist. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain the same throughout the execution of the loop.
