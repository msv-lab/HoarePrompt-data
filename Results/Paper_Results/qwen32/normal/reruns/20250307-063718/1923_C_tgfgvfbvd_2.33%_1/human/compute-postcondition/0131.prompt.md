You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, the following has occurred: `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is the number of elements in the list `l` and `m` is the number of queries. `l` is a list of `n` integers. `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For each of the `m` queries, `a` and `b` are integers, and based on these values, the program checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and if `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The state of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` is reset for each test case but remains unchanged within a single test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array `c` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `c` consists of `n` integers, and each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range in the array. The function processes these test cases and queries, and for each query, it returns the result based on the specified range in the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
