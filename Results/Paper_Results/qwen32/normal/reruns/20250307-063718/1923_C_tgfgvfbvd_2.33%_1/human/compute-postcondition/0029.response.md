The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. Therefore, after the execution, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
