### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a given subarray of an array `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. The conditions are:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

For a subarray to be "good", the sum of its elements must be at least twice the number of elements in the subarray (i.e., `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`), because if this condition is met, we can construct an array `b` where each element is at least 1 greater than the corresponding element in the subarray, ensuring that all elements in `b` are positive and distinct from the subarray's elements.

The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and then, for each query, calculates the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b`. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If this condition is satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program aligns with the problem's requirements. The cumulative sum array `p` is used efficiently to quickly compute the sum of any subarray, and the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is correctly applied to determine if the subarray is "good".

### Correctness:
**True**
