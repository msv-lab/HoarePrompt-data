Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met.**

In simpler terms: **The condition is met if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, where `s` is calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` is `p[b - 1]`. All variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values and relationships as described in the precondition.**
