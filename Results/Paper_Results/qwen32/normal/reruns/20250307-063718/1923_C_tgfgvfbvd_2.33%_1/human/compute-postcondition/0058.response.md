The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`**
