The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `x`. Therefore, `c` becomes `n + x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c` is `n + x`; `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**
