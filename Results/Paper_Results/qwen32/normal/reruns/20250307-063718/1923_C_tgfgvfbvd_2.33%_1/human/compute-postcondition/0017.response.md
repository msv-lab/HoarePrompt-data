The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Since `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `b` is an integer, the value of `s` will be the cumulative sum up to, but not including, the `b`-th element of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`.**
