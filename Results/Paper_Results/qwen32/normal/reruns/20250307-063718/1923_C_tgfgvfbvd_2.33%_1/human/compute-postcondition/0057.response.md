To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `l` and updates the variables `p` and `c`.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`. For each element, it does the following:
1. Adds the current element `x` to the cumulative sum `c`.
2. Appends the updated cumulative sum `c` to the list `p`.

Let's break down the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, not modifies it.
- `p` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` after the loop completes.

Given the above logic, the final output state after the loop completes can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` stays the same.
- `n` and `m` stay the same.
- `l` stays the same.
- `p` becomes a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` becomes the total sum of all elements in `l`.
