The provided code snippet contains a `print('YES')` statement. According to the initial state, several variables are defined and manipulated, but the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
3. `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
5. `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
6. `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
7. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.
8. A condition is checked: If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met.

However, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on whether the condition is met or not. It will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, or any other variable.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
