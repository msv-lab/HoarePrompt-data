The code snippet provided updates the list `l` to be a new list of integers obtained from the input. The variables `n`, `m`, `p`, and `c` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the original `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`.**
