Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program executes the if block; otherwise, it executes the else block, but in both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
