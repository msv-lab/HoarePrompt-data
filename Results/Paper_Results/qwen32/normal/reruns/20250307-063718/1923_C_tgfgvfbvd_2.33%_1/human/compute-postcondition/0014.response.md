To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`. For each element, it adds the value of `x` to the cumulative sum `c` and appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize the final state after all iterations:

1. **Variable `t`**: Remains unchanged as it's not affected by the loop.
2. **Variables `n` and `m`**: Remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
3. **Variable `l`**: The list `l` remains unchanged; it is the source of the values that are processed in the loop.
4. **Variable `p`**: This list will contain the cumulative sums after each iteration. Specifically, `p[i]` will be the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.
5. **Variable `c`**: This will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` after the loop completes.

Let's denote the elements of list `l` as `l[0], l[1], ..., l[k-1]`, where `k` is the length of `l`. After the loop completes, `c` will be `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[k-1]`, and `p` will be `[l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[k-1]]`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
