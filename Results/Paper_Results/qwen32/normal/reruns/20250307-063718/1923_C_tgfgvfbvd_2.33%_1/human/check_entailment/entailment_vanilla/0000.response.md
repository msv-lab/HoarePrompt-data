Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l:r+1]` of an array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c[l:r+1]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in `c[l:r+1]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `c`. This is done using the following lines:
     ```python
     p = []
     c = 0
     for x in l:
         c += x
         p.append(c)
     ```
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l:r+1]` using `p[r] - p[l-1]` for `l > 0`, or just `p[r]` for `l = 0`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` (inclusive) of the subarray `c[a:b+1]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `c[a:b+1]` using the prefix sum array:
     ```python
     s = p[b - 1]
     if a - 2 >= 0:
         s -= p[a - 2]
     ```
   - It then checks if the subarray can be "good" based on the condition:
     ```python
     if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
         print('YES')
     else:
         print('NO')
     ```
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for the existence of a different array `b` that meets the criteria.
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for the construction of an array `b` where each element is strictly greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `c[a:b+1]`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Condition Analysis:**
  - If `b - a + 1 > 1`, it means the subarray has more than one element.
  - The sum `s` of the subarray must be at least `2 * (b - a + 1)` to ensure that we can construct an array `b` where each element is strictly greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `c[a:b+1]`. This is because the smallest possible sum for such an array `b` is `b - a + 1` (all elements being 1), and we need to ensure that the sum of `b` can be `s` while also ensuring that `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the subarray has only one element (`b - a + 1 == 1`), it cannot be "good" because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with a single element that is strictly greater than 0 and different from `c[a]`.
  - If the sum `s` of the subarray is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`, it is impossible to construct such an array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
