The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers with the condition `b - a + 1 > 1`.
- `s` is calculated based on the indices `a` and `b` from the list `p`, with a specific condition for `a`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
