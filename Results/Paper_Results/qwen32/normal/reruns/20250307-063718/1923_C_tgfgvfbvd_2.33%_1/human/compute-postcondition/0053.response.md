The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Before the execution, `p` contains the second element of the list `l`. After the execution, `p` will contain the second element of `l` followed by the value of `c`.

Given:
- `c` is the second element of `l` plus `x`.
- `p` initially contains the second element of `l`.

After appending `c` to `p`, `p` will have two elements: the second element of `l` and the second element of `l` plus `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `p` is a list containing the second element of `l` and the second element of `l` plus `x`; `c` is the second element of `l` plus `x`.**
