You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of the specified range in the array is at least twice the length of that range. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the condition for a subarray to be "good" is not fully considered in the code. The code checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is not sufficient to ensure that there exists an integer array `b` such that all elements of `b` are positive, different from the corresponding elements in `a`, and the sum of `b` equals the sum of `a`.

Let's consider a specific test case:

### Test Case:
```
1
4 1
2 2 2 2
1 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
NO
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
For the subarray `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, the sum is 8. To form a valid array `b` where each `b_i > 0`, `b_i != a_i`, and the sum of `b` is also 8, we need to find four positive integers that are not equal to 2 (since all elements in the subarray are 2) and sum up to 8. This is impossible because the smallest possible values for `b_i` would be 1, and even if we use four 1s, the sum would be 4, which is less than 8. Any other combination of numbers greater than 1 and different from 2 would result in a sum greater than 8.

### Program's Output:
The program would output `YES` for this case because the sum of the subarray (8) is indeed greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray (2 * 4 = 8). However, this does not guarantee the existence of a valid array `b` as per the problem constraints.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" in all cases.
