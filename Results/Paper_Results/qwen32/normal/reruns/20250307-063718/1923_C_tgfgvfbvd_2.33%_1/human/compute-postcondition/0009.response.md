The code snippet `c += x` updates the value of `c` by adding `x` to it. The value of `c` was initially set to `x`, and now it will be updated to `x + x` or `2 * x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `p` is a list containing the value of `x`; `c` is `2 * x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
