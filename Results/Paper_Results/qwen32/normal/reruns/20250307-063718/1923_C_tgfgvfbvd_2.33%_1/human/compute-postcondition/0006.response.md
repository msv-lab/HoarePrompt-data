The given code snippet is `c += x`. This line of code increments the variable `c` by the value of `x`. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `x`. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific new value for `c` without knowing `x`. 

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we can only express the new value of `c` in terms of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is an empty list; `c` is 0 + `x`.**
