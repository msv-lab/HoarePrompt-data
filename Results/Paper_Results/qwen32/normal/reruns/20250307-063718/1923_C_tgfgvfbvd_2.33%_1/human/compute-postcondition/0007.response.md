The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `p` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `p` will contain one element, which is the value of `c`. The value of `c` is specified as `0 + x`, but since the value of `x` is not given, `c` is effectively `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the value of `x`; `c` is `x`.**
