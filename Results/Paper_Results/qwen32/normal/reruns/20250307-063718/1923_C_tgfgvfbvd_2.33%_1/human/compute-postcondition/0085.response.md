Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met, and 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `m` iterations, the program has processed `m` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`) provided by the user. For each pair, it calculates a sum `s` based on the cumulative sums list `p`, and then checks if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state except that the loop has completed all its iterations.
