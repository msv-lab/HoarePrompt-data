Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each of the `m` iterations, the following conditions are checked: `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the loop prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met, and 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, l is a list of integers read from the input, p is a list of cumulative sums of l, c is the sum of all elements in l. The loop has executed m times, and for each iteration, a and b are the integers read from the input. If a - 2 >= 0, s is p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]; otherwise, s is p[b - 1]. The program prints 'YES' if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of t, n, m, l, p, and c remain unchanged after the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
