Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, and `s` is `p[b - 1]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
