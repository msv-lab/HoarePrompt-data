The code snippet `p = []` reassigns the variable `p` to an empty list. This means that the previous list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list `l` is discarded, and `p` is now an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`.**
