Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is the first integer from the input; m is the second integer from the input; l is a list of integers read from the input; p is a list of cumulative sums of l; c is the sum of all elements in l.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is true; otherwise, it is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program executes the if block; otherwise, it executes the else block, but in both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
