The code snippet provided modifies the variable `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, `s` is initially equal to `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` will be equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m - 1` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m - 1` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` is now the difference between the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element and the cumulative sum up to the element just before the `a`-th element in the list `p`.
