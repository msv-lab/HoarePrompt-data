The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `n + x` and `x` is the second element in the list `l`, the list `p` will now contain two elements: the original `n` and the new value `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the elements `n` and `c`; `c` is `n + x`; `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**
