The code snippet `c += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `c`. Given the initial state, `c` is initially the second element of `l` plus `x`. After the operation, `c` will be the second element of `l` plus `x` plus `x`, which simplifies to the second element of `l` plus `2*x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `p` is a list containing the second element of `l` and the second element of `l` plus `x`; `c` is the second element of `l` plus `2*x`; `x` is the next element in `l`.**
