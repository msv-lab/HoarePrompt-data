The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this line, nor are the variables `p` and `c` until they are recalculated based on the new list `l`. Since the new list `l` is read from the input, we do not have specific values for `l` but we know it is a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`; `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.**
