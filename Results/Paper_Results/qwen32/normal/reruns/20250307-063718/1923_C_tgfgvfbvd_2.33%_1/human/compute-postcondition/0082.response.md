Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m - 1` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m - 1` is the second integer and must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `'YES'` and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables defined in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
