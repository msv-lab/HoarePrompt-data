The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. 

Given that `s` was initially `p[b - 1]`, after the operation, the new value of `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, and `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
