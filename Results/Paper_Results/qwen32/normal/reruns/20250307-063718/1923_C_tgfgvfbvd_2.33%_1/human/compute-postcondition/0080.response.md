The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. The initial state indicates that `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m - 1` are integers where `n` is the first integer and `m - 1` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
