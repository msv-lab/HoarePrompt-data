The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the list `l`. Therefore, the state of the list `l` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

For the loop to execute at least once, the list `l` must contain at least one element. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, and `c` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is an empty list; `c` is 0**
