The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current element in the list `l`, and `l` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least one more element after `x`.

Since `p` is a list containing the values of `x` and `2 * x`, and `c` is `2 * x`, these values are derived from `x` and will be recalculated in the next iteration when `x` takes the next value from `l`.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `x` to be the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 more element; `p` is a list containing the values of `x` and `2 * x`; `c` is `2 * x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
