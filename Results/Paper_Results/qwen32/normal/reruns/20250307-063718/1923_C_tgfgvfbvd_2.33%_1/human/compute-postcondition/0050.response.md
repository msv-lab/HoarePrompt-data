The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `p` was initially an empty list and `c` is `x`, after the execution of the code, `p` will contain one element, which is the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing the single element `x`; `c` is `x`.**
