To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `c` and `p` based on the list `l`.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `c` is initialized to 0.
  - `p` is initialized as an empty list.

- **Loop Body**:
  - For each element `x` in `l`, the loop does two things:
    1. It adds `x` to `c`, i.e., `c += x`.
    2. It appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`, i.e., `p.append(c)`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First iteration**: `c` becomes `l[0]` and `p` becomes `[l[0]]`.
- **Second iteration**: `c` becomes `l[0] + l[1]` and `p` becomes `[l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`.
- **Third iteration**: `c` becomes `l[0] + l[1] + l[2]` and `p` becomes `[l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2]]`.

### Generalization:
- After the `i`-th iteration, `c` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, and `p` contains the cumulative sums up to each element.

### Final State:
- After all iterations (i.e., when the loop has processed all elements in `l`), `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `p` will be a list of cumulative sums, where each element at index `i` in `p` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `l` remains the list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is the first integer from the input; m is the second integer from the input; l is a list of integers read from the input; p is a list of cumulative sums of l; c is the sum of all elements in l.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`, and `p` will contain the running totals after each element of `l` is added.
