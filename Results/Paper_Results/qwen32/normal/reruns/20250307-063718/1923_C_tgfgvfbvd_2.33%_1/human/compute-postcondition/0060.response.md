The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Based on the initial state, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, and `b` is an integer obtained from the input. Therefore, `s` will hold the value of the cumulative sum up to the index `b-1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
