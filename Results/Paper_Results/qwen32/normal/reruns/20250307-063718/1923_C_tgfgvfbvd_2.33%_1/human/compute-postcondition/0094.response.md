The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `l`. Since `l` is a list that must have at least one element, and `x` is an element from `l`, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in the list for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, and assuming that `x` was the first element in the previous iteration, `x` should now be the second element in the list. If `l` has more than one element, the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c` is `n`; `x` is the second element in the list `l`**
