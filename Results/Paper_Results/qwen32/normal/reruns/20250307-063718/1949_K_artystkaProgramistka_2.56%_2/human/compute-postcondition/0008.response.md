To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the `distribute_number(num)` function. Since the function `distribute_number(num)` is not provided, we will assume it follows a logical distribution strategy based on the context given. A common strategy would be to distribute the number to the group with the smallest current sum to balance the sums of the groups.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a` contains the first number from `numbers`.
- `group_b` contains the second number from `numbers`.
- `group_c` is an empty list.
- `sum_a` is the first number from `numbers`.
- `sum_b` is the second number from `numbers`.
- `sum_c` is 0.
- `num` is the third number from `numbers`.

Let's assume that `distribute_number(num)` adds `num` to the group with the smallest sum (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c`).

Since `sum_c` is 0 and `sum_a` and `sum_b` are positive, `sum_c` is the smallest. Therefore, `num` will be added to `group_c`, and `sum_c` will be updated to `num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first number from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the second number from `numbers`, `group_c` contains the third number from `numbers`, `sum_a` is the first number from `numbers`, `sum_b` is the second number from `numbers`, `sum_c` is the third number from `numbers`, `num` is the third number from `numbers`.**
