The code sorts the list `numbers` in descending order. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged. The list `numbers` is now ordered such that the largest numbers come first.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.**
