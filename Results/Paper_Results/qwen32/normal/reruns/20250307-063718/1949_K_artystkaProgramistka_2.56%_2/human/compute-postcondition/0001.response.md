The provided Python code snippet initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. None of the existing variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`) are modified by this code. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variables `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` which are now empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are empty lists.**
