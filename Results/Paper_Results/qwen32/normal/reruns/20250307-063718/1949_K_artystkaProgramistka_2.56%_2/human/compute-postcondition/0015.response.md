Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, and a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list in descending order and attempts to split it into three groups: `group_a` containing the first `na` numbers, `group_b` containing the next `nb` numbers, and `group_c` containing the last `nc` numbers. If a certain condition (checked by `func_1`) is satisfied with the sums of these groups, it returns a tuple ('YES', `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`). Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
