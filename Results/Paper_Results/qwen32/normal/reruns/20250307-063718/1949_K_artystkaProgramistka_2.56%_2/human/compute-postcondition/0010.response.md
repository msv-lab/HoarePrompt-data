Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` contains the first `na` numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` numbers from `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` numbers from `numbers`; `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` numbers from `numbers`, `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` numbers from `numbers`, `sum_c` is the sum of the last `nc` numbers from `numbers`. Additionally, `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
