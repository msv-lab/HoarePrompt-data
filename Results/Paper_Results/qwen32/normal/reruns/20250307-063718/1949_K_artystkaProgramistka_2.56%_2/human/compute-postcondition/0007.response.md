The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `numbers`. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `numbers`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a` contains the first number from `numbers`.
- `group_b` contains the second number from `numbers`.
- `group_c` is an empty list.
- `sum_a` is the first number from `numbers`.
- `sum_b` is the second number from `numbers`.
- `sum_c` is 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` would have been the second element in `numbers` (since `group_a` and `sum_a` are initialized with the first element, and `group_b` and `sum_b` with the second element).

For the next iteration, `num` should be the third element in `numbers`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first number from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the second number from `numbers`, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is the first number from `numbers`, `sum_b` is the second number from `numbers`, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third number from `numbers`**
