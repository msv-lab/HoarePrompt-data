In the provided loop, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `num`. However, `num` is an iteration variable that takes on the values of the elements in the `numbers` list one by one during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of `num` itself cannot be directly adjusted before the loop starts, as it is determined by the elements of the `numbers` list.

Given the loop head `for num in numbers:`, the only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the `numbers` list itself. The loop will execute if and only if `numbers` is not empty.

Since the problem statement already specifies that `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, and `n` is a positive integer, the list `numbers` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute.

However, to adhere strictly to the format and the requirement to only adjust states in the loop head, we can confirm that the loop will execute as long as `numbers` is not empty, which is already ensured by the given state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
