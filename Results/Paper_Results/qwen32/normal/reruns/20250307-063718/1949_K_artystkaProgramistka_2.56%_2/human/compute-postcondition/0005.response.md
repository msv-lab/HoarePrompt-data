The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If there are more numbers in the list `numbers`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the first number from `numbers`, and now we need to move to the next number in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` contains the first number from `numbers`, `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a` is the first number from `numbers`, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0; `num` is the second number from `numbers`**
