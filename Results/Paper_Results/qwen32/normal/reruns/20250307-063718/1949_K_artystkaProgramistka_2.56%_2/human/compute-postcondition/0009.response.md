Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` contains the first `na` numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` numbers from `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` numbers from `numbers`; `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` numbers from `numbers`, `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` numbers from `numbers`, `sum_c` is the sum of the last `nc` numbers from `numbers`.`**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, `group_a` will have the first `na` largest numbers from the `numbers` list, `group_b` will have the next `nb` largest numbers, and `group_c` will have the last `nc` numbers. The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` will be the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively.
