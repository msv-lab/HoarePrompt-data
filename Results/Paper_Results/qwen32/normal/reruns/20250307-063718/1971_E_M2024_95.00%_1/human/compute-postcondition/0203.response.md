Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, where `k` is the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`, and `q` is the number of queries. The list `a` contains `k` distinct integers in increasing order, with the last element being `n`. The list `b` contains `k` distinct integers in increasing order. For each query, the function receives an integer `d` and returns a value based on the conditions defined by the lists `a` and `b`. If `d` is less than the first element of `a`, the function returns the first element of `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, the function returns the last element of `b`. Otherwise, the function finds the largest index `i` such that `a_i <= d` and returns `b_i`.**
