Let's break down the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Final destination.
     - `k`: Number of known points (excluding 0 and `n`).
     - `q`: Number of queries.
     - `a`: List of `k+1` points (including 0 and `n`).
     - `b`: Corresponding times when the car reaches each point in `a`.
     - `q` queries, each a distance `d` from 0 to `n`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, output the time it takes to reach point `d`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

3. **Logic:**
   - For each segment between two consecutive points in `a`, compute the speed.
   - For each query `d`, find the segment `d` falls into.
   - Calculate the exact time it takes to reach point `d` using the speed of that segment.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Read `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, read `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - Read the list of points `a` and prepend `0` to it.
   - Read the list of times `b` and prepend `0` to it.
   - Compute the distances between consecutive points in `a` and store them in `ad`.
   - Compute the time intervals between consecutive points in `b` and store them in `bd`.
   - Compute the speed for each segment and store them in `v`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`:
     - Find the segment `d` falls into using `bisect_left`.
     - If `d` is exactly at a known point, output the corresponding time from `b`.
     - Otherwise, compute the exact time to reach `d` using the speed of the segment and the distance from the start of the segment to `d`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each query, print the computed time rounded down.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly initializes all necessary lists (`a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`).
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the correct segment is found efficiently.
- The calculation of the time to reach `d` within a segment is accurate.
- The output is formatted correctly with spaces between values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases, such as queries at known points and within segments, and outputs the results as specified.

**Correctness: True**
