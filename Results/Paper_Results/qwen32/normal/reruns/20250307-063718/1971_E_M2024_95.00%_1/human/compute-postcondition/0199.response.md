To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` is set to `1`.
- `q` is greater than `0`.
- `l` is set to `2`.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is derived from the final input value from the last iteration, adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[s - 1]`, adding a new integer input, and then subtracting `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
- `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input.
- `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input.
- `ad` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are calculated as the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are calculated as the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

### Calculation of `m`:
The value of `m` is calculated as:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * \frac{ql}{ad[s]} \]

Where:
- `b[s - 1]` is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.
- `bd[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `bd`.
- `ql` is the calculated value based on the input and previous values.
- `ad[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `ad`.

### Calculation of `ql`:
The value of `ql` is calculated as:
\[ ql = \text{(final input value from the last iteration)} - 2 * a[s - 1] + \text{(new integer input)} - a[s - 1] \]

Given the complexity and the dependencies on the inputs and previous calculations, we can only describe the value of `m` in terms of the variables and the input values.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`, which is calculated based on the above formula.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
