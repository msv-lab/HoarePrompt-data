The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `v`, `i`, `q`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, or `l` are affected by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is 2**.
