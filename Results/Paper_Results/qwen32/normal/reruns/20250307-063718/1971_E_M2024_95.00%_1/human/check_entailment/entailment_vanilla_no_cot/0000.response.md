Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly handles the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, the list `a`, the list `b`, and the queries.

2. **Distance and Time Differences Calculation**: It calculates the differences between consecutive points in `a` and `b` to determine the distances and time intervals between the known points. This is stored in `ad` and `bd` respectively.

3. **Speed Calculation**: Using the distance and time differences, it calculates the speed of the car between each pair of consecutive points and stores it in `v`.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it finds the appropriate segment where the query point falls (using binary search with `bisect_left`). If the query point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly returns the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time it takes to reach the query point based on the speed in the segment and the distance from the start of the segment.

5. **Output**: The results for each query are printed in the required format.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
