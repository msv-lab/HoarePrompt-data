Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least two elements (e.g., `[0, x]` where `x` is an integer from the input), `q` is the third input integer, `l` is the previous value of `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `ad`, which now includes the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
