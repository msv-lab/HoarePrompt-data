Postcondition: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is 3. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program executes the if block; otherwise, no changes occur.**
