To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `bd` list. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the `b` list, appending the difference between consecutive elements of `b` to `bd`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until it has processed all elements of `b`. If `b` has `len(b)` elements, the loop will run `len(b) - 1` times (since it starts at 1 and goes to `len(b) - 1`).

Let's summarize the loop's effect:
- Initially, `bd` is `[0]`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `bd` becomes `[0, b[1] - b[0]]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `bd` becomes `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `bd` becomes `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, `bd` will be:
`[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`.

Since `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, the length of `b` is `len(a)`, and the loop will run `len(a) - 1` times. Therefore, the final state of `bd` will be:
`[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(a) - 1] - b[len(a) - 2]]`.

Given that `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1` is equivalent to `a[i] - a[i - 1]` (since `b[i]` is the same as `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`), the final state of `bd` is:
`[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`.

This is exactly the same as the `ad` list, which is defined as:
`ad = [0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`.

Thus, the final state of `bd` will be the same as `ad`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `bd` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input, `q` is the third input integer, `l` is the previous value of `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`**

In natural language, after all iterations, the `bd` list will be the same as the `ad` list, which contains the differences between consecutive elements of the `a` list, starting with a `0`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial definitions or last computed values.
