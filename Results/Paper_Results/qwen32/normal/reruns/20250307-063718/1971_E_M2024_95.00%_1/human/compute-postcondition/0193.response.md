To determine the output of the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and derive the value of `b[s]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding List `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the input.
   - `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the new input.

2. **Understanding List `ad` and `bd`:**
   - `ad` contains differences between consecutive elements in `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`.
   - `bd` contains differences between consecutive elements in `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`.

3. **Understanding List `v`:**
   - `v` is a list containing `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.

4. **Variables `i`, `q`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `n`, `k`:**
   - `i` is initialized to `1`.
   - `q` is greater than `0`.
   - `l` is initialized to `2`.
   - `m` is initialized to `0`.
   - `ql` is calculated as the final input value from the last iteration minus `2 * a[s - 1]` plus the new integer input.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.

### Focus on `b[s]`:

The value of `b[s]` depends on the value of `s`, which is determined by the insertion point of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

- `ql` is calculated as the final input value from the last iteration minus `2 * a[s - 1]` plus the new integer input.
- `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `ql`, and `s` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `b[s]` in terms of the structure of the lists and the calculation of `s`.

### Conclusion:

The value of `b[s]` will be the element in the list `b` at the index `s`, where `s` is the position determined by the insertion of `ql` into the sorted list `a`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql would be inserted in the sorted list a, and ql is calculated as the final input value from the last iteration minus 2 * a[s - 1] plus the new integer input)**
