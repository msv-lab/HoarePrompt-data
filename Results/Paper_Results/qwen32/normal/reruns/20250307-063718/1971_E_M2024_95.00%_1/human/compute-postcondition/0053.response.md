To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the value of the variable `m` based on the given initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the relevant parts of the initial state:

1. `b` is a list.
2. `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements, where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`.
3. `a` is a list with at least 2 elements.
4. `q` is greater than 0.
5. `m` is calculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
6. `i` is 1.
7. `ql` is the user input minus `a[s - 1]`.
8. `s` is the index of `ql` in `a`.
9. `l` is 2.

However, there are a few missing pieces of information:
- `ad` is not defined in the initial state.
- The initial value of `m` is not provided.
- The exact value of `q` and the user input to calculate `ql` are not provided.

Despite these missing details, we can express `m` in terms of the known variables and the formula provided.

The formula for `m` is:
\[ m = m + b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

Given that the initial value of `m` is not specified, let's denote it as `m_initial`. Therefore, after the calculation, `m` will be:
\[ m = m_{\text{initial}} + b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

Since `ql` is the user input minus `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index of `ql` in `a`, we can denote the user input as `user_input`. Thus:
\[ ql = \text{user\_input} - a[s - 1] \]

And `s` is the index where `a[s - 1]` is the closest element to `user_input` in the list `a`.

Therefore, the value of `m` can be expressed as:
\[ m = m_{\text{initial}} + b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times (\text{user\_input} - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \]

Since we don't have the exact values for `m_initial`, `user_input`, `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad`, we can only describe the value of `m` in terms of these variables.

Output: **m (where m is calculated as m_initial + b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (user_input - a[s - 1])) / ad[s])**
