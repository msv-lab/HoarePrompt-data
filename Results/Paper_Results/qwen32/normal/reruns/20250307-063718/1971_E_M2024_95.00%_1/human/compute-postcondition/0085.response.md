The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from `1` to `len(b) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[1] - b[0]]`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input, `q` is the third input integer, `l` is the previous value of `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is `2`, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`**
