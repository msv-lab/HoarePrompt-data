### Reasoning:

The provided Python program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a car's journey from point 0 to point `n` with known times at intermediate points. The program calculates the time taken to reach a series of queried points based on the known times and positions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `k+1` points and the list `b` of `k+1` times. The list `a` is extended to include the starting point `0` and the final point `n`, and the list `b` is extended to include the starting time `0` and the final time `b_k`.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and stores them in `ad`.
   - It calculates the time intervals between consecutive times in `b` and stores them in `bd`.
   - Using these distances and time intervals, it calculates the speed for each segment and stores them in `v`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first index `s` in `a` where `a[s]` is not less than `d`.
   - If `d` exactly matches `a[s]`, the program outputs `b[s]` as the time.
   - If `d` is not exactly a known point, the program calculates the additional time required to reach `d` from the last known point `a[s-1]` using the speed `v[s]` and adds it to the time `b[s-1]` to get the total time.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Time Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the speed for each segment using the formula `speed = distance / time`.
  - It correctly calculates the additional time required to reach a query point `d` from the last known point using the speed for that segment.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the query point `d` is exactly a known point by directly returning the corresponding time.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the query point `d` is between two known points by calculating the additional time required to reach `d` from the last known point.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant segment for each query, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input parsing, speed calculation, and query processing efficiently and accurately.

**Correctness: True**
