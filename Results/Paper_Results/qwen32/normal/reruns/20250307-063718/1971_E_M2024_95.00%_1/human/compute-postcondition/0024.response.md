The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `range(1, len(a))`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to compute `v` as `[0, a[i] / bd[i]]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the bounds of the range `range(1, len(a))`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` was 1 in the previous iteration (since the range starts at 1), so now `i` should be 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `a`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[i] / bd[i]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
