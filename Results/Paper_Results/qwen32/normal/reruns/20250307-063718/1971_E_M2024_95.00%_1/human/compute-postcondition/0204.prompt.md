You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5. a is a list of k integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, and a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. For each query, d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ad = [0]
        
        bd = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        
        print()
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, all queries have been answered. The final output consists of the results of all queries for all test cases, each printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, where `k` is the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`, and `q` is the number of queries. The list `a` contains `k` distinct integers in increasing order, with the last element being `n`. The list `b` contains `k` distinct integers in increasing order. For each query, the function receives an integer `d` and returns a value based on the conditions defined by the lists `a` and `b`. If `d` is less than the first element of `a`, the function returns the first element of `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, the function returns the last element of `b`. Otherwise, the function finds the largest index `i` such that `a_i <= d` and returns `b_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
