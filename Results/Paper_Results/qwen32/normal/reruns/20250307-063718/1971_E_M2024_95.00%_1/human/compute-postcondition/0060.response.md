The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since no loop is explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement by itself does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is 3**.
