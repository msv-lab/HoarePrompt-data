The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or alter the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, the values of `v`, `i`, `q`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is 3`**
