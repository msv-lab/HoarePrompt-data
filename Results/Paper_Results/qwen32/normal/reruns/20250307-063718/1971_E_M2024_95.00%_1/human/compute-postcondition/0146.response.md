The code snippet `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of list `a` to list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element to be appended to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`.

The initial state includes the following:
- `v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`
- `i` is 3
- `q` is the third integer from the input
- `l` is the third integer from the input
- `m` is the final calculated value of `m` from the last iteration
- `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration
- `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order after the last iteration
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one integer from the input
- `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input
- `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`
- `bd` is `[0]`
- `len(a)` must be greater than 3

After executing the code snippet, `ad` will have an additional element `a[3] - a[2]` appended to it.

Output State: **`v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `i` is 3; `q` is the third integer from the input; `l` is the third integer from the input; `m` is the final calculated value of `m` from the last iteration; `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration; `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order after the last iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one integer from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input; `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`; `bd` is `[0]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 3**.
