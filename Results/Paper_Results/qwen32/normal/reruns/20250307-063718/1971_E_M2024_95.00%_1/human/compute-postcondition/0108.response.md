To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
1. `v` is a list defined as `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
2. `i` is set to 1.
3. `q` is greater than 0.
4. `m` is calculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
5. `ql` is defined as an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
6. `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the integer value of `m` followed by a space.
- The value of `m` is determined by the formula `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- Since the exact values of `m`, `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`.
- However, we can describe `m` based on the given formula.

### Output Description:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space. The value of `m` is calculated using the formula `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
