To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State and Given Information
- **`t`** is any value (not relevant to the print statement).
- **`b`** is a list.
- **`bd`** is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements, where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`.
- **`v`** is a list calculated as `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`.
- **`a`** is a list with at least 2 elements.
- **`q`** must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the print statement).
- **`m`** is 0 (not relevant to the print statement).
- **`i`** is 1 (not relevant to the print statement).
- **`ql`** is an input integer.
- **`s`** is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Analysis
- We are asked to print `b[s]`.
- From the initial state, we know that `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
- It is also given that `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

However, the key piece of information here is that `s` is used as an index to access an element in the list `b`. The value of `b[s]` depends on the actual value of `s` and the contents of `b`.

Since the exact contents of `b` and the value of `s` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output
Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql would be inserted into a to maintain sorted order, and a[s] is equal to ql)**
