Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, all queries have been answered. The final output consists of the results of all queries for all test cases, each printed on a new line.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program has handled every test case and query as specified. For each test case, it has computed and printed the answers to all queries, ensuring that the output reflects the results of each query in the order they were given.
