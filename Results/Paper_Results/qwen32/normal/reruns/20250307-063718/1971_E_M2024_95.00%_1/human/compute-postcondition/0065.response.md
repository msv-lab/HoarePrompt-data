To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Any value (not explicitly used in the print statement).
2. **`b`**: A list.
3. **`bd`**: A list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`.
4. **`v`**: A list defined as `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`.
5. **`a`**: A list with at least 2 elements.
6. **`q`**: Greater than 0.
7. **`m`**: Defined as `b[s - 1] + ql`.
8. **`i`**: Set to 1 (not explicitly used in the print statement).
9. **`ql`**: Defined as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
10. **`s`**: The index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.
11. **`l`**: Set to 3 (not explicitly used in the print statement).

### Key Variables for the Print Statement:
- **`m`**: This is the variable that will be printed. It is defined as `b[s - 1] + ql`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - This means `a[s - 1] < ql <= a[s]` if `s > 0` and `ql <= a[0]` if `s == 0`.

2. **Determine `m`**:
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + ql`.
   - We know `ql` is a value that has been adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it.
   - Therefore, `m` can be thought of as the sum of the element in `b` at the position just before where `ql` would fit in `a`, plus the adjusted `ql`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + ql, with s being the index where ql would be inserted in a to maintain sorted order)**
