Postcondition: **`v` is a list containing `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`. `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]` updated to the new input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`. If `a[s] == ql`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.**

Since there is no change in the variables whether the condition `a[s] == ql` is true or false, the postcondition reflects the unchanged state of all variables.
