To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Variables and Their Definitions:
- **`v`**: A list where each element is calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- **`i`**: Set to 1.
- **`q`**: Greater than 0 (the exact value is not specified).
- **`l`**: Set to 1.
- **`m`**: Calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- **`ql`**: The final input value from the last iteration minus `2 * a[s - 1]`.
- **`s`**: The index where `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- **`n`**: The first integer from the input.
- **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
- **`a`**: A list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input.
- **`b`**: A list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input.
- **`ad`**: A list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `0`.
- **`bd`**: A list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `0`.

### Calculation of `m`:
The variable `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **`s`**: This is the index where `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `a[s - 1] <= ql < a[s]`.
2. **`ql`**: This is the final input value from the last iteration minus `2 * a[s - 1]`.
3. **`b[s - 1]`**: This is the element in `b` at the index `s - 1`.
4. **`bd[s]`**: This is the difference between `b[s]` and `b[s - 1]`.
5. **`ad[s]`**: This is the difference between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`.

### Putting It Together:
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s]`.
- Since `ql` is `final_input - 2 * a[s - 1]`, and `s` is determined by the sorted insertion of `ql` in `a`, the exact value of `m` depends on the values of `b`, `a`, and the final input value.

### Output:
Given the information, the exact numerical value of `m` cannot be determined without the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the final input value. However, the structure of the calculation is clear.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s], with s being the insertion index of ql in a, and ql being the final input value minus 2 * a[s - 1])**
