The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function to find the index in list `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. This does not change the values of `t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `a`, `q`, `m`, `i`, or `ql`; it only introduces the new variable `s` with the calculated index.

Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.**
