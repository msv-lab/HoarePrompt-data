The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql` before the subtraction, `l` is 2**
