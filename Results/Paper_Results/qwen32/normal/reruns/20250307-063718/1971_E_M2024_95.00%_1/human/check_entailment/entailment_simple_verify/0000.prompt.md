You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, and the number of queries `q`.
3. Reading the points `a` and corresponding times `b`.
4. Calculating the distances between consecutive points and the corresponding time intervals.
5. Computing the speed between each pair of consecutive points.
6. For each query, determining the time taken to reach the queried point `d` by:
   - Finding the segment in which `d` lies.
   - Calculating the time taken to reach `d` based on the speed in that segment.
7. Printing the results for each query.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - When `d` is exactly at one of the points `a_i`.
   - When `d` is very close to the boundaries (0 or `n`).
   - When `d` is at the start of a segment.

2. **Correctness of Speed Calculation:**
   - The speed between two points is correctly calculated as `(a[i] - a[i-1]) / (b[i] - b[i-1])`.

3. **Correctness of Time Calculation:**
   - The time to reach `d` is correctly calculated by adding the time taken to reach the previous point and the time taken to travel the remaining distance in the current segment.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the segment search is efficient.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to verify the correctness.

#### Example 1

Input:
```
4
10 1 3
10
10
0
6
7
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
6
4
2
7
1000000000 1 1
1000000000
1000000000
99999999
6 1 3
6
5
2
6
5
```

Output:
```
0 6 7 
5 4 2 5 
99999999 
1 5 4 
```

The program seems to produce the correct output for these examples.

#### Additional Test Cases

**Test Case 1:**
```
1
10 1 1
10
10
10
```
Expected Output: `10`
Explanation: The car reaches point 10 at minute 10.

**Test Case 2:**
```
1
10 2 3
4 10
4 7
2
4
10
```
Expected Output: `2 4 7`
Explanation: 
- At point 2, the car travels at 1 unit/min, so it takes 2 minutes.
- At point 4, the car reaches exactly at minute 4.
- At point 10, the car reaches exactly at minute 7.

**Test Case 3:**
```
1
10 2 3
4 10
4 7
5
6
7
```
Expected Output: `3 5 5`
Explanation: 
- At point 5, the car travels at 1 unit/min, so it takes 3 minutes.
- At point 6, the car travels at 2 units/min, so it takes 5 minutes.
- At point 7, the car travels at 2 units/min, so it takes 5 minutes.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears to handle the problem description correctly. The program correctly calculates the time taken to reach each queried point `d` based on the given points and times.

**Correctness: True**

The program handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the required times for each query.
