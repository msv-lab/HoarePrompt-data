The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 2, the difference `b[2] - b[1]` is calculated and added to the end of `bd`.

Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is updated to include `b[2] - b[1]` as its new last element, `i` is 2**.

In simple terms, the new last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`, and all other variables retain their initial states.
