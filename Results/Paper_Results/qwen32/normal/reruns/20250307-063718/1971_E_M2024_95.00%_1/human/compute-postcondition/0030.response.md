Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0**.

In this output state, the value of `m` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `a`, and `q`) retain their initial values and conditions.
