To determine the output of the print statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `m`, `int(m)`, and the overall context.

### Given Initial State:
- `v` is a list defined as `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is defined as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `l` is set to 2.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Analysis of `m`:
The variable `m` is calculated using the formula:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

To determine the exact value of `m`, we need the values of:
- `b[s - 1]`
- `bd[s]`
- `ql`
- `ad[s]`

From the initial state, we know `ql` is recalculated as:
\[ ql = ql - a[s - 1] \]

However, the exact numerical values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `m`.

### Converting `m` to `int(m)`:
The `int(m)` function will convert the floating-point value of `m` to an integer by truncating the decimal part.

### Final Output:
Since we do not have the exact numerical values for the components of `m`, we can only describe `m` in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s])**
