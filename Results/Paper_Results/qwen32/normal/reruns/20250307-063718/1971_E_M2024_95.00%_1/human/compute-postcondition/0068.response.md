The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in the state description. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations left. Since `_` does not influence the loop's continuation, we only need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that `t` represents the number of iterations left, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order**
