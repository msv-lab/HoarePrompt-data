To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `v` is a list defined as `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `l` is 3.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- The variable `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we can infer that `b` is a list, and `b[s]` refers to the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

To determine the output, we need to know the exact value of `b[s]`. Since `b` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the index `s` and the list `b`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql would be inserted in list a to maintain sorted order)**
