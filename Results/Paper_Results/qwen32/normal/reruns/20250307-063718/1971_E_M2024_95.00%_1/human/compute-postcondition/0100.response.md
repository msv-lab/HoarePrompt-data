Output State: **`v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `s` has been assigned the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` while keeping `a` sorted. The values of `v`, `i`, `q`, `m`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial state.
