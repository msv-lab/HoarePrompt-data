To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(int(m), end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **v**: A list defined as `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`. The exact values of `a` and `bd` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact values of the elements in `v`.
2. **i**: Set to 1.
3. **q**: Mentioned to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
4. **m**: Calculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`. The exact value of `m` is not provided, but it is being updated in this expression.
5. **ql**: Initially not explicitly defined, but it is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
6. **s**: The index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.
7. **l**: Set to 3.

### Key Focus:
The `print` statement specifically outputs `int(m)`. To determine what `int(m)` will be, we need to know the value of `m` after the update.

### Value of `m`:
The value of `m` is updated using the formula:
\[ m = m + b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

From the problem statement, we do not have the exact values of `b`, `bd`, `ql`, `ad`, and `s`. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe the value of `m` based on the given formula and the context.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer part of `m` after it has been updated according to the given formula. Since the exact values of the variables involved in the formula are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula.

Output: **int(m) (where m is updated to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
