### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the time it takes for a car to reach various points `d` on a number line, given the car's known positions and times at certain points.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - `n`, the final destination.
     - `k`, the number of known points.
     - `q`, the number of queries.
     - Two lists: `a` (known positions) and `b` (times at known positions).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The lists `a` and `b` are prepended with 0 to include the starting point.
   - `ad` and `bd` are initialized to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `v` is initialized to store the speeds between consecutive known points.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - For each interval between known points, the speed `v` is calculated as the distance divided by the time taken.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, the program determines which interval `d` falls into using `bisect_left`.
   - If `d` matches a known point, the corresponding time from `b` is printed.
   - If `d` is between two known points, the time to reach `d` is calculated using the speed of that interval and the time taken to reach the previous known point.

5. **Output:**
   - The results of all queries for each test case are printed on a single line, separated by spaces.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly parses all inputs as per the problem description.
  
- **Correctness of Speed Calculation:**
  - The speed `v` is correctly calculated as the distance between two points divided by the time taken to travel that distance.
  
- **Correctness of Query Processing:**
  - The program correctly identifies the interval in which `d` falls using `bisect_left`.
  - If `d` matches a known point, the corresponding time is directly retrieved from `b`.
  - If `d` is between two known points, the time to reach `d` is calculated correctly by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance at the calculated speed.
  
- **Output Format:**
  - The results are printed in the correct format, with each test case's results on a separate line.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases, such as when `d` matches a known point or falls between two known points.

**Correctness: True**
