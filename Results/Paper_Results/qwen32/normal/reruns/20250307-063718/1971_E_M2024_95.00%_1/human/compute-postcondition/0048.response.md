The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and there is no loop structure shown, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `a`, `q`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`, `l`) will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the index of `ql` in `a`, `l` is 2`.**
