### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem by processing each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and corresponding times the car reaches those positions, respectively.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the start to simplify the calculations.
   - It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` (denoted as `ad` and `bd`).
   - It calculates the speed `v` between each pair of consecutive points.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position in `a` where `d` would fit.
   - If `d` matches an element in `a`, it directly returns the corresponding time from `b`.
   - If `d` is between two elements in `a`, it calculates the time it takes to travel from the previous point to `d` based on the speed `v` and adds this to the time already elapsed to reach the previous point.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles the input parsing and initialization steps.
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the correct segment for each query.
- The calculation of time for queries between points is based on the speed between those points, which is correctly derived from the differences in positions and times.
- The output is formatted as required, with each test case's results printed on a new line and each query's result separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
