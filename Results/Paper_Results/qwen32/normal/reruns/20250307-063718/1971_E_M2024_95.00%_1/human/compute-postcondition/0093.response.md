Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one additional integer.
- `i` is `2`.
- `v` is a list with elements `a[1] / bd[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]` appended to it.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` to `3`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is greater than `3` so that `i` (which will be `3`) is still less than `len(a)`.

The state of `a` and `i` at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be `3`.
- `a` should be a list starting with `0` followed by at least two additional integers (so that `len(a)` is at least `3`).

The state of `v` is not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted in this context.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least two additional integers, `i` is `3`**.
