Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[2] / bd[2], a[2] / bd[2], a[3] / bd[3]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3`**

This means that the variable `v` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the result of `a[3] / bd[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
