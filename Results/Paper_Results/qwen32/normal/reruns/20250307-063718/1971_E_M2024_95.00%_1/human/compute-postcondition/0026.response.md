The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 for the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, and `a`) do not need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[2] / bd[2], a[2] / bd[2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**
