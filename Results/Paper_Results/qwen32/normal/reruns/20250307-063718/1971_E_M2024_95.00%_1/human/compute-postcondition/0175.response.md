To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the value of `m` based on the provided initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input.
   - `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `0`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `0`.

2. **Understanding `v`:**
   - `v` is a list where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are the ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd` (i.e., `ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(a) - 1`).

3. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order.

4. **Understanding `ql`:**
   - `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`.

5. **Understanding `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Given that the exact values of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `ql`, and `s` are not provided, we can describe `m` in terms of these variables.

The value of `m` is:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \cdot ql}{ad[s]} \]

Since `ql` is defined as the final input value from the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, we can substitute it in:
\[ ql = \text{(final input value from last iteration)} - a[s - 1] \]

Thus, `m` becomes:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \cdot (\text{(final input value from last iteration)} - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \]

Finally, the code prints the integer part of `m`:
\[ \text{print(int(m), end=' ')} \]

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `m` as calculated above.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (final input value from last iteration - a[s - 1])) / ad[s])**
