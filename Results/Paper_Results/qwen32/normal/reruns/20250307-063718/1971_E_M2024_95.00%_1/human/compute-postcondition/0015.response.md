The code appends the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `b` to the list `bd`. The values of `t` and the elements of `b` remain unchanged, but `bd` is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `bd` is updated to include `b[i] - b[i - 1]` as its new last element.**
