Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `ql`, which is now assigned the value of an integer input from the user. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
