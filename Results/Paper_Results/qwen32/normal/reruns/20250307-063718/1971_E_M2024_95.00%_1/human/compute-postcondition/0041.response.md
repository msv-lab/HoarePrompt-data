To determine the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: Any value (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `b`: A list of elements.
   - `bd`: A list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, with `len(bd) = len(b) - 1`.
   - `v`: A list where each element is the division of corresponding elements from `a` and `bd`, starting from the second element of `a`.
   - `a`: A list with at least 2 elements.
   - `q`: A value greater than 0 (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `m`: A value that is incremented by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `i`: An index set to 1.
   - `ql`: A value that is initially set to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s`: The index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - `a[s]`: Initially equal to `ql` before the subtraction.

2. **Identifying Relevant Information:**
   - The print statement specifically outputs the integer value of `m` followed by a space.
   - The value of `m` is calculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`. However, `ad` is not defined in the initial state, which suggests that `ad` might be a typo or a placeholder for another variable. Since `ad` is not defined, we will assume it is a typo and should be `bd` for the sake of this explanation.
   - Therefore, `m` is recalculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / bd[s]`.

3. **Simplifying the Calculation:**
   - The expression `bd[s] * ql / bd[s]` simplifies to `ql`.
   - Thus, `m` becomes `m + b[s - 1] + ql`.

4. **Final Output Description:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value of `m` after the calculation `m + b[s - 1] + ql`.

Given the information provided, the output will be the integer value of `m` after the described calculation.

### Final Output:
Output: **m (where m is the integer value of m after the calculation m + b[s - 1] + ql)**
