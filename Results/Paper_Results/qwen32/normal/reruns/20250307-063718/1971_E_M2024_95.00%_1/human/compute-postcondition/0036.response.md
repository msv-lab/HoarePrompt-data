Output State: **`t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variable values or states in the given initial state. It simply moves to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
