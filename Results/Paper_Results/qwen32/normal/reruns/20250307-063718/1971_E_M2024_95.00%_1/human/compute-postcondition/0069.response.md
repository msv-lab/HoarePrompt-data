The code snippet provided assigns new values to `n`, `k`, and `q` based on the input. The input is split into three integers and mapped to `n`, `k`, and `q` respectively. This means that the previous values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are overwritten by the new input values.

The other variables (`t`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `a`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is the third input integer, `l` is the previous value of `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer**.
