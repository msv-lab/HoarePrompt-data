To determine the output of the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the relationships and values of the variables involved based on the given initial state.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists starting with `0` followed by integers from the input.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `0`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `0`.
   - `v` is a list where each element (except the first) is the division of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.
   - `i` is set to `1`.
   - `q` is greater than `0`.
   - `l` and `m` are both `0`.
   - `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order, and it is given that `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The critical piece of information is that `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. This means that `ql` is already an element of `a` and `s` is the index of `ql` in `a`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.
   - Since `s` is the index where `ql` is located in `a`, the value at `b[s]` corresponds to the element in `b` that is aligned with `ql` in `a`.

Given the initial state and the information provided, the output will be the element in `b` at the same index `s` where `ql` is located in `a`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element in list b at the same index s where ql is located in list a)**

However, since we do not have the specific values of `b` and `s`, we can only describe it in terms of the relationship between `a` and `b` at the index `s`.

Final Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element in list b at the same index s where ql is located in list a)**
