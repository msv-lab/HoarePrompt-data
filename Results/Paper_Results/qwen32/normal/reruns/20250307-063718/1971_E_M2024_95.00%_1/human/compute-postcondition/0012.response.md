The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, the difference `a[3] - a[2]` is calculated and added to `ad`.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is at least 1.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one integer obtained from the input.
- `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers obtained from the input.
- `ad` is a list containing `0`, `a[1] - a[0]`, and `a[2] - a[1]`.
- `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`.
- `i` is 3.

After executing the code, `ad` will have an additional element, which is `a[3] - a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is at least 1; `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one integer obtained from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers obtained from the input; `ad` is a list containing `0`, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`; `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is 3.**
