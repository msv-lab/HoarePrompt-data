Output State: **`v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is 3`**

In simple terms, the variable `m` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.
