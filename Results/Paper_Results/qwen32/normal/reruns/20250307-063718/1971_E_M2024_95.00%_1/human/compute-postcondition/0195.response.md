Postcondition: **`v` is a list containing `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `i` is 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is 2; `m` is 0; `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration minus `2 * a[s - 1]` plus the new integer input; `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input; `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`; `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`. If `a[s] == ql`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

Since the else part is not provided and the if part does not alter the state of the variables, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.
