Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `k` <= `n` <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, and `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^5. `a` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 <= `i` <= `k-1`, and `a_k` = `n`. `b` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 <= `i` <= `k-1`. For each query, `d` is an integer such that 0 <= `d` <= `n`. The sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is any value, `b` is a list, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 2]]`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the value computed in the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ql` is the value input in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is a list containing `[a[1] / bd[1], a[2] / bd[2], ..., a[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `q`, `l` is `q`, `m` is the final calculated value of `m` from the last iteration, `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order after the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is a list containing `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `i` is 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is `q - 1`; `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`; `ql` is the final input value from the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in list `a` to maintain sorted order; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the new input; `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`; `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
