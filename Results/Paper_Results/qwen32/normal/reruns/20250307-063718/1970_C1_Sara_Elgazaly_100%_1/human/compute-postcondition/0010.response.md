The code snippet provided appends the value of `a` to the list associated with the key `b` in the `rev` defaultdict. This means that after the execution of the code, the list `rev[b]` will include the value `a` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the `rev` defaultdict is updated to include `a` in the list for the key `b`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a`, and now `rev[b]` also includes `a`.**
