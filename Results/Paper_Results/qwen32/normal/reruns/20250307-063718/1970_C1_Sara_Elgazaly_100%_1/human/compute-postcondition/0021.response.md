The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes and returns an element from the list `lst[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is initially equal to `z`, this operation will remove and assign to `tmp` one of the nodes that `z` is connected to in the tree.

Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves and `z` is a node with at least one edge, `lst[z]` must contain at least one element. Let's denote the node that gets popped from `lst[z]` as `u`. After this operation, `lst[z]` will no longer contain `u`, and `tmp` will be updated to `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except `lst[z]` no longer includes `tmp`. `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input. `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is the node that was connected to `z` and has now been removed from `lst[z]`, `one` is False.**
