The given code snippet appends the integer `b` to the list in the `defaultdict` `lst` at the key `a`. This means that the list associated with the key `a` in `lst` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
