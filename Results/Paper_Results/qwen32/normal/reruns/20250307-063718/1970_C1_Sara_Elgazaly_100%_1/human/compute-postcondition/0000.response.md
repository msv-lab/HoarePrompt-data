The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state describes the variables `n` and `t`, the structure of the tree, and the starting node for each round. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
