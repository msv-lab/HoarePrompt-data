The code snippet provided is `tmp = z`. This line assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`.

Given the initial state, `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`. The variable `tmp` was previously a leaf node of the tree. After executing the code, `tmp` now holds the value of `z`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `x`, `y`, `lst`, `rev`, `one`, `two`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is True.**
