The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list stored at key `a` in the `defaultdict` `lst`. This means that if `a` already has a list associated with it, `b` will be added to the end of that list. If `a` does not have a list associated with it, a new list will be created with `b` as its first element.

The variables `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting node for each round remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are also not affected by this code snippet. The `rev` defaultdict is also unaffected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a`. `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
