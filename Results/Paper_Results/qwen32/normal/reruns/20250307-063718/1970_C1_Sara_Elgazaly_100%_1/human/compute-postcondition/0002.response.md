The provided code snippet initializes a new defaultdict named `rev`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, `x`, `y`, `lst`, or the starting node integers `u_1, ..., u_t`. The only change is the introduction of the `rev` defaultdict.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists. `rev` is a defaultdict of lists.**
