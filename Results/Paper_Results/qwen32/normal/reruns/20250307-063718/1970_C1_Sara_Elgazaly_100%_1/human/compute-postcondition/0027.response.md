The code snippet provided is `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()`. This line of code removes the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to the variable `tmp`.

Here is the impact on the variables:
- `tmp` is reassigned to the last element that was in `lst[tmp]`.
- `lst[tmp]` now has one less element, specifically, the element that was assigned to `tmp` has been removed.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, `rev`, `z`, `one`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except `lst[z]` no longer includes `tmp` (which is now the node that was the last element in `lst[tmp]` before it was popped), but `lst[tmp]` now includes at least one element except the last one which has been popped and assigned to `tmp`. `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input. `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is the node that was the last element in `lst[tmp]` before it was popped, `one` is False.**
