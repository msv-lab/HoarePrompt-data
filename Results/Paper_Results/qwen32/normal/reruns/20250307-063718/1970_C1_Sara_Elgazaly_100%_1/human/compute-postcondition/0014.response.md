The code snippet provided appends the value of `a` to the list stored in `rev[b]`. This means that the defaultdict `rev` will now have `a` added to the list of values associated with the key `b`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that gets updated is `rev`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `x`, `y`, `lst`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` and any other values previously associated with `b`. `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
