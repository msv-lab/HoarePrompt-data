Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is True.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except the edge leading from `rev[z][-1]` to `z` has been removed, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is equal to the last element of `rev[z]` before it was removed, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except the edge leading from `rev[z][-1]` to `z` has been removed, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is equal to the last element of `rev[tmp]` before it was removed, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is True, and `rev[tmp]` includes all elements except the last one that was popped, which is now assigned to `tmp`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except the edge leading from `rev[z][-1]` to `z` has been removed, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before it was removed, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is False, and `rev[tmp]` includes one less element than before.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
