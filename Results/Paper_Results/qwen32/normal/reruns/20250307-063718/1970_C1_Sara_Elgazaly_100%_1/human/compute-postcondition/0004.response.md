The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, or `rev`. The only change is the introduction of the new variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
