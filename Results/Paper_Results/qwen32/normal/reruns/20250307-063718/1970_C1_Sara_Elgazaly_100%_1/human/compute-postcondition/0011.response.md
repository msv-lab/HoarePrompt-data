The loop head in the given for loop is `_` and `x - 1`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable that can be adjusted to determine whether the loop executes again is the loop counter, which is implicitly controlled by `x`.

The loop will execute `x - 1` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an integer such that `x ≥ 2`. This means that the loop has already executed once (since `x - 1` is at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `x - 1` must still be greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 1.

Since the loop has already executed once, `x` must be decremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `x - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a`, and now `rev[b]` also includes `a`. `x` is decremented by 1.**
