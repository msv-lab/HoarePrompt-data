The code snippet `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. This means that the list `rev[tmp]` will have one less element after the operation, and `tmp` will now hold the value of the element that was popped.

Given the initial state, `rev[tmp]` includes at least one element, so `rev[tmp].pop()` will successfully remove and return the last element of `rev[tmp]`. Let's denote this popped value by `u`. After the operation, `tmp` will be equal to `u`, and `rev[tmp]` will no longer include `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except all edges leading to the leaf node `tmp` have been removed, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input except the edge leading from `rev[z][-1]` to `z` has been removed, `z` is an integer such that `z` is a node in the tree and there is at least one edge connected to `z`, `tmp` is equal to the last element of `rev[tmp]` before it was removed, `one` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations, `two` is True, and `rev[tmp]` includes all elements except the last one that was popped, which is now assigned to `tmp`.**

In simpler terms, `tmp` is now the last element that was in `rev[tmp]`, and `rev[tmp]` has one less element than before. All other variables remain unchanged.
