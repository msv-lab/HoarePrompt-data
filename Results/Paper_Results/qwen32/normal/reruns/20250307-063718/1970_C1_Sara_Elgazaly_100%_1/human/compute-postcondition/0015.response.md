Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` now including `b` for all edges (a, b) read from the input, and `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where `rev[b]` includes `a` for all edges (a, b) read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all the iterations, the `lst` dictionary will contain all the edges of the tree in the form of adjacency lists, indicating which nodes are directly connected to each node. Similarly, the `rev` dictionary will also contain these edges in reverse, indicating which nodes connect to each node. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting node(s) remain unchanged from the initial state.
