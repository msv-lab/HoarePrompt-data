Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m) and m (m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The next m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and no loops. The graph may not be connected, but it is guaranteed that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
