The code snippet initializes a variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. The value of `res` is now 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than 2^31; `res` is 0.**
