Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than 2^31, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with `((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num)` mapped to `1`, and `num` is not a key in the `count` dictionary except for the newly added key `((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num)` which has a value of `1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
