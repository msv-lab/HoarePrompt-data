### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The core logic of the program relies on the function `func_1`, which is supposed to determine the highest bit position set in the binary representation of `k`. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it always returns `-1`, regardless of the input value of `n`. This incorrect return value would lead to incorrect behavior in the main program logic.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to find the position of the highest bit set in the binary representation of `n`. The correct implementation should return the highest bit position (0-indexed) set in `n`. For example, for `n = 5` (binary `101`), the function should return `2`. However, the current implementation always returns `-1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
    - If `n > 1`, the program calculates `counter = func_1(k)`, which is always `-1` due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.
    - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. Since `counter` is `-1`, this results in `2 ** (-1) - 1`, which is not a valid integer and would raise an error. However, in Python, `2 ** -1` evaluates to `0.5`, and subtracting `1` gives `-0.5`. Since the program is using integer arithmetic, it would actually append `-2` to the array, which is incorrect and does not satisfy the problem constraints.
    - The program then appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array. Given the incorrect value of `arr[-1]`, this step also results in an incorrect value.
    - The program fills the remaining positions in the array with `0`s.
    - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `k`.

Given the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the program does not correctly compute the sequence of integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
