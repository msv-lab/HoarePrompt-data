Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, there is a critical issue in the function `func_1`, which is supposed to determine the highest bit position of the binary representation of `k`. The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and always returns -1, regardless of the input value of `n`. This incorrect implementation leads to incorrect results in the program.

Given the incorrect behavior of `func_1`, the sequence constructed by the program might not satisfy the condition of maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
