The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `position` to 0. No other variables are affected, and no calculations or changes are made to the input values `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.**
