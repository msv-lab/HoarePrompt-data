To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop repeatedly divides `n` by 2 (using the right shift operator `>>`) and increments `position` by 1 until `n` becomes 0.

The loop will stop when `n` is reduced to 0, meaning `position` will be equal to the number of times you can divide `n` by 2 before it becomes 0. This is equivalent to the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be:

- `n` will be 0.
- `position` will be the number of times `n` was divided by 2 before it became 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0 and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` will be 0, and `position` will indicate how many times we divided the original `n` by 2 to reach 0.
