The function `highest_set_bit` takes a single integer `n` where `n` is a non-negative integer. However, based on the problem description, the actual input variables are `t`, `n`, and `k` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k` is the sum of these integers (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). It is also guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
