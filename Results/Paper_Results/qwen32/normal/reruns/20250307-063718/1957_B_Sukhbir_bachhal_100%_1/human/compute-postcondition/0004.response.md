For the given task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `while n != 0:`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
- `position` is 0.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 2 · 10^5 (inclusive) for each test case, `n` will never be 0 right before the loop starts. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time without any modification to the state.

Thus, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.**
