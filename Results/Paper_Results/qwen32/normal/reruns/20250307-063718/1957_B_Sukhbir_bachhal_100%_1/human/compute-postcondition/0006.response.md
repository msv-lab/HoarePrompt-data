Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0; `position` is 1. `n` is now `n >> 1`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer.**

In simpler terms, the `position` variable has been incremented by 1, so `position` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
