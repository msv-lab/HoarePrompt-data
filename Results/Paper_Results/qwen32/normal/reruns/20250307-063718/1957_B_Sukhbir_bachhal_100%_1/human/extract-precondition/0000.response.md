Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
