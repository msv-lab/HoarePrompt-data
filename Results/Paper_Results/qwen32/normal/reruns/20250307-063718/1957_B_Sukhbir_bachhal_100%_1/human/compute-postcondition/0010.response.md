The `while` loop in the given code will continue to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
- `n` is now `n // 2`.
- `position` is 2.

The loop condition is `while n != 0`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must not be 0.

Since `n` is reassigned to `n // 2` at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must not be 0. This implies that `n` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration (because if `n` were 1, `n // 2` would be 0, and the loop would terminate).

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to a value greater than 1.

State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0; `position` is 2. `n` must be greater than 1.**
