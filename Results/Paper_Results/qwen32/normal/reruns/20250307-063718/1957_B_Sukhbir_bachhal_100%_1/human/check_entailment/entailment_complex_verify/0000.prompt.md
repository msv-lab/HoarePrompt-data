You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Given integers \( n \) and \( k \), the task is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k \)
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of \( a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n \) (bitwise OR operation) is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

### Explanation of the Program
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function returns the highest position (0-indexed) of the highest set bit in \( n \).
   - For example, if \( n = 5 \) (binary `101`), `func_1(5)` returns 2.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If \( n = 1 \), the sequence is just \( k \).
   - If \( n > 1 \):
     - It calculates the highest set bit position of \( k \) using `func_1(k)`.
     - It constructs the sequence by setting the first element to \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) (a number with all bits set up to the highest set bit of \( k \)).
     - The second element is set to \( k - \text{first element} \).
     - The remaining \( n-2 \) elements are set to 0.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
1
1 5
```
Output:
```
5
```
This is correct.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
Output:
```
3 0
```
This is correct. \( 3 | 0 = 3 \) (binary `11`), which has 2 ones.

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
1
2 5
```
Output:
```
7 0
```
This is incorrect. \( 7 | 0 = 7 \) (binary `111`), which has 3 ones, but the sequence should be \( 5 0 \) (or \( 3 2 \) or other valid combinations).

#### Example 4:
Input:
```
1
6 51
```
Output:
```
63 0 0 0 0 0
```
This is incorrect. \( 63 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 = 63 \) (binary `111111`), which has 6 ones, but the sequence should be \( 3 1 1 32 2 12 \) or similar valid combinations.

### Conclusion
The program does not always produce the correct sequence of numbers that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence when \( n > 1 \) does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to provide the optimal sequence for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation for some cases, such as when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 5 \), or when \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 51 \).
