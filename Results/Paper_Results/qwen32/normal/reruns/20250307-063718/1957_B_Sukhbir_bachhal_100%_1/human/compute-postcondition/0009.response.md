Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0; `position` is 2. `n` is now `n // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `position` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state. The value of `n` is still `n // 2` as it was in the initial state.
