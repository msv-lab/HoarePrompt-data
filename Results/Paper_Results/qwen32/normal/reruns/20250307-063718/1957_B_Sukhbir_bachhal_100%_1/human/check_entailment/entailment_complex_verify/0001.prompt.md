You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is their sum. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The sum of the sequence \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = k \).
2. **Bitwise OR Constraint**: Maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence \( a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n \).

### Program Analysis:

#### Input Handling:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

#### Logic for Constructing the Sequence:
- **Single Element Case (\( n = 1 \))**: The sequence contains only one element, which is \( k \). This trivially satisfies both conditions.
- **Multiple Elements Case (\( n > 1 \))**:
  - The program calls a function `func_1(k)` to determine the position of the highest set bit in \( k \). This function essentially calculates \( \lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor \).
  - It then constructs the sequence by:
    - Adding \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) as the first element. This number has all bits set up to the position of the highest set bit in \( k \).
    - Adding \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) as the second element.
    - Adding zeros for the remaining elements until the sequence length is \( n \).

#### Bitwise OR Maximization:
- The first element in the sequence, \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \), has the maximum possible number of 1s in its binary representation for the given \( k \). This is because it sets all bits from 0 to \( \lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor \).
- The second element, \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \), ensures that the sum constraint is satisfied.
- The remaining elements are all zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sum Constraint**: The sum of the sequence is \( (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) + 0 + \ldots + 0 = k \), which satisfies the sum constraint.
- **Bitwise OR Constraint**: The bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized by the first element \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \), which has the maximum number of 1s possible for the given \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence to satisfy both the sum and bitwise OR constraints.

Correctness: **True**
