Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the program is correct according to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case (`n = 1`)**:
   - The program correctly outputs `k` as the only element in the sequence, which trivially satisfies both constraints.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest set bit in `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding `2^counter - 1` as the first element.
     - Adding `k - (2^counter - 1)` as the second element.
     - Adding zeros for the remaining elements until the sequence length is `n`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` always returns -1, regardless of the value of `n`. However, based on the provided code, `func_1` actually calculates the position of the highest set bit in `k` (i.e., `floor(log2(k))`).

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sum Constraint**:
  - The sum of the sequence is `(2^counter - 1) + (k - (2^counter - 1)) + 0 + ... + 0 = k`, which satisfies the sum constraint.
  
- **Bitwise OR Constraint**:
  - The first element `2^counter - 1` has all bits set up to the position of the highest set bit in `k`.
  - The second element `k - (2^counter - 1)` ensures that the sum constraint is satisfied.
  - The remaining elements are all zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` calculates the correct position of the highest set bit in `k`. This is verified by the code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```
This function correctly computes `floor(log2(k))`.

### Conclusion:
Given the correct behavior of `func_1` and the logic used to construct the sequence, the program correctly satisfies both the sum and bitwise OR constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
