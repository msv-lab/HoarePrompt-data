The code snippet `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `n`, effectively dividing `n` by 2 and discarding the remainder. 

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer greater than 1. After the operation, `n` will be halved and rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9), where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` is their sum. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 2. `n` must be greater than 1; `n` is now `n // 2`.**
