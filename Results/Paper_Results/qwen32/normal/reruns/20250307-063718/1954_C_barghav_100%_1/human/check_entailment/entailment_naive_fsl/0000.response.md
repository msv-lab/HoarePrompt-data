Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by performing the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed in the way it handles the swapping of digits.

The program only performs a swap if the digits in `a` are less than the digits in `b` and only does this once (`f = 1` ensures that no further swaps are made after the first swap where `a[i] < b[i]`). It also incorrectly swaps digits if `a[i] > b[i]` after the first swap, which does not necessarily maximize the product.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
35
53
```

**Expected Output:**
```
55
33
```
This is because swapping the digits of both numbers results in the maximum product (55 * 33 = 1815).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
35
53
```
This is because the program does not perform any swaps in this case, even though it could have swapped the digits to increase the product.

To correctly maximize the product, the program should consider all possible swaps and evaluate the resulting products to find the maximum. The current implementation does not ensure this and thus is incorrect.
