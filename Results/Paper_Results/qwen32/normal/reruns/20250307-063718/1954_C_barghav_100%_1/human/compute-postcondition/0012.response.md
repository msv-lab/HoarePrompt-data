Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` and must have at least one character; `b` is a list of characters representing the input; `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is the original character at index `i` in `b`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `f` is 1; otherwise, `f` remains 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0.**
