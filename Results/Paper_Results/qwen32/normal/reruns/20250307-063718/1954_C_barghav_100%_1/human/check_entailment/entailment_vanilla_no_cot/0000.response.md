Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by swapping corresponding digits. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed as it only performs a single swap if the digits are different and does not continue to try to maximize the product.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:
- The flag `f` is set to 1 after the first swap, and no further swaps are considered after that, even if they could lead to a higher product.
- The logic does not ensure that the maximum possible product is achieved by considering all possible swaps.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that for each corresponding pair of digits, we swap them if it leads to a higher product. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a = list(input().strip())
    b = list(input().strip())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
    print(''.join(a))
    print(''.join(b))
```

This corrected version simply swaps the digits if the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `a`, ensuring that we maximize the product by always making the larger digit contribute to the more significant place in the resulting numbers.
