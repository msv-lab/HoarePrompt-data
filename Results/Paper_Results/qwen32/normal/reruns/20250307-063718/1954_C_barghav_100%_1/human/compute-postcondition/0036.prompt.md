Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y`; `b` is a list of characters representing the input; `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` and must have at least one character; `b` is a list of characters representing the input; `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1 and `a[i]` remains the original character at index `i` in `b`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1 and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are swapped. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` and must have at least one character; `b` is a list of characters representing the input. If `f` is 0, `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged. If `f` is 1, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped (if `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`), or `a[i]` has been set to `b[i]` (if `a[i]` was less than `b[i]`). `i` remains 1, and `f` is 1 if a swap or change occurred, otherwise `f` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y`; `b` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y`. If `f` was initially 0, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped if `a[2]` was not equal to `b[2]`, and `f` is set to 1 if a swap occurred. If `f` was initially 1, `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged if `a[2]` was not greater than `b[2]`. `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
