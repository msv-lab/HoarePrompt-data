To determine the output of the print statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- The list `a` is mentioned to be printed out, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
- The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- `b` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is now 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```
- `b[i]` accesses the element at index `i` in the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 0, `b[i]` is equivalent to `b[0]`, which is the first element of the list `b`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after the printed element.

### Output Determination:
- Given that `b` is a list with at least one element, `b[0]` will be the first element of `b`.
- Since the exact contents of `b` are not specified, we can only state that the output will be the first element of `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[0] (where b[0] is the first element of the list b)**
