Given the initial state:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Variable `a`**: The variable `a` is a list that contains at least two elements. However, the exact values of the elements in the list are not provided. We know only that `a` has at least two elements.

2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.

3. **Indexing in `a`**: Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a` (since list indexing in Python starts at 0).

4. **Print Statement**: The `print` function will output the element at index `i` of the list `a`, which is `a[1]`. The `end=''` argument specifies that no newline character should be added at the end of the print statement.

Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical or string value that will be printed. However, we know that it will be the second element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
