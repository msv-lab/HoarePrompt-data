You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and prints them after potentially swapping some of their corresponding digits based on a specific rule. It prints the modified version of `x` first, followed by the original `y`, each on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by performing the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed in the way it handles the swapping of digits.

The program only performs a swap if the digits in `a` are less than the digits in `b` and only does this once (`f = 1` ensures that no further swaps are made after the first swap where `a[i] < b[i]`). It also incorrectly swaps digits if `a[i] > b[i]` after the first swap, which does not necessarily maximize the product.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
35
53
```

**Expected Output:**
```
55
33
```
This is because swapping the digits of both numbers results in the maximum product (55 * 33 = 1815).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
35
53
```
This is because the program does not perform any swaps in this case, even though it could have swapped the digits to increase the product.

To correctly maximize the product, the program should consider all possible swaps and evaluate the resulting products to find the maximum. The current implementation does not ensure this and thus is incorrect.
