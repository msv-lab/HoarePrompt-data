The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
