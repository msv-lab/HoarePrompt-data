Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` and must have at least one character, where `a[i]` is now the value of `b[i]` before the swap; `b` is a list of characters representing the input, where `b[i]` is now the value of `a[i]` before the swap; `i` is 1; `f` is 1.**
