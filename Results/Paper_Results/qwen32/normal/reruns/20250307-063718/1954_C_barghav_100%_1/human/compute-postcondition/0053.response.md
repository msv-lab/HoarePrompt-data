Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. For each of the `t` test cases, it processes two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, where `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a specific value or performs an operation based on the comparison or processing of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
