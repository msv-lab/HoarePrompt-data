Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` and must have at least one character; `b` is a list of characters representing the input. If `f` was 0, `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged. If `f` was 1 or if `a[2] > b[2]`, `a[2]` and `b[2]` have been swapped. `i` is 2, and `f` is 1 if a swap or change occurred, otherwise `f` remains 0.**
