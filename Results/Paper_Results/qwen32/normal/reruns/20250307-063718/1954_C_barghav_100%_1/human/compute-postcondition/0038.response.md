To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `a` must have at least one element.
2. **Print Statement**: `print(a[i], end='')`

From the initial state, we know that `a` is a list with at least one element. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact element of the list `a` that will be printed. 

However, we can describe the output in terms of `i` and `a`.

- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- Since `a` has at least one element, `i` must be a valid index for the list `a` (i.e., `i` should be between 0 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive).

Given that the `end=''` argument in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added at the end of the printed output, the output will be the element at index `i` of the list `a` without a newline.

Therefore, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **a[i] (where a is the list and i is a valid index for a)**
