Given the initial state:
- The complete list `a` is printed out, but it is not relevant to the current `print` statement.
- `t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- `b` must be a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `b`.

Given that `b` is a list with at least one element, but the exact elements of `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of `b`.

Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the element at index 1 of the list b)**
