To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `a[i]` accesses the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` will access the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline character is added at the end of the printed output.

### Output:
The code will print the element at index 2 of the list `a` without adding a newline character at the end. 

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we know that it will be the element at index 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
