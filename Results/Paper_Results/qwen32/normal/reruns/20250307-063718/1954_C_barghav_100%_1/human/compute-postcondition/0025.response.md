Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and 1 <= x < 10^100, 1 <= y < 10^100; `a` is a list of characters representing the input integer `x` or `y` with the character at index `i` swapped with the character at index `i` in `b` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters representing the input with the character at index `i` swapped with the character at index `i` in `a` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`; `i` is 1; `f` remains unchanged.**
