Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`, while `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that their sum equals `n`. The function aims to distribute the numbers in the list into three groups, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, containing `na`, `nb`, and `nc` numbers respectively. If it is possible to distribute the numbers in such a way that the sums of the numbers in each group are as balanced as possible and the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True for the sums of these groups, the function returns a tuple ('YES', `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`). If such a distribution is not possible, the function returns 'NO'.**
