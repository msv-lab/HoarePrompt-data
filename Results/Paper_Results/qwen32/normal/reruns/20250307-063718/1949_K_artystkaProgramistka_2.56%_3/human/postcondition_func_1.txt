The function takes a positive integer `n` and three other positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, along with a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers. It attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, aiming to balance the sums of the numbers in each group. If the distribution results in sums that satisfy a condition checked by `func_1`, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
