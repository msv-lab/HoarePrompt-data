Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = 0`, and `numbers` is an empty list; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing all the numbers from the original `numbers` list distributed to keep the sums as balanced as possible; `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`; the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns False**
