To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the initial state. The code snippet calls a function `func_1(a, b)` and assigns its return value to the variable `winner`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` is an empty list.

The function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact value that `winner` will hold. However, we can state that `winner` will hold the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.**
