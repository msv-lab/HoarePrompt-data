The code snippet reads an integer input representing the number of test cases and assigns it to the variable `t`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The output state includes the newly assigned value of `t` and the unchanged values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.**
