The code provided reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `a` and `b` are integers read from input, and `t` is decremented by 1, but the code does not affect `t`. Similarly, `results` and `winner` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**.
