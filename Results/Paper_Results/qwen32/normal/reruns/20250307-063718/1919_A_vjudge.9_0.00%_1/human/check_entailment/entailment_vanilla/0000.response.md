Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, each with a certain number of coins in their wallets. The players take turns, and in each turn:
1. A player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
2. A player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The player who cannot make a move (because their wallet has 0 coins) loses. Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The key insight for solving this problem lies in the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins. If it is odd, Alice wins.

#### Reasoning:
- **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):**
  - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps. If Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that Bob always has a move until Alice is left with 0 coins, making Bob the winner.
  
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):**
  - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. Alice can ensure that after her turn, the remaining total number of coins is even, which aligns with the winning strategy for Bob described above. Therefore, Alice can force Bob to be the one left with 0 coins, making Alice the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function determines the winner based on the total number of coins (a + b).
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the key insight described above:
- If (a + b) is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If (a + b) is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the winner of the game based on the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
