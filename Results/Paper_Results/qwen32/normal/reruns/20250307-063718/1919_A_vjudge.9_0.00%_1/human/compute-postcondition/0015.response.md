The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the elements in the list `results`. For the loop to execute, the list `results` must have at least one element. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9.
- `t` is 0, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each respective iteration.
- `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.

Since `t` is 0, the list `results` currently has 0 elements, which means the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, `results` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` is 1, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration; `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` for the iteration; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.**
