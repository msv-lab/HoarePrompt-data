Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, with constraints 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9. It returns "Alice" if `a` is greater than `b`, "Bob" if `b` is greater than `a`, and "Tie" if `a` is equal to `b`.**
