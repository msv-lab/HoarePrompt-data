The code snippet initializes an empty list called `results`. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state remains with `a` and `b` still representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, and `t` still being the number of test cases.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is the number of test cases entered by the user; `results` is an empty list.**
