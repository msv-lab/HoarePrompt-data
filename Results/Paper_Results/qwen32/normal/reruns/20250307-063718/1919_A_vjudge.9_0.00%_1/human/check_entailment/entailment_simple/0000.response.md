### Reasoning:
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the game mechanics and the optimal strategy for both players. The game essentially revolves around the total number of coins (a + b) and how they can be manipulated by swapping wallets and removing coins.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Total Coins Parity**: The critical observation is that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players will play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning. The optimal strategy involves forcing the opponent into a losing position.
3. **Losing Position**: A losing position is when a player is forced to make a move when both wallets are empty or when they have no valid move left.
4. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that Alice is always left with the last move and thus losing the game.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position by playing optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) to determine the winner:
- If (a + b) is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If (a + b) is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

This logic aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy derived from the game analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Given the problem description and the provided input-output pairs, the program behaves as expected.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
