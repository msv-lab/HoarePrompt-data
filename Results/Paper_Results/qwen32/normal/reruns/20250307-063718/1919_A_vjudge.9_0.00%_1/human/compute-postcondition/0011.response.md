The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `winner`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 1 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**.

Natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while `t`, `results`, and `winner` retain their previous values.
