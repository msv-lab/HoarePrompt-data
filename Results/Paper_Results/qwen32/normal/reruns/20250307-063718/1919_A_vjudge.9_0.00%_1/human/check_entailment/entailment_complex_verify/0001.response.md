### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly analyzes the game mechanics and the optimal strategies for both players based on the total number of coins. Here's a detailed breakdown to confirm the reasoning:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., whose wallet has 0 coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):**
     - Bob can mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps. If Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap.
     - This ensures that Bob always has a move until Alice is left with 0 coins.
     - Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):**
     - Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
     - Alice can ensure that after her turn, the remaining total number of coins is even, aligning with Bob's winning strategy.
     - Therefore, Alice wins.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins.
     - If (a + b) is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If (a + b) is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - They confirm that the function `func_1` returns 'Bob' if the total number of coins is even and 'Alice' if the total number of coins is odd.
   - The annotations also correctly state that `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the winner of the game based on the total number of coins. The annotations and the original assessment both confirm the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
