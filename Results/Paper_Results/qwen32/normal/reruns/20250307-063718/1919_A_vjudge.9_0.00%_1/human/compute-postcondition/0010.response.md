The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was decremented by 1, so `t` must have been greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 1 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**
