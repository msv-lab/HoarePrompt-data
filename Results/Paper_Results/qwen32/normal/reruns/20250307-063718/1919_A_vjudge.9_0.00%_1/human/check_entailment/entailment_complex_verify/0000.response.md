### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight of the problem, which is that the winner of the game can be determined by the parity of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins. This insight is based on the optimal play strategy for both players.

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returning "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the input, calling `func_1` for each pair of (a, b), and storing the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The annotations provided in the annotated code correctly describe the program's state and behavior at key points. They confirm that the function `func_1` returns the correct winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, and that `func_2` processes each test case correctly.

The example input and expected output provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, as confirmed by the original assessment. The program produces the expected output for all the given test cases.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases as required.

### Final:

Final: **True**
