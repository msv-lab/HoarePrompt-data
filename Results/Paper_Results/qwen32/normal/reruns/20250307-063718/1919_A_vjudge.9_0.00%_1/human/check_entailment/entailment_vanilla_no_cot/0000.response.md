To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution provided.

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins until one of them cannot make a move. The key aspect of the problem is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

The solution provided in `func_1` is based on the sum of coins in both wallets. It states that if the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins, and if it's odd, Alice wins. This logic is derived from the observation that the game can be reduced to a Nim game with a single pile of `(a + b)` coins, where each player can either remove 1 coin or exchange wallets (which doesn't change the total number of coins but changes whose pile the coins are in).

The analysis is correct because:
- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position by playing optimally.
- If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always force the first player (Alice) into a losing position by playing optimally.

Given this understanding, the program logic in `func_1` is correct, and `func_2` correctly reads the input, applies the logic, and outputs the results.

Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **True**
