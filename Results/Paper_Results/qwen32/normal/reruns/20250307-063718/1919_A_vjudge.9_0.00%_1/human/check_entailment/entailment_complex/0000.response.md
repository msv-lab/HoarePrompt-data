### Reasoning:

The problem states that the winner of the game is determined by whether the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially boils down to whether the total number of moves (which is equal to the total number of coins) is even or odd. If the total number of moves is even, Bob will make the last move and win. If it's odd, Alice will make the last move and win.

**Function 1 (func_1):**
- This function takes two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
- It calculates the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If the total number of coins is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the total number of coins is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
- This logic correctly implements the winning condition as described in the problem statement.

**Function 2 (func_2):**
- This function reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
- It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.
- It stores the result in a list.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The logic in both functions correctly implements the problem's requirements. The program reads the input, determines the winner based on the total number of coins, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
