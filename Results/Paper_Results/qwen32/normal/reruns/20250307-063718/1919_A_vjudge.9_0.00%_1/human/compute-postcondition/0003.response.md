The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This means that the initial values of `a` and `b` provided in the initial state are overwritten by the values read from the input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while `t` remains greater than 0 and `results` remains an empty list.
