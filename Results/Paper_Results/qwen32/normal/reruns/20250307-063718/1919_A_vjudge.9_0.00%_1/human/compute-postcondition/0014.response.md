Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` is 0, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each respective iteration; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are completed, `t` will be 0 because it was decremented by 1 for each iteration. The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each of the initial `t` test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, and `winner` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.
