Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is the number of test cases entered by the user; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    winner = func_1(a, b)
    results.append(winner)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 1 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
