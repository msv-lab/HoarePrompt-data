The only variable in the loop head is `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has more than one element, the loop can execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains 1 element, which means the loop has just finished executing for that element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements. The variable `result` will take the value of the second element in the `results` list.

Given that `t` is a counter that is decremented by 1 for each iteration, and it was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it would be 0 after this iteration, indicating no more iterations if `results` only had one element. To have another iteration, `results` must have another element, and `t` would need to be adjusted accordingly if it is related to the number of iterations left.

However, since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we focus on `result` and `results`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` is 1, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration; `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration and the second element is the next value to be processed; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration; `result` is the second element in the `results` list.**
