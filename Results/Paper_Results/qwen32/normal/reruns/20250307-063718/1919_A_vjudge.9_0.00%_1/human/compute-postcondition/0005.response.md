Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.**

Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include the value of `winner`, which is the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
