The code snippet reassigns the variable `winner` to the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. Since `results` is already initialized with the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, the value of `winner` will be the same as the first element in `results`. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**
