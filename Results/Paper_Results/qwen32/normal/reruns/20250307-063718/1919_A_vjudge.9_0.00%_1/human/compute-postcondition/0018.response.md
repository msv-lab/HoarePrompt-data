Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers with values such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
- `t` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 for each iteration, but its current value is not specified.
- `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements:
  - The first element is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.
  - The second element is the next value to be processed.
- `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.
- `result` is the second element in the `results` list.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is explicitly defined as the second element in the `results` list.
- The value of `result` is not dependent on any other variables or calculations within the provided code snippet.
- The exact value of `result` is not specified in the initial state, but we know it is the second element of the `results` list.

### Output:
Since `result` is the second element of the `results` list, and no further manipulation or calculation is performed on `result` before the `print` statement, the output will be the value of the second element in the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the second element of the `results` list)**
