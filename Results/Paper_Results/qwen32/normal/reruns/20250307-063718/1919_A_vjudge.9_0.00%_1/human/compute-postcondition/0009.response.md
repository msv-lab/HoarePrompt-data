The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Since `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, and `results` initially contains one element which is also the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, after the execution, `results` will have two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**
