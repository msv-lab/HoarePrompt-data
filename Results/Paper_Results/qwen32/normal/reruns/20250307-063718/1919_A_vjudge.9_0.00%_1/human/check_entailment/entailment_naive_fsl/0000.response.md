Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with their wallets.
- Alice starts first.
- Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep the current one.
- The player then removes 1 coin from the current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Determine the winner if both play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd/even) of the total number of coins (a + b).
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

### Provided Program:
```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b).
- The logic in `func_1` aligns with the key insight derived from the problem description.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each case with `func_1`, and printing the results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

#### Example Input:
```
10
1 1
1 4
5 3
4 5
11 9
83 91
1032 9307
839204 7281
1000000000 1000000000
53110 2024
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Bob
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob
Bob
Alice
Alice
Bob
Bob
```

#### Program Output:
The program should produce the above output, which matches the expected results based on the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly determines the winner for every potential case based on the problem description and handles the provided examples accurately.
