Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the winner of the game based on the total number of coins Alice and Bob have together. The key insight is that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity (odd or even) game where the player who faces an even number of coins at the start of their turn will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles the input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and then uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case. It collects all the results and prints them.

The description of `func_2` in the output hints contains a minor inaccuracy: it states that it prints "Alice" if Alice has more coins, "Bob" if Bob has more coins, or "Tie" if they have the same number of coins. However, this is not the case. The function actually determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, not on the individual numbers of coins each player has.

Despite this minor inaccuracy in the description, the code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
