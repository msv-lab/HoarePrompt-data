Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 1 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**

In this output state, the `results` list has been updated to include the `winner` value, making it contain three elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial state.
