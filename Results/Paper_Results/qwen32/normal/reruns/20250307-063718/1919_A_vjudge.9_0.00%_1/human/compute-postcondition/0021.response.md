To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given information about the loop and its behavior during the first three iterations. 

From the description:
- The loop iterates over the `results` list.
- The `results` list contains values returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.
- The `winner` variable holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.
- The loop prints each `result` in the `results` list.

The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in the `results` list. Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, and this value is decremented by 1 for each iteration. However, the value of `t` itself doesn't change the number of iterations; it just keeps track of how many iterations have been completed.

Given that `t` is initially 0 and decremented by 1 for each iteration, the loop will not execute at all if `t` is 0. But since the problem states that the loop has executed at least three times, we can infer that `t` was initially set to a value greater than or equal to 3, and it has been decremented by 1 for each of the three iterations we've seen.

After all iterations are complete, `t` will be decremented to 0, and the `results` list will have been fully iterated over. The `winner` variable will still hold the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `t` is 0, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each respective iteration; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)` from the last iteration.**

In natural language: After all iterations are complete, `t` is 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The `results` list contains all the values returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, and the `winner` variable holds the value from the last iteration. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they were initially read from the input.
