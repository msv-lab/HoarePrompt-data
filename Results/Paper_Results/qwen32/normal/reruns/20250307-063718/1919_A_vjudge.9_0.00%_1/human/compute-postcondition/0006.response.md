The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration, it doesn't need to be adjusted manually. The loop will automatically handle the increment of `_`. However, `t` determines whether the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. After one iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. `t` is decremented by 1**.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment:
State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from input, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**.
