The code snippet `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers from the input, splits them, converts each to an integer, and assigns them to the `i`th positions of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. Given that initially `i` is 1, the first elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` are already assigned. After executing this line, the `i`th elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` (where `i` is 1) will be updated with the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where the first element is the first integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `y` is a list where the first element is the second integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `r` is a list where the first element is the third integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is 1**.

In simpler terms, the first elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are now the three integers provided by the user input, and all other variables remain unchanged.
