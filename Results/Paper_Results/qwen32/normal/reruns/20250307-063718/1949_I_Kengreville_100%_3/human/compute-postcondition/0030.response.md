Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is `1` if `not visited[i]` is true, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0` if `not visited[i]` is true, `bipartite` is `True` if `not visited[i]` is true, and `ok` is `ok or (True and tot != 0)` if `not visited[i]` is true. If `visited[i]` is true, the values of `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.**
