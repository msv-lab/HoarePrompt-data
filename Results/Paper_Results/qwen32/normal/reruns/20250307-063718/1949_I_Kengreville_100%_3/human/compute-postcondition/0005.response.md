The provided code snippet reassigns the `coef` variable to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This means that the previous contents of `coef` (which were `None` values) are replaced by a new list of `None` values of the same length. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
