Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which might be updated, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be updated, and `ok` is `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is `1` if `not visited[i]` is true, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0` if `not visited[i]` is true, `bipartite` is `True` if `not visited[i]` is true, and `ok` is `ok or (True and tot != 0)` if `not visited[i]` is true. If `visited[i]` is true, the values of `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[0]` and `visited[n-1]` are `True`, `coef[0]` and `coef[n-1]` are `1`, `i` is `0`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
