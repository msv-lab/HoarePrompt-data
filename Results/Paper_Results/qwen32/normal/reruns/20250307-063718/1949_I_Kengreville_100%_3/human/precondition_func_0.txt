n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk for 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
