Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is `1`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `ok or (True and tot != 0)`**

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Given that `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, the expression `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the value of `ok` remains unchanged as `ok or False` is equivalent to `ok`. All other variables remain unchanged.
