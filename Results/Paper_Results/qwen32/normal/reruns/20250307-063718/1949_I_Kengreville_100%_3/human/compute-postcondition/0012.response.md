Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `x` will contain the first integers from each of the `n` inputs, the list `y` will contain the second integers, and the list `r` will contain the third integers. The `visited` list will remain as a list of `False` values, and the `coef` list will remain as a list of `None` values. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, reflecting that the last iteration of the loop has completed.
