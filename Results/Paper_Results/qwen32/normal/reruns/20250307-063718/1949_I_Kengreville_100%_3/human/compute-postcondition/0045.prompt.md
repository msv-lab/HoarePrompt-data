You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk for 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `n-1`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values for all visited nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total accumulated value from the `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite, and `ok` is `True` if there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values for all visited nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total accumulated value from the `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite, and `ok` is a boolean indicating whether there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`. Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`. If `ok` is `False`, there was no bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of disks, lists `x` and `y` representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, list `r` representing the radii of the disks, a list `visited` of boolean values initialized to False, and a list `coef` of None values used to store coefficients during a DFS traversal. The function performs some operation (implied by the DFS traversal) and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
