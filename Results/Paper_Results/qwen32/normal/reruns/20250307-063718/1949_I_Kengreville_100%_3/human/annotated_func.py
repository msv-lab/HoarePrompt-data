#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk for 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.

    #State: `n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values for all visited nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total accumulated value from the `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite, and `ok` is a boolean indicating whether there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`. Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`. If `ok` is `False`, there was no bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of disks and their respective center coordinates and radii, then determines if there exists at least one bipartite component with a non-zero accumulated value after performing a DFS traversal. It prints "YES" if such a component exists, otherwise it prints "NO".
