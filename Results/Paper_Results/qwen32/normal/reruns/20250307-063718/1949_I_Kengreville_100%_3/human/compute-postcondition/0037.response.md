Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[0]` and `visited[n-1]` are `True`, `coef[0]` and `coef[n-1]` are `1`, `i` is `0`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.**
