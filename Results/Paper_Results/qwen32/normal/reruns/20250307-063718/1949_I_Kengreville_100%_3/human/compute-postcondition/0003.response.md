The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list consisting of `None` values with length `n`. This means the previous values in `r` (which were positive integer radii of the i-th disk for `0 <= i < n`) are discarded, and `r` now contains `None` for each of its `n` elements.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**

In simpler terms, the list `r` is now filled with `None` values, while all other variables retain their initial values.
