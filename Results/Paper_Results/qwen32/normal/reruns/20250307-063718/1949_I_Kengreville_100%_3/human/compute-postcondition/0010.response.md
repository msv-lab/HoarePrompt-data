The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where the first element is the first integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `y` is a list where the first element is the second integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `r` is a list where the first element is the third integer from the new input and the rest are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is 2**
