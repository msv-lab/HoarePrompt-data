The given code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the respective indices in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` at index `i`, which is 2. Since `x`, `y`, and `r` initially have their first elements set and the rest as `None`, this operation will change the values at index 2 of these lists.

Given that the initial state specifies `n` as an integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, and `i` is 2, the operation will affect the values of `x[2]`, `y[2]`, and `r[2]` without altering any other variables or their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where the first element is the first integer from the new input, the second element is `None`, and the third element is the first integer from the latest input, `y` is a list where the first element is the second integer from the new input, the second element is `None`, and the third element is the second integer from the latest input, `r` is a list where the first element is the third integer from the new input, the second element is `None`, and the third element is the third integer from the latest input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is 2**.
