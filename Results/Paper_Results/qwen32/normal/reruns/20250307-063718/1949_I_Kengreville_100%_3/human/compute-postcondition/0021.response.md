To determine the Output State after the execution of `dfs(i)`, we need to understand what the `dfs` function does. However, since the `dfs` function is not provided, we can only make assumptions based on typical behavior of depth-first search (DFS) algorithms in graph theory, which often involve visiting nodes, updating a visited status, and possibly modifying other variables.

Given the initial state and the typical behavior of DFS, let's assume the following:
- The `dfs` function will visit the node `i` (which is `n-1`).
- It will update the `visited` list to mark node `i` as `True`.
- It will possibly update the `coef` list based on some conditions (though the exact conditions are not provided).
- It will update `tot` based on some calculations (though the exact calculations are not provided).
- It will update `bipartite` and `ok` based on some conditions (though the exact conditions are not provided).

Assuming the `dfs` function does not return any value but modifies the provided lists and variables, we can infer the following changes:
- `visited[i]` will be `True`.
- Other elements of `visited` will remain `False`.
- `coef[i]` might be updated, but since the exact update is not specified, we assume it could be modified in some way.
- `tot` might be updated, but since the exact update is not specified, we assume it could be modified in some way.
- `bipartite` and `ok` might be updated, but since the exact updates are not specified, we assume they could be modified in some way.

Given these assumptions, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which might be updated, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be updated, and `ok` might be updated.**
