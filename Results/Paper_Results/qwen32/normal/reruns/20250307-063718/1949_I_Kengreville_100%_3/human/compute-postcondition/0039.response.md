Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `1` values for all visited nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total accumulated value from the `dfs` calls, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite, and `ok` is `True` indicating that there was at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`.**
