The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the `i`-th element of the `coef` list. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[i]` which is `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `False`.**
