The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward: `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions within the initial state.
3. No calculations or evaluations of variables are needed to determine the output of this `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
