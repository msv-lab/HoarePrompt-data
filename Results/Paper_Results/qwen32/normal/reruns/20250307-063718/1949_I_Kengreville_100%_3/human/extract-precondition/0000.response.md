Precondition: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited. coef is a list of integers used to assign coefficients for bipartite checking. bipartite is a boolean value initialized to True, used to check if the graph formed by tangent disks is bipartite. tot is an integer used to accumulate the total of coefficients.**
