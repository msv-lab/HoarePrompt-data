The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `ok` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where each element is the first integer from the corresponding input, `y` is a list where each element is the second integer from the corresponding input, `r` is a list where each element is the third integer from the corresponding input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
