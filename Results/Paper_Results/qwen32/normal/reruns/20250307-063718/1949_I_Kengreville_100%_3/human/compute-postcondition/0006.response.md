The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is already defined as the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, the loop will definitely execute at least once as long as `n` is within this range. There is no need to adjust `n` because it is already guaranteed to be a valid value for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` is not defined yet, so we need to initialize it to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is 0**
