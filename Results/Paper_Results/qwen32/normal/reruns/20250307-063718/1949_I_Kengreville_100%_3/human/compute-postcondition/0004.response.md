Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially, which is an integer input by the user between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` retain their initial values of being lists of `None` values with length `n`. The `visited` list, which was initially a list of boolean values, is now specifically a list of `False` values with length `n`. The `coef` list remains unchanged as a list of `None` values.
