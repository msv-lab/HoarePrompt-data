The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to be a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This means the previous values in `y` (which were the integer coordinates of the center of the disks) are lost and replaced with `None` values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of positive integer radii of the i-th disk for `0 <= i < n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
