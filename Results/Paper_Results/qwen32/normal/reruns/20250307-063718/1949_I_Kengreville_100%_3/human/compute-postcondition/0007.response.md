The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the first elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `x` is a list where the first element is the first integer from the input and the rest are `None`, `y` is a list where the first element is the second integer from the input and the rest are `None`, `r` is a list where the first element is the third integer from the input and the rest are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is 0**.
