The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`. After executing this line, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 1000`; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk for `0 <= i < n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
