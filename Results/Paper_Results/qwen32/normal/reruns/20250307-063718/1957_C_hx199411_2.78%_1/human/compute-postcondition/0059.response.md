The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + 2` if `m > 1`, and `k` must be greater than 0.

Given that `i` is initialized to `m + 2` if `m > 1`, and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since `k` must be greater than 0 and controls the number of iterations, it does not need to be adjusted unless specified otherwise.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 3, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input after the split, and `r` is the second integer from the new input after the split**.
