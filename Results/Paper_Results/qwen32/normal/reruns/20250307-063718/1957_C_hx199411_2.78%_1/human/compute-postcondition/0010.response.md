Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer. `c` is not equal to `r`. `num` is increased by 2.**

This means that the values of `c` and `r` remain unchanged, and `num` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value.
