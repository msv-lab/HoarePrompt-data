To determine the new state after the given Python code snippet is executed, we need to focus on the calculation and update of the `dp[i]` variable. The other variables remain unchanged unless specifically modified.

Given:
- `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `m` is at least 2 and not equal to 0 or 1.
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7.
- `i` is 4

The code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Let's calculate the new value of `dp[4]`:
- `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[3]` which is 7.
- `(i - 1)` is `(4 - 1)` which is 3.
- `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `2` is a constant.

The expression becomes:
```python
dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = (7 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = 25 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = 25
```

The value of `dp[4]` is now 25. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is at least 2 and not equal to 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 4**.
