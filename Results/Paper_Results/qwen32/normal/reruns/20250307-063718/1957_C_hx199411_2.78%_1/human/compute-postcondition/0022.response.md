To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop:

- The loop iterates `k` times, where `k` is a given integer.
- In each iteration, two integers `c` and `r` are read from the input.
- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.

The loop will run exactly `k` times, and `num` will be updated based on the values of `c` and `r` read in each iteration. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `k` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= k <= n.
- `num` is 0.

After all iterations, the final state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `num` will be the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.

Since the specific values of `c` and `r` are not provided for all iterations, we can't determine the exact final value of `num`. However, we know how it is calculated based on the input.

Thus, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, and `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.**

In simpler terms, `num` will be the total increment accumulated based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
