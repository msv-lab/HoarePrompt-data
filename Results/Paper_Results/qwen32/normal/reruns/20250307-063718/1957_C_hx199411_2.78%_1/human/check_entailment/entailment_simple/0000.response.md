### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after playing k moves and considering the rules for placing rooks and the mirroring strategy of the computer.

Here are the key steps and logic in the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the chessboard) and `k` (the number of moves already played).
   - It then reads the `k` moves made by the player.

2. **Counting the Number of Moves:**
   - For each of the `k` moves, it checks if the move is of the form (r, r) where `r == c`. If so, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If the move is not of the form (r, r), it increments `num` by 2 (since the computer mirrors the move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining moves that can be made after accounting for the `k` moves and the computer's responses.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0, it prints 0 because no more moves can be made.
   - If `m` is 1, it prints 1 because there's only one possible configuration.
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations:
     - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` pairs of rooks.
     - It sets the base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - It then iterates from 3 to `m`, updating the DP array using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - Finally, it prints `dp[m]`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- **Execution:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 1`.
  - The move is (1, 2), so `num` is incremented by 2 (since it's not of the form (r, r)).
  - `m = n - num = 4 - 2 = 2`.
  - The DP array is initialized and updated:
    - `dp[1] = 1`
    - `dp[2] = (dp[1] + (2 - 1) * dp[0] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (1 + 1 * 0 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 3`
  - The output is `dp[2] = 3`.

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, calculates the remaining moves, and uses dynamic programming to determine the number of possible final configurations. The example provided matches the expected output, and there are no apparent issues with the logic or implementation.

**Correctness: True**
