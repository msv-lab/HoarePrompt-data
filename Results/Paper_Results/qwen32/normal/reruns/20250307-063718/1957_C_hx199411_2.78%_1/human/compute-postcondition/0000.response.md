Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The preconditions for `n` and `k` for each test case, as well as the details of the moves, remain unchanged.
