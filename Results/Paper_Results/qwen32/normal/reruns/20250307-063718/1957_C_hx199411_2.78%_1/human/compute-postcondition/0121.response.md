Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**

In natural language: The value of `dp[4]` has been updated to `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `i` remain unchanged.
