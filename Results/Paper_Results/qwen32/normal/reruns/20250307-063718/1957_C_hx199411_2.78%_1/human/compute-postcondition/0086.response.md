The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The condition `while t` means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is described as "truthy minus 1". For `t` to be truthy, it must be a non-zero value. Since `t` is "truthy minus 1", it means that before decrementing it by 1, it was at least 1. Therefore, to ensure that `t` remains truthy for the next iteration, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1 before the decrement.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`. If `m` is 0, `i` is not set to `m + 1`. If `m` is 1, `i` is set to 2. If `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 5, `dp` is updated to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`, and `i` is set to 6. `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified.**
