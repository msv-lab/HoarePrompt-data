### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Chessboard Setup**: An n x n chessboard where rooks cannot attack each other.
2. **Mirroring Moves**: After each player's move (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r). If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
3. **Initial Moves**: k moves have already been made, and we need to determine the number of possible final configurations.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9+7\).

#### Program Analysis Recap:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Moves**:
   - If r == c, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a move that doesn't require a mirror).
   - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a move that requires a mirror).
3. **Remaining Slots Calculation**: `m = n - num` represents the number of remaining slots that can be filled with rooks.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, so the output is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there's only one way to place the remaining rook, so the output is 1.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` remaining slots.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation considers placing a rook in one slot and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining slots, taking into account the mirroring rule.
5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**: n = 4, k = 1, move (1, 2)
   - `num` becomes 2 (one move that requires a mirror).
   - `m = 4 - 2 = 2`.
   - `dp[2] = 3` (from the base case).
   - Output: 3.

2. **Second Test Case**: n = 8, k = 1, move (7, 6)
   - `num` becomes 2.
   - `m = 8 - 2 = 6`.
   - `dp[6]` is calculated using the recurrence relation.
   - Output: 331.

3. **Third Test Case**: n = 1000, k = 4, moves (4, 4), (952, 343), (222, 333), (90, 91)
   - `num` becomes 6 (one move that doesn't require a mirror and three that do).
   - `m = 1000 - 6 = 994`.
   - `dp[994]` is calculated using the recurrence relation.
   - Output: 671968183.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Counting Moves**: The program correctly counts the number of moves that require a mirror (`num += 2`) and those that do not (`num += 1`). This is consistent with the problem description.
- **Remaining Slots Calculation**: The calculation `m = n - num` is correct, as it represents the number of remaining slots that can be filled with rooks.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
  - **Base Cases**: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct. For one slot, there is only one way to place a rook. For two slots, there are three ways (each slot can be filled independently, or they can be filled in a mirrored way).
  - **Recurrence Relation**: The relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct. It considers placing a rook in one slot and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining slots, taking into account the mirroring rule. The factor of 2 accounts for the two possible colors (white or black) for the first rook placed in the slot.

The dynamic programming approach correctly models the problem constraints and requirements.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification, the program appears to be correct. The logic and implementation align with the problem description and the provided examples.
