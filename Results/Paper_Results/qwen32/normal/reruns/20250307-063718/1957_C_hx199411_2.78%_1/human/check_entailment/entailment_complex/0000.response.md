### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves, taking into account the mirroring rules for the computer's moves. Here's a detailed analysis of the code:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the k moves, updating the count `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`) or not.

2. **Calculating `num`:**
   - `num` is incremented by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), meaning no mirroring occurs.
   - `num` is incremented by 2 if the move is not on the diagonal (`r != c`), meaning both the player and the computer make a move.

3. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board that are not occupied by rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - If `m == 0`, there are no valid configurations, so the result is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one valid configuration, so the result is 1.
   - For `m > 1`, the code uses a DP array to calculate the number of possible configurations. The DP relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2
     \]
     This relation accounts for the fact that a new rook can be placed in any of the `i` positions, and for each of these placements, the remaining `i-1` positions can be filled in `dp[i-2]` ways (considering the mirroring rule).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed immediately after processing.

### Correctness:

The code seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations based on the given rules and constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem efficiently, and the modulo operation ensures that the output is within the required range.

However, there is a small issue in the DP transition formula. The formula should be:
\[
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]
\]
The multiplication by 2 in the provided code is incorrect because it overcounts the configurations. Each pair of positions (r, c) and (c, r) is counted only once.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided code is mostly correct but has an issue with the DP transition formula. The correct formula should not include the multiplication by 2.

**Correctness: False** (due to the incorrect DP transition formula)

To make the code correct, the DP transition formula should be adjusted as follows:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

After making this correction, the code would be correct.
