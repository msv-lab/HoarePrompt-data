Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= k <= n; `num` is 0.**
The variable `num` is assigned the value 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) retain their initial values.
