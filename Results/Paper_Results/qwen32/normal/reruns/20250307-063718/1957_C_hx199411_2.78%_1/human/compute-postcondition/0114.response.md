Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `i` is equal to `k`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`; `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1**
