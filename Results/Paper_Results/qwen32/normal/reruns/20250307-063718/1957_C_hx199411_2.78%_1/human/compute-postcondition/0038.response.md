To determine the new state, we need to calculate the value of `dp[i]` using the given formula and then update the `dp` list accordingly. Here are the details:

Given:
- `i` is 5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except for the specified indices.

The formula to update `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Plugging in the values for `i = 5`:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \]

Therefore, the `dp` list will now have `dp[5]` updated to 81. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81, `i` is 5**
