The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not been specified, but we know it must have been one less than `k` for the loop to have just ended. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Since the values of `c`, `r`, and `num` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, for completeness, we can note that their values remain the same.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2. `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `k` remains unchanged.** 

To make it more precise in terms of the variables in the loop head:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged.**
