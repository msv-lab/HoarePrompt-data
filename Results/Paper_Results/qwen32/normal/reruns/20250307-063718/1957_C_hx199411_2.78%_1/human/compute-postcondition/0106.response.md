Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input; `i` is 4. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3; otherwise, `num` is 5. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3; otherwise, `num` is 6. However, since `num` is set to 3 if `c == r` and 4 if `c != r` in the if and else parts respectively, the correct value of `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r` and 4 if `c` is not equal to `r`.**

To simplify, the overall postcondition can be stated as:
Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input; `i` is 4. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3; otherwise, `num` is 4.**
