The code snippet simply resets the value of `num` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, and `i` is set to `m + 1` if `m > 1`.**
