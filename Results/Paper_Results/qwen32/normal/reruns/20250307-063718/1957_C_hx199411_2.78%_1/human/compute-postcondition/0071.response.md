Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is defined as `truthy - 1`, but the value of `truthy` is not specified.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `num` is defined as `k + y`, where `y` is the number of times `c != r`. The values of `c` and `r` are not specified.
   - `m` is defined as `n - (k + y)`. Given that the current value of `m` is 1, this equation holds true for the current state.
   - `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except for specific indices which are set to specific values (1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 281, 1063). Since `m` is 1, `dp` will be `[0, 1]`.
   - `i` is defined as `m + 1` if `m > 1`. Since `m` is 1, `i` will not be set to `m + 1` and its value is not specified from the given information.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The provided code snippet is simply `print(1)`. This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of any other variables in the program.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
