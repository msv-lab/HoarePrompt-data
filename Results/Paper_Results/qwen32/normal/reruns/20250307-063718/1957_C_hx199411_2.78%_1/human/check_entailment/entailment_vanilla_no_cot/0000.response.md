Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a mistake in the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) formula used to compute the number of configurations is incorrect. 

The DP formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly account for the number of ways to place the remaining rooks. The correct approach involves understanding that the remaining rooks can be placed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem (no two rooks in the same row or column), and this is a known combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of derangements or directly calculating the number of permutations of the remaining rows and columns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of ways to place m rooks on an m x m board such that no two rooks attack each other
            # is m! (m factorial)
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, m + 1):
                result = (result * i) % MOD
            print(result)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the number of ways to place the remaining rooks is simply the factorial of `m`, which correctly accounts for the number of permutations of the remaining rows and columns. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the constraints given in the problem.
