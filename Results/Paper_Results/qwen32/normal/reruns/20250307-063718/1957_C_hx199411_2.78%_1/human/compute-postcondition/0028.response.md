The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` as described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides details about variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`. However, these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
