The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is `n - num`.**
