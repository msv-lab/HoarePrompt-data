The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must be at least 5 (since `i` is currently 4 and needs to be less than `m + 1`).

State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 5**
