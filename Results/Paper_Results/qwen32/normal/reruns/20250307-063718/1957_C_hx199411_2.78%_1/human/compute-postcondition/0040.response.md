Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `dp[m]` that will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same, but their specific values are not mentioned, so we don't need to consider them for this output.
2. `num` is calculated based on the iteration conditions, but it is not used in the `print(dp[m])` statement, so we can ignore it.
3. `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1.
4. `dp` is a list initialized as follows:
   - `dp[0]` to `dp[4]` are not explicitly given, but we know `dp[1]` to `dp[7]`.
   - `dp[1] = 1`
   - `dp[2] = 3`
   - `dp[3] = 7`
   - `dp[4] = 25`
   - `dp[5] = 81`
   - `dp[6] = 281`
   - `dp[7] = 1063`
5. `i` is set to `m + 1`, but it is not used in the `print(dp[m])` statement, so we can ignore it.

The task is to print `dp[m]`. Since `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1, and given the values of `dp` from `dp[1]` to `dp[7]`, we can directly determine the value of `dp[m]` based on the value of `m`.

Since `m` is at least 5, the possible values for `dp[m]` from the given list are:
- If `m = 5`, `dp[m] = 81`
- If `m = 6`, `dp[m] = 281`
- If `m = 7`, `dp[m] = 1063`

However, without a specific value for `m`, we can only describe the output in terms of `m`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value in the dp list at index m, and m is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1)**

Given the information, if we assume `m` is one of the values for which we have an explicit `dp` value, we can provide the specific value. However, without loss of generality and based on the given information, the most precise description is:

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value in the dp list at index m, and m is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1)**

If we assume the smallest possible value for `m` which is 5, then:

Output: **81**
