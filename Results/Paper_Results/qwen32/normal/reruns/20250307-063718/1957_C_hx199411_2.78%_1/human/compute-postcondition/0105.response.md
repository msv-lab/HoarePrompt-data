The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. Therefore, after `num += 2`, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` becomes 4, and if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` becomes 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input; `num` is 4 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 6; `i` is 4.**
