The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `m` is at least 2 and not equal to 0 or 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `m` must be at least 5 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 5**
