The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of the variable `num` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the initial value of `num`, we can only state that `num` is incremented by 1. The values of `c` and `r` remain unchanged, and the condition that `c` is equal to `r` still holds.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer. The current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`. `num` is incremented by 1.**
