The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(0)` statement explicitly prints the number `0`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **0**
