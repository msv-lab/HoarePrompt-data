The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `c` and `r`. Since the specific input values are not provided, we can only express that `c` and `r` will hold the integer values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer.**
