The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` and `k` have specific constraints. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= k <= n.**
