The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `m` must be at least 5.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 5**
