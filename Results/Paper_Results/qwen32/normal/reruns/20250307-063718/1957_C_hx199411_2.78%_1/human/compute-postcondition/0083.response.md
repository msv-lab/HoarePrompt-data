Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is truthy minus 1. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input. However, `n` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input. However, `k` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.
   - `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`. However, `num` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.
   - `m` is 5.
   - `dp` is `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`.
   - `i` is 6. However, `i` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(dp[m])
   ```
   - The print statement accesses the element at index `m` in the list `dp`.

3. **Determine the Value to be Printed:**
   - `m` is given as 5.
   - The list `dp` is `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`.
   - The element at index 5 in the list `dp` is 81.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 81.

Output: **81**
