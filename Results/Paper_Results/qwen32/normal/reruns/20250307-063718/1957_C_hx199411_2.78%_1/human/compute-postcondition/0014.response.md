The value of `num` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `num` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is increased by 1.**
