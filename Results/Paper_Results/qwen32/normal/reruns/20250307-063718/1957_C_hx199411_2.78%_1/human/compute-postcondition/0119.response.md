Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is equal to `k`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` must be at least 3.**

In natural language, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
