The value of `dp[2]` is set to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is `n - (k + y)`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is `m + 1` if `m > 1`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
