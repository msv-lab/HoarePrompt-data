Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same. `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`. `m` is `n - num` and is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the program does not modify `dp`. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, and `i` is set to `m + 1`.**
