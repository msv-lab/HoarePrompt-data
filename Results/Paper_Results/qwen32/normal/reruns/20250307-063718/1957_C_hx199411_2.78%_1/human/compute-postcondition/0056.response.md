Initial State: `t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, `i` is `m + 2` if `m > 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input after the split, and `r` is the second integer from the new input after the split. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1; otherwise, `num` is set to 2.

Code:
```
num += 1
```

Impact: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` can either be 1 or 2 before this operation. If `num` was 1, it becomes 2. If `num` was 2, it becomes 3.
