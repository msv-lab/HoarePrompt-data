Output State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is `n - (k + y)`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `i` is `m + 1` if `m > 1`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

In simple terms, the value at index 1 of the list `dp` has been changed to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
