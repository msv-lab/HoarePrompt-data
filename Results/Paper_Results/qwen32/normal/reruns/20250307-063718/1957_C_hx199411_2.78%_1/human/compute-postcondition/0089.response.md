The code snippet sets `num` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `num` changes from `k + y` to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 0, if `m` is 0, `i` is not set to `m + 1`. If `m` is 1, `i` is set to 2. If `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 5, `dp` is updated to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`, and `i` is set to 6. `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified.**
