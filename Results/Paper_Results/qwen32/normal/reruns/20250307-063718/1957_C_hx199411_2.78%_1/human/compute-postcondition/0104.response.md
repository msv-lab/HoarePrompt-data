The given code snippet increments the variable `num` by 1. The value of `num` was initially set to 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` was set to 4. After the increment, if `num` was initially 2, it will now be 3, and if `num` was initially 4, it will now be 5. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input; `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 5; `i` is 4.**
