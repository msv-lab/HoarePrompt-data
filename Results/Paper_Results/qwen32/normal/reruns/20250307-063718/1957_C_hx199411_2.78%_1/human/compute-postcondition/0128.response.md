To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Loop Control:**
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - `num` is initialized to 0 and is incremented based on the values of `c` and `r` from the next `k` lines of input.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - If `m` is 0, the output is 0.
   - If `m` is 1, the output is 1.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is used to compute the result.
     - `dp` is initialized with zeros of length `m + 1`.
     - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
     - `dp[2]` is set to 3.
     - For `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is computed using the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
   - The final output for each test case is `dp[m]`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After all `t` test cases have been processed, `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` will be in their final state for the last test case processed.
   - The output for each test case is printed immediately after processing, so the final output state does not retain any specific values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, or `dp` from the previous test cases.

Given the above understanding, the final output state after all executions of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is 0.**

This means that the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and `t` is now 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The state of other variables like `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` will reflect the state after processing the last test case, but they are not retained across different test cases in the final state.
