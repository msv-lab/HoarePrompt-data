Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `dp[1]` has been changed to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
