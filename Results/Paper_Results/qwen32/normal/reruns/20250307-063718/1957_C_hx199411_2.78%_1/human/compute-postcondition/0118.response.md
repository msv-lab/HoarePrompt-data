The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `m + 1` is greater than 3, which means `m` must be at least 3. 

Given that `i` is initially set to `k`, the value of `i` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing, as the loop head does not depend on the initial value of `i` for its execution. The loop will start with `i` equal to 3, regardless of the initial value of `k`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is equal to `k`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` must be at least 3**
