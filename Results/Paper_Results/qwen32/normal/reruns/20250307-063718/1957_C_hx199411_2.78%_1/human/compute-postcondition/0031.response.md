The code snippet sets the value of `dp[1]` to 1. This affects the `dp` list, which was initially a list of zeros with length `m + 1`. No other variables are changed by this code.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1.**
