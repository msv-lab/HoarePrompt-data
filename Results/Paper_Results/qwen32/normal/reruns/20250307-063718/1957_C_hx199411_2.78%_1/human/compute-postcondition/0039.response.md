To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the conditions given. 

The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating the `dp` list according to the formula:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can see that:
- `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `num` is calculated based on the conditions `c == r` and `c != r`.
- `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1.
- `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and subsequent values are calculated as shown.

Given the values after 3 iterations, we can continue the calculation to the end of the loop. Let's calculate the values for `dp[6]` and `dp[7]` since `m` is at least 5, implying the loop will run up to `i = 5`. However, to be thorough, I'll calculate up to `i = 7` to ensure we cover possible higher values of `m`.

Here are the calculations:

- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 7`
- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 25`
- `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 81`
- `dp[6] = (dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (81 + 5 * 25 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 281`
- `dp[7] = (dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (281 + 6 * 81 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 1063`

Assuming `m` is 5, the loop will stop after `i = 5`. However, to be thorough, let's assume `m` could be higher and include `dp[6]` and `dp[7]` in the output state.

Output State: **t remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, num is the sum of 1 for each iteration where c == r and 2 for each iteration where c != r, m is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1, dp is a list of zeros with length m + 1 except dp[1] which is 1, dp[2] which is 3, dp[3] which is 7, dp[4] which is 25, dp[5] which is 81, dp[6] which is 281, dp[7] which is 1063, i is m + 1.**

In natural language: The final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `num` is calculated based on the conditions `c == r` and `c != r`. The variable `m` is at least 5 and not equal to 0 or 1. The `dp` list is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and subsequent values are `dp[3] = 7`, `dp[4] = 25`, `dp[5] = 81`, `dp[6] = 281`, and `dp[7] = 1063`. The loop variable `i` will be `m + 1` after the loop completes.
