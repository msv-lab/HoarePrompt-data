Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `dp` is initialized as a list containing `m + 1` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged.
