The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is either 1 or 2 based on whether `c` is equal to `r`. After the increment, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 3.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is at least 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified.
- `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `c` and `r` are the two integers from the input; `num` is either 2 or 3; `i` is incremented by 1.**
