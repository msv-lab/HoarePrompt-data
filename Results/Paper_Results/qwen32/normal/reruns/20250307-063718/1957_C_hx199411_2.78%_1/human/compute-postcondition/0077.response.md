To determine the output state, we need to focus on the specific changes made by the line of code provided. Here's the breakdown:

The line of code:
```
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is truthy minus 1 (we don't need to use this value for the current line of code).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (we don't need to use this value for the current line of code).
- `k` is the second integer from the input (we don't need to use this value for the current line of code).
- `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r` (we don't need to use this value for the current line of code).
- `m` is at least 3 (we don't need to use this value for the current line of code).
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `i` is 3.

The code updates `dp[i]` where `i` is 3. To find the new value of `dp[3]`, we use the given formula:
```
dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Substituting the known values:
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `i` is 3.

Therefore:
```
dp[3] = (3 + (3 - 1) * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = 7
```

The only change is the value of `dp[3]` which is now 7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7, `i` is 3.**
