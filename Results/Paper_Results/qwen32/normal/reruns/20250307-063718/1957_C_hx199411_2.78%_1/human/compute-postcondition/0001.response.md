To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `t` in the loop condition `while t:`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and thus non-zero, meaning the loop can certainly execute at least once without any modifications.

Since `t` is already within the range that ensures the loop will execute, no adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed to its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
