To determine the output of the `print(dp[m])` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is at least 0 (not directly relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `dp` is a list initialized with specific values: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 7`, `dp[4] = 25`, `dp[5] = 81`, and all other elements (from `dp[0]` to `dp[m]`) are 0 except the specified indices.
   - `i` is 6 (not directly relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement).
   - `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1.

2. **Variables and Calculation:**
   - The value of `m` is determined by `n - num`. Since `m` is not 0 or 1, it implies that `m` could be any integer from 2 to 5 (inclusive), based on the given `dp` list indices that have specific values.
   - The `dp` list is explicitly defined for indices 1 through 5. For any `m` outside this range, `dp[m]` would be 0, but since `m` is constrained to be 2 through 5, we only need to consider those specific values.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]` where `m` is calculated as `n - num` and is constrained to be between 2 and 5.
   - Given the specific values in the `dp` list, the output will be `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, or `dp[5]` depending on the value of `m`.

Therefore, the exact output depends on the value of `m` which is derived from `n` and `num`. Since the exact values of `n` and `num` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of `m`.

Output: **dp[m] (where m is n - num and m is between 2 and 5, inclusive)**

Given the specific values in the `dp` list, the output can be one of the following:
- If `m = 2`, Output: **3**
- If `m = 3`, Output: **7**
- If `m = 4`, Output: **25**
- If `m = 5`, Output: **81**

Since the exact value of `m` is not specified, we provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **dp[m] (where m is n - num and m is between 2 and 5, inclusive)**
