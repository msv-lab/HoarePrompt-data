The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3 because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `m + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `m + 1` if `m > 1`.
- `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3. Additionally, `i` should be set to 3 initially to start the loop from the first iteration.

State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is 3**
