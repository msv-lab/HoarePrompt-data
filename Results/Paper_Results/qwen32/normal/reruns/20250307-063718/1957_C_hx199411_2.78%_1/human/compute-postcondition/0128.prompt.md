Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same. `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`. `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further modifications are made. If `m` is 1, `dp` is not modified. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, and `i` is set to `m + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`. If `m` is 0, `i` is not set to `m + 1`. If `m` is 1, `i` is set to 2. If `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 5, `dp` is updated to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`, and `i` is set to 6. `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, unless `m` is greater than 1, in which case `dp` is updated as specified; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the input values `c` and `r` over `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to 0, and if `m` is 1, `i` is set to `k`; otherwise, `i` is set to 6.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
