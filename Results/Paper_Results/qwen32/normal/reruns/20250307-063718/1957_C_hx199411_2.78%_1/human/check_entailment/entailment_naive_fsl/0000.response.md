Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for all possible configurations of the chessboard after the initial k moves. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints and requirements.

The main issue lies in how the program calculates the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is not derived from a correct understanding of the problem. The formula does not correctly handle the mirroring of moves and the placement of rooks in such a way that no two rooks attack each other.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
3 1
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
After the first move (1, 2) by the player, the computer will place a rook at (2, 1). The board looks like this:
```
. . .
R . .
. R .
```
The player can now place a rook at (3, 3) or (3, 1) or (1, 3):
1. If the player places a rook at (3, 3), the board is:
```
. . .
R . .
. R R
```
2. If the player places a rook at (3, 1), the board is:
```
. . .
R . .
R R .
```
3. If the player places a rook at (1, 3), the board is:
```
. . R
R . .
. R .
```
These are the only valid configurations, and there are 3 of them.

However, the provided code will not output 3 for this input. The dynamic programming approach used does not correctly calculate the number of valid configurations.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, taking into account the constraints and requirements of the problem, such as the mirroring of moves and the placement of rooks without any two attacking each other.
