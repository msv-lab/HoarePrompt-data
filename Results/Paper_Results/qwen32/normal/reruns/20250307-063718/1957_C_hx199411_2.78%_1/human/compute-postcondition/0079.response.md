To calculate the output state, we need to evaluate the provided Python code snippet in the context of the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is truthy minus 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`
- `m` is at least 3
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7
- `i` is 4

Let's substitute the values into the equation:

- `dp[i]` is `dp[4]`
- `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[3]`, which is 7
- `i - 1` is 3
- `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[2]`, which is 3
- The expression to calculate `dp[4]` becomes:
  \[
  dp[4] = (dp[3] + (i - 1) * dp[2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) = 25 \% (10^9 + 7) = 25
  \]

Thus, `dp[4]` is updated to 25. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 4**.
