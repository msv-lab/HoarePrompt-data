Postcondition: **`t` is truthy minus 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 281, `dp[7]` which is 1063, and `i` is `m + 1` if `m > 1`. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` is set to 5, `dp` is updated to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`, and `i` is set to 6. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0.**
