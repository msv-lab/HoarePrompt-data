To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to consider the loop head and the variables involved in it. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` must be greater than 0**
