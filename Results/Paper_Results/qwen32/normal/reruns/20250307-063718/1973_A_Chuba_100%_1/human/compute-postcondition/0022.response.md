Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a value indicating the outcome based on the scores: if `p_3` is greater than `p_2` by more than 2 points, it returns "Player 3 wins by a margin"; otherwise, it returns "No clear winner".**
