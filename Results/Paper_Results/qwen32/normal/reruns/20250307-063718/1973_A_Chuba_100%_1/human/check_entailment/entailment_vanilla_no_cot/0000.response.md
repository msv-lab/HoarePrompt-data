To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step against the problem description and the given examples.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`).

2. **Sum of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from games (each game contributing 2 points, either 2 to one player or 1 to each in case of a draw) must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores can be achieved through valid games.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program using the provided examples.

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```
0 0 0
```
**Output:**
```
0
```
**Explanation:**
- No games were played, so no draws could have occurred. The sum `0 + 0 + 0` is even, and the formula correctly returns `0`.

#### Example 2
**Input:**
```
0 1 1
```
**Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation:**
- One game was played, resulting in a draw between the second and third player. The sum `0 + 1 + 1` is even, and the formula correctly returns `1`.

#### Example 3
**Input:**
```
1 1 1
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```
**Explanation:**
- It's impossible to achieve these scores with valid games. The sum `1 + 1 + 1` is odd, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

#### Example 4
**Input:**
```
1 1 2
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
- Two games were played, with one draw and one win. The sum `1 + 1 + 2` is even, and the formula correctly returns `2`.

#### Example 5
**Input:**
```
3 3 3
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```
**Explanation:**
- It's impossible to achieve these scores with valid games. The sum `3 + 3 + 3` is odd, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

#### Example 6
**Input:**
```
3 4 5
```
**Output:**
```
6
```
**Explanation:**
- Multiple games were played, with a combination of wins and draws leading to these scores. The sum `3 + 4 + 5` is even, and the formula correctly returns `6`.

#### Example 7
**Input:**
```
1 1 10
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
- Multiple games were played, with a combination of wins and draws leading to these scores. The sum `1 + 1 + 10` is even, and the formula correctly returns `2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the provided examples and adheres to the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
