The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('-1')`. This statement simply prints the string `'-1'` to the console.

The initial state provides information about the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `v`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
