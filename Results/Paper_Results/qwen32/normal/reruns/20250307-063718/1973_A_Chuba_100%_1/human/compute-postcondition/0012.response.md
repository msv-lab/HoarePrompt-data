To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `result` based on the given variables and conditions. Here's the breakdown:

- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers with the condition `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and must be decremented by 1.
- `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The expression to evaluate is:
```
result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the sum of the first three elements of the list `v`.
- `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the value is non-negative. If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it will be 0; otherwise, it will be `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`.
- The result is then divided by 2 using integer division (`//`).

The value of `result` depends on the specific values of `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`. However, we can derive a general form for the result based on the expression.

After evaluating the expression, the value of `t` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `result` is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.**
