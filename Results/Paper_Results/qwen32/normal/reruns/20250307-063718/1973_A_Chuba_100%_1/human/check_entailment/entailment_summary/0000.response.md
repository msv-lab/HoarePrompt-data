Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the scores of three players after playing a series of chess games. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Input Validation**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the players. It is given that the scores are in non-decreasing order (p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3).

2. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores because each game results in an even total of points (either 0+2=2 for a win-lose scenario or 1+1=2 for a draw). Hence, the program correctly outputs `-1` in this case.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. The formula used for this calculation is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) - \max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)}{2}
   \]
   - The term `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3)` represents the total points accumulated by all players.
   - The term `max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)` ensures that we do not subtract a negative value, which would incorrectly increase the number of draws. This term essentially checks if the highest score (p_3) is more than the sum of the other two scores (p_0 + p_1). If it is, then the excess points (p_3 - p_0 - p_1) must have come from wins rather than draws.
   - The result is then divided by 2 because each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

4. **Example Verification**: Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the formula gives `result = (0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) / 2 = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the formula gives `result = (0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) / 2 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the output is `-1`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the formula gives `result = (1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2`, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the output is `-1`, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the formula gives `result = (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) / 2 = 6`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the formula gives `result = (1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2`, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
