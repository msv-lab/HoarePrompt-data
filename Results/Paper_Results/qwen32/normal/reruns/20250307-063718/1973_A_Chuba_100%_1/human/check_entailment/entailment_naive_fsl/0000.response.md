Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, there is a scenario where the program will output an incorrect result. Let's analyze the logic:

The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from games (where each game contributes either 2 points in total or 2 points split as 1+1 in case of a draw) must be even. This part is correct.

However, the calculation for the maximum number of draws is incorrect in some cases. The formula used:
```python
result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
```
does not correctly account for all possible distributions of wins and draws that could lead to the given scores.

Let's consider a specific test case where the program fails:
- Input: `0 3 5`
- Expected Output: `-1`
- Program Output: `2`

Explanation for why the program is incorrect for this case:
- The total points are `0 + 3 + 5 = 8`, which is even, so the program does not immediately return `-1`.
- The formula calculates `result = (0 + 3 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 0 - 3)) // 2 = (8 - max(0, 2)) // 2 = (8 - 2) // 2 = 3`.
- However, it is impossible to have scores of `0`, `3`, and `5` with any number of games. The highest score a player can get is `6` (if they win all three games they play), and the only way to get a score of `5` is if a player wins two games and draws one, which would require the other players to have scores of `1` and `2`, not `0` and `3`.

Thus, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws for this scenario and does not correctly identify that the scores are inconsistent.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
