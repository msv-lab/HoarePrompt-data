Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is the number of test cases. The initial state of the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remains unchanged as they are part of the test case data and not affected by this line of code.
