### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws among three players given their final scores in chess games. The key to solving this problem is understanding the constraints and the implications of the scores.

1. **Sum of Scores**: The sum of the scores must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 for a win/loss or 1-1 for a draw). If the total sum of the scores is odd, it's impossible to have achieved those scores through a series of valid games, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Calculating Draws**: If the sum of the scores is even, we need to calculate the maximum number of draws. The formula used in the program `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is derived from the following logic:
   - The total points from wins and draws is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` calculates the minimum points that must have come from wins (since `v[2]` is the highest score and `v[0]` and `v[1]` are the other two scores). If `v[2]` is greater than the sum of the other two scores, the difference represents points that must have come from wins.
   - Subtracting this minimum number of win points from the total points gives us the maximum possible points that could have come from draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives us the number of draws because each draw awards 2 points in total.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as all scores being zero (no games played) and scenarios where no valid set of games can produce the given scores.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum: `0` (even)
   - Draws: `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum: `2` (even)
   - Draws: `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum: `4` (even)
   - Draws: `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the logic and constraints of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
