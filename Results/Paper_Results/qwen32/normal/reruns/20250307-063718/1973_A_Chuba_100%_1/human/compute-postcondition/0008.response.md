Postcondition: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, and `result` is an integer equal to the sum of the two smallest numbers among `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` divided by 2.**
