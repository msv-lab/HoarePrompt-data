The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet simply outputs the string `-1`, regardless of the values of the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, or the list `v`.

Here is the breakdown of the information provided in the initial state:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3` are integers with the condition \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `v` is a list of integers.
- The sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd.

However, none of these variables or conditions influence the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **-1**
