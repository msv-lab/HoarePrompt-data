The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `v`. The initial state of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
