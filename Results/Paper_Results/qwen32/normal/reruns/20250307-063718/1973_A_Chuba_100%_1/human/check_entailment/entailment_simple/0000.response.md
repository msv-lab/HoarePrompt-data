### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in chess games, adhering to the constraints and conditions outlined in the problem statement.

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1` because the total points from games must be even (since each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded, either as 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Calculation of Draws**: If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the need to maximize draws while ensuring the scores are achievable through a series of games.

3. **Explanation of the Formula**:
   - The term `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` represents the total points awarded in all games.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` adjusts for the scenario where the highest scorer (`v[2]`) has a score that is significantly higher than the sum of the other two scores (`v[0]` and `v[1]`). This ensures that the difference can be attributed to wins rather than draws.
   - The division by 2 accounts for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when no games are played (`0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws.
   - It also correctly identifies impossible score combinations, such as `1 1 1`, where the total score is odd, and outputs `-1`.
   - The formula used ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly for valid score combinations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, handling both valid and invalid score combinations appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
