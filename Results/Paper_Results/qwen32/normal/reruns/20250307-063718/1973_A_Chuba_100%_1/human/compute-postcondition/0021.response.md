To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each set of inputs. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes a set of three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`. The logic of the loop is as follows:

1. If the sum of the three integers is odd, it prints `-1`.
2. If the sum of the three integers is even, it calculates the result as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and prints this result.

The initial state provided includes the scores of three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and the number of test cases `t`. These values do not change during the execution of the loop. The loop only processes the inputs provided in each iteration.

After all `t` iterations, the only variable that will have changed is `t` itself, as it will be decremented until it reaches 0. However, since `t` is only used to control the number of iterations, it does not affect the final output state in terms of the results printed.

The final output state will simply be the results printed for each iteration, which are either `-1` or the calculated result based on the logic described above.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, and given that the output state is defined by the results printed, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

Output State: **The final output state is the sequence of results printed for each of the `t` iterations, where each result is either `-1` if the sum of the three input integers is odd, or the calculated result `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` if the sum is even.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the series of printed results from each iteration of the loop.
