### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the logic behind the formula used to determine the maximum number of draws.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have three players with scores \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- Each game results in either 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 point each in case of a draw.
- We need to determine the maximum number of draws or conclude if the scores are impossible.

#### Key Points in the Solution:
1. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - If the sum of the scores \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) is odd, it is impossible to achieve those scores because each game contributes an even number of points (either 2 or 2). Thus, the program correctly returns `-1` in this case.

2. **Even Sum Calculation**:
   - When the sum is even, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the number of games where one player wins against another.

#### Analysis of the Formula:
- **Understanding the Formula**:
  - The term \( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] \) is the total points scored.
  - The term \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \) calculates the excess points that the highest scorer \( v[2] \) has over the sum of the other two scores \( v[0] + v[1] \). If \( v[2] \) has more points than \( v[0] + v[1] \), it indicates that \( v[2] \) must have won some games against the other two players.
  - Subtracting this excess from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

- **Validation with Examples**:
  - **Example 1: 0 0 0**
    - Sum is 0 (even).
    - No games were played, so `result` is 0.
    - Output: 0 (Correct)

  - **Example 2: 0 1 1**
    - Sum is 2 (even).
    - Maximum number of draws is 1 (one draw between the second and third player).
    - Output: 1 (Correct)

  - **Example 3: 1 1 1**
    - Sum is 3 (odd).
    - Output: -1 (Correct)

  - **Example 4: 1 1 2**
    - Sum is 4 (even).
    - Maximum number of draws is 2 (one draw between the second and third player, and one game where the third player wins against the first player).
    - Output: 2 (Correct)

  - **Example 5: 3 3 3**
    - Sum is 9 (odd).
    - Output: -1 (Correct)

  - **Example 6: 3 4 5**
    - Sum is 12 (even).
    - Maximum number of draws is 6 (six draws between the players).
    - Output: 6 (Correct)

  - **Example 7: 1 1 10**
    - Sum is 12 (even).
    - Maximum number of draws is 2 (two draws and one game where the third player wins against the first and second players).
    - Output: 2 (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly handles the provided examples and adheres to the logic required by the problem statement. The formula used calculates the maximum number of draws accurately and handles the odd sum case correctly.
