The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `v`. This operation does not affect the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, or `t`. The condition regarding the sum of the first three elements of `v` and the calculation of `result` are not executed based on the given snippet, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is `t`, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
