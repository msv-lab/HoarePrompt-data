The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `v` as defined in the initial state. The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables; it simply outputs the string `'-1'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **-1**
