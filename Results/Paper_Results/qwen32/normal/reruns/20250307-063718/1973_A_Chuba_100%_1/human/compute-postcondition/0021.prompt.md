Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
        print('-1')
    else:
        result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
        print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, and `result` is an integer equal to the sum of the two smallest numbers among `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the state remains as described. Otherwise, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (0 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (0 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) with the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, `t` is `t`, and `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the state remains as described. Otherwise, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
