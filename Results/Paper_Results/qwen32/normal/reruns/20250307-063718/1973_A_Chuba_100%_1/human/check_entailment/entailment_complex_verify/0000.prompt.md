You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The final output state is the sequence of results printed for each of the `t` iterations, where each result is either `-1` if the sum of the three input integers is odd, or the calculated result `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` if the sum is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the scores. The output for each test case is printed sequentially.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, there is a scenario where the program will output an incorrect result. Let's analyze the logic:

The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from games (where each game contributes either 2 points in total or 2 points split as 1+1 in case of a draw) must be even. This part is correct.

However, the calculation for the maximum number of draws is incorrect in some cases. The formula used:
```python
result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
```
does not correctly account for all possible distributions of wins and draws that could lead to the given scores.

Let's consider a specific test case where the program fails:
- Input: `0 3 5`
- Expected Output: `-1`
- Program Output: `2`

Explanation for why the program is incorrect for this case:
- The total points are `0 + 3 + 5 = 8`, which is even, so the program does not immediately return `-1`.
- The formula calculates `result = (0 + 3 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 0 - 3)) // 2 = (8 - max(0, 2)) // 2 = (8 - 2) // 2 = 3`.
- However, it is impossible to have scores of `0`, `3`, and `5` with any number of games. The highest score a player can get is `6` (if they win all three games they play), and the only way to get a score of `5` is if a player wins two games and draws one, which would require the other players to have scores of `1` and `2`, not `0` and `3`.

Thus, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws for this scenario and does not correctly identify that the scores are inconsistent.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
