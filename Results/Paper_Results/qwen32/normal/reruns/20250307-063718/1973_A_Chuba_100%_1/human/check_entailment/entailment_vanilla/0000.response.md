Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games. The key points are:
1. Each game results in either 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 point each in case of a draw.
2. The scores of the players are provided in non-decreasing order.
3. We need to find the maximum number of draws or determine if the given scores are not possible.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case:
1. It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible (since each game contributes an even number of points, either 2 or 2).
2. If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the number of games where one player wins against another.

### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the solution using the provided examples.

1. **Example 1: 0 0 0**
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so `result` is 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Example 2: 0 1 1**
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 1 (one draw between the second and third player).
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Example 3: 1 1 1**
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

4. **Example 4: 1 1 2**
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 2 (one draw between the second and third player, and one game where the third player wins against the first player).
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Example 5: 3 3 3**
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

6. **Example 6: 3 4 5**
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 6 (six draws between the players).
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Example 7: 1 1 10**
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 2 (two draws and one game where the third player wins against the first and second players).
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the logic required by the problem statement. 

Correctness: **True**
