You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the scores. The output for each test case is printed sequentially.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games. The key points are:
1. Each game results in either 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 point each in case of a draw.
2. The scores of the players are provided in non-decreasing order.
3. We need to find the maximum number of draws or determine if the given scores are not possible.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case:
1. It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible (since each game contributes an even number of points, either 2 or 2).
2. If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the number of games where one player wins against another.

### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the solution using the provided examples.

1. **Example 1: 0 0 0**
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so `result` is 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Example 2: 0 1 1**
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 1 (one draw between the second and third player).
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Example 3: 1 1 1**
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

4. **Example 4: 1 1 2**
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 2 (one draw between the second and third player, and one game where the third player wins against the first player).
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Example 5: 3 3 3**
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

6. **Example 6: 3 4 5**
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 6 (six draws between the players).
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Example 7: 1 1 10**
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Maximum number of draws is 2 (two draws and one game where the third player wins against the first and second players).
   - Output: 2 (Correct)
