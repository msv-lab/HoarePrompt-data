To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and compute the value of `result`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`**:
   - These are integers within the range 0 to 30.
   - They satisfy the condition `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3`.

2. **Variable `t`**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.

3. **List `v`**:
   - `v` is a list of integers.
   - The sum of the first three elements of `v` is even.

4. **Variable `result`**:
   - `result` is an integer equal to the sum of the two smallest numbers among `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` divided by 2.

### Calculation of `result`:
- The `result` is calculated based on the two smallest numbers among the first three elements of the list `v`.
- Since the sum of `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` is even, the sum of the two smallest numbers among these three must also be even (because the sum of three numbers is even if and only if the sum of the two smallest numbers is even, or the three numbers are all even).

### Explanation:
- Let's denote the first three elements of `v` as `a`, `b`, and `c` where `a ≤ b ≤ c`.
- The `result` is calculated as `(a + b) / 2`.
- Since `a` and `b` are the two smallest numbers and their sum is even, `(a + b) / 2` will be an integer.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will output the integer value of `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the two smallest numbers among the first three elements of the list `v`.

Output: **result (where result is the integer value of (a + b) / 2, with a and b being the two smallest numbers among v[0], v[1], and v[2])**
