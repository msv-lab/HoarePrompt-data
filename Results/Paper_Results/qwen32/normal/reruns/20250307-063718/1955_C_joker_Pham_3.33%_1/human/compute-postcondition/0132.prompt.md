Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then if `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. The updated value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`. If `a[l]` is not 0, the updated value of `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[r] < a[l]` and neither of the above conditions are met, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged and the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing the state of the variables. If `a[r] < a[l]`, `r` is decreased by 1 if `k >= a[r] * 2`. Otherwise, if `a[r] >= a[l]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `r` is decremented by 1, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1 unless `k` was initially 0, in which case `sunks` remains unchanged. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no further changes are made to the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
