Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[r]`) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` was 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
