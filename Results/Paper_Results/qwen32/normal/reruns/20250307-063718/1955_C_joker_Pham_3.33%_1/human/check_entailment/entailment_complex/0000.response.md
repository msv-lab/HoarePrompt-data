### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine how many ships will sink after the Kraken attacks them `k` times, alternating between the first and last ships that haven't sunk yet. The function `func_1` is supposed to implement this logic. Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ships, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there's only one ship left. If `k` is enough to sink this ship, it is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the ship at `l` is less than or equal to that of the ship at `r`:
     - If `k` is enough to sink both ships (considering the durability of the ship at `l` twice), it reduces `k` by the doubled durability of the ship at `l`, adjusts the durability of the ship at `r`, and increments `sunks` accordingly.
     - If `k` is exactly enough to sink the ship at `l` and one attack on the ship at `r`, it sinks the ship at `l` and breaks.
     - Otherwise, it breaks because `k` is not enough to sink the ship at `l`.
   - If the durability of the ship at `r` is less than that of the ship at `l`, the same logic is applied but with the roles of `l` and `r` reversed.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates either when `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes 0.
   - The function returns the count of ships that have sunk (`sunks`).

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue with the program lies in the handling of cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink the ship at `l` and one attack on the ship at `r` (or vice versa). Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the decrementing of `l` or `r` in these cases. Here's an example to illustrate:

- Suppose `a = [2, 3]`, `k = 5`.
  - First attack: `k -= 2*2` (sinks the first ship), `a = [3]`, `sunks = 1`.
  - Second attack: `k` is now 1, which is not enough to sink the remaining ship, so the loop breaks without sinking the second ship.
  - However, the correct behavior should be to sink the remaining ship because `k` is exactly enough for one more attack.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when `k` is exactly enough to sink the ship at `l` and one attack on the ship at `r` (or vice versa). Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
