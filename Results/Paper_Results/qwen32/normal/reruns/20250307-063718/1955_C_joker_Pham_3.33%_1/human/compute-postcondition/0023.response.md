The provided code snippet contains only the `continue` statement, which does not alter the state of any variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks` are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k - a[l] * 2 <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is not equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, then `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`; `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`. If `a[r]` is 0, `sunks` is set to 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the postcondition is the same as the precondition except that `l` is not necessarily equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `l` is incremented by 1.**
