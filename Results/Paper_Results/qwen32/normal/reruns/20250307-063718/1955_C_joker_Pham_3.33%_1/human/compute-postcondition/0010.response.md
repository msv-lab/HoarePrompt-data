Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is equal to `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0.**
