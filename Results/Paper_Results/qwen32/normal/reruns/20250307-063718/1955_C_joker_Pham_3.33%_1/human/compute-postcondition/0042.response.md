The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `l` is not necessarily equal to `r`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0. The updated value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `l` is incremented by 1.**
