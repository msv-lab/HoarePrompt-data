Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[r]`) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
