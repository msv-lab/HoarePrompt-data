Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without making any changes to `sunks`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
