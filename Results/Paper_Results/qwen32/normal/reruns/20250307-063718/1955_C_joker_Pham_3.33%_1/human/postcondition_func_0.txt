The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to reduce elements in the list `a` by pairing the smallest and largest elements and subtracting their doubled values from `k` until `k` is exhausted or no more valid pairs can be formed. The function returns the total number of such operations performed.
