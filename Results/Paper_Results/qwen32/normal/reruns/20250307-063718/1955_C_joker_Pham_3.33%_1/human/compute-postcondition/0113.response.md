Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without making any changes to `sunks`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and no changes are made to `sunks`.**
