Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. The loop or if statement is broken out of without changing the state of the variables.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to terminate immediately without making any changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `sunks`, or any other variables involved in the conditions. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as the initial state.
