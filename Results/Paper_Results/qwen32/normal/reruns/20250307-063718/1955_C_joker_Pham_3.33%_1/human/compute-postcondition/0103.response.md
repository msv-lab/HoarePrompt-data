The code snippet `a[r] -= a[l]` modifies the value of the element at index `r` in the list `a` by subtracting the value of the element at index `l` from it.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a[r]`, which is now equal to its previous value minus `a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and specifically `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without making any changes to `sunks`. `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]`.**
