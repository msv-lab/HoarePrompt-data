Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and specifically `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without making any changes to `sunks`. If `a[r]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]` regardless of the value of `a[r]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
