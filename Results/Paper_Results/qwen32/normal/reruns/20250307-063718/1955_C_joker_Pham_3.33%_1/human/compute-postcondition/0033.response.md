Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, then `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. `k` is 0. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the postcondition is the same as the precondition. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `l` is not necessarily equal to `r`. `sunks` remains 0.**

In simpler terms: The postcondition is the same as the precondition with the additional information that `k` is 0. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the state remains the same as the precondition. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `l` may or may not be equal to `r`. The variable `sunks` remains 0.
