Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged and the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing the state of the variables. `r` is decreased by 1 if `k >= a[r] * 2`.**
