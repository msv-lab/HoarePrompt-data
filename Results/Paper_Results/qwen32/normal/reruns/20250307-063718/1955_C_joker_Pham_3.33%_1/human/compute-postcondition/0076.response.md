Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, then `r` is decremented by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2`, then the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing the state of the variables, unless `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, in which case `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of the values of `l` and `r`.**
