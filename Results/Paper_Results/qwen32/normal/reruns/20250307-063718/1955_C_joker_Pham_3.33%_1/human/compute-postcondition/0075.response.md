Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing the state of the variables.**
