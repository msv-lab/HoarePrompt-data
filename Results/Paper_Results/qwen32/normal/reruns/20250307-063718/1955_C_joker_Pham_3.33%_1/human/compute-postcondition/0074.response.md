Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of all variables remains as described in the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited.
