Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). The function performs a series of operations based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, and returns the total number of operations performed, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.**
