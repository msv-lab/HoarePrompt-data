The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition `l <= r` must be satisfied. Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `l` and `r` accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `l` and `r` are such that `l <= r` might not hold true anymore. To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:
1. If `l` is greater than `r`, we need to adjust `l` or `r` so that `l <= r`.
2. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop can still execute one more time.
3. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can still execute one more time.

Since we need to guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we should adjust the values of `l` and `r` such that `l <= r`. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `l` to be equal to `r` if `l` is greater than `r`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then if `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. The updated value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`. If `a[l]` is not 0, the updated value of `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the state remains unchanged. `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**

To simplify, we can say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`**
