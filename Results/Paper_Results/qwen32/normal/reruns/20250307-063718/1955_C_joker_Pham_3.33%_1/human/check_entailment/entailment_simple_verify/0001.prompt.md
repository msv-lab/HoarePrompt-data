You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The Kraken attacks ships in an alternating pattern: first the first ship, then the last ship, and continues this pattern until all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks. The goal is to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a two-pointer approach (`l` for the first ship and `r` for the last ship) to simulate the Kraken's attacks. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` is initialized to 0 (the first ship).
   - `r` is initialized to `n-1` (the last ship).
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 (to count the number of ships that have sunk).

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is sufficient to sink this ship (`k >= a[r]`), it gets sunk and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, it means the first ship is weaker or equally strong as the last ship. The Kraken attacks the first ship first:
     - If `k >= a[l] * 2`, it means the Kraken can attack the first ship fully and still have enough attacks left to attack the last ship fully. The Kraken attacks the first ship fully (`k -= a[l]`), then attacks the last ship (`k -= a[l]`, `a[r] -= a[l]`), and if the last ship's durability drops to 0, it gets sunk (`sunks += 1`, `r -= 1`). The first ship also gets sunk (`sunks += 1`, `l += 1`).
     - If `k == a[l] * 2 - 1`, it means the Kraken can attack the first ship fully and the last ship almost fully, sinking the first ship (`sunks += 1`), and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the Kraken cannot sink both ships, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, it means the last ship is weaker than the first ship. The Kraken attacks the last ship first, similar to the above logic.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is large enough to sink all ships, the loop will continue until all ships are sunk.
   - If `k` is not sufficient to sink all ships, the loop will break once `k` is exhausted.

### Issues with the Program:
The main issue with the program is the handling of the case where `k` is not sufficient to fully attack both ships, and the program incorrectly breaks the loop without properly decrementing `k` and updating the ship's durability. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `k` is between `a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1` (or similarly for `a[r]`) correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and can incorrectly break the loop without properly decrementing `k` and updating the ship's durability. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
