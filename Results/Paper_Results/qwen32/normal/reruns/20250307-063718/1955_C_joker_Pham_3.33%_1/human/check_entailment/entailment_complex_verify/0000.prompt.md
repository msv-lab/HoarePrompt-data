You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #The program returns the total number of operations performed, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to reduce elements in the list `a` by pairing the smallest and largest elements and subtracting their doubled values from `k` until `k` is exhausted or no more valid pairs can be formed. The function returns the total number of such operations performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, there are issues with the logic when the Kraken attacks the same ship multiple times, and the program does not correctly account for the number of attacks left (`k`) and the durability of the ships.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
Input:
```
1
3 4
1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1), it sinks. Durabilities: [2, 1]
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1), it sinks. Durabilities: [2]
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 2), it reduces to 1. Durabilities: [1]
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1), it sinks. Durabilities: []

In this case, all 3 ships should sink.

However, let's see what the given program does with this input:

### Program Output:
The program will likely not correctly handle the above case because it does not properly decrement the durability of the ships and does not correctly account for when the Kraken attacks the same ship multiple times.

### Debugging the code:
The main issue is in the logic of reducing the durability of the ships and checking the number of attacks left. The program does not correctly handle the case when the Kraken attacks the first and last ships multiple times until they sink.

For example, in the given code:
```python
if a[l] <= a[r]:
    if k >= a[l] * 2:
        k -= a[l] * 2
        a[r] -= a[l]
        if a[r] == 0:
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
        sunks += 1
        l += 1
        continue
    elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
        sunks += 1
        break
    else:
        break
```
The program incorrectly assumes that if `k >= a[l] * 2`, it can attack both the first and last ships once each. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken needs to attack the same ship multiple times until it sinks.

### Correct Approach:
The program should correctly decrement the durability of the ships and check if they sink after each attack. It should also correctly account for the number of attacks left (`k`).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly, especially when the Kraken attacks the same ship multiple times. Therefore, the correctness is False.
