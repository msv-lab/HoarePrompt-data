#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of operations performed, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to reduce elements in the list `a` by pairing the smallest and largest elements and subtracting their doubled values from `k` until `k` is exhausted or no more valid pairs can be formed. The function returns the total number of such operations performed.
