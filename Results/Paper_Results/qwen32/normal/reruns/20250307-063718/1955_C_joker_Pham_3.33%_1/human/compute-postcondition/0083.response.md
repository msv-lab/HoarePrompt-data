The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r` and `l` is now `l + 1`; `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`; `sunks` is increased by 1.**
