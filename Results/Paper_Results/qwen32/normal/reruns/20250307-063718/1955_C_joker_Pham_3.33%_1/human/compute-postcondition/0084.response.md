Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `l`, `k`, or `sunks`.**
