Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and specifically `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `r` and `l` is incremented by 1; `k` is `k - a[r] * 2` unless `k` was initially 0, in which case `sunks` remains unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
