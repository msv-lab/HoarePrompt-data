The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `temp` will now hold the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is 2; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is 2.**
