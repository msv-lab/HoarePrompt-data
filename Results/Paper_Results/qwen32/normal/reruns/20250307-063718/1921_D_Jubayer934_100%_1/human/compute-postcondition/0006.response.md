The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The state of `t`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` does not affect whether the loop can execute or not, so we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and set `i` to its initial value, which is 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is 0**
