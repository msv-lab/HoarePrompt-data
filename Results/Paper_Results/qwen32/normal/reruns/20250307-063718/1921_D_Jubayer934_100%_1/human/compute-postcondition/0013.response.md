The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Given that `i` is 1, `temp` will now hold the value 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is 1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is 1**.
