Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, except that `i` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
