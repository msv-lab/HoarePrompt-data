Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` through `abs(a[n - 1] - b[-(n - (n - 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `temp` has been set to -1, indicating that the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was never met during the loop. All other variables retain their previous values.
