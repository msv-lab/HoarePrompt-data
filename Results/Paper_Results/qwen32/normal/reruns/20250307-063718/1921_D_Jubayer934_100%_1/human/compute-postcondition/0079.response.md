The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not reached `n` yet, and `n` is greater than 0.

Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
