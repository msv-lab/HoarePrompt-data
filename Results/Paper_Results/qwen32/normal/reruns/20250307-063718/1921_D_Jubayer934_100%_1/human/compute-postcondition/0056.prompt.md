Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise it contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and now also contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
