Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to some `i` during the loop where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks.**
