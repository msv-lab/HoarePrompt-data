Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` through `abs(a[n - 1] - b[-(n - (n - 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `n`.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list will include the absolute differences starting from the first index `temp` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met, up to the last index `n-1`. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `n`, indicating that all iterations from `temp` to `n-1` have been completed. The other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial states.
