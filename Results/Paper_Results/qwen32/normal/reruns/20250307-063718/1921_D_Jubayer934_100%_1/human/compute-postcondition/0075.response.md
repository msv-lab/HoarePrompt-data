The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, and `b[-(n - i)]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions provided. The Output State reflects these changes and conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `temp` is `i`.**
