Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `temp` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `a[i]`, `b[-(n - i)]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged. The variable `temp` retains its value of `i`. The loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
