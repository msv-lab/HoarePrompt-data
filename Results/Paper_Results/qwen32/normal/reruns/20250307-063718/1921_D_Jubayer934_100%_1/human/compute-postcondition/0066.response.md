To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic of the program:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer greater than or equal to 1 (not directly used in the print statement but sets the context for multiple test cases).
   - `n`: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in list `a`.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input, representing the number of largest elements to take from the input to form list `b`.
   - `temp`: Either -1 or an integer less than `n`, used to determine if additional calculations need to be done.
   - `ans`: A list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all iterations up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, or all `n` iterations if the loop does not break. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
   - `a`: A list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input.
   - `b`: A list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order.
   - `i`: Either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks otherwise.

2. **Logic:**
   - The list `a` is formed by taking the first `n` integers from the input and sorting them.
   - The list `b` is formed by taking the `m` largest integers from the input and sorting them in descending order.
   - The list `ans` is populated with the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` up to `n` iterations or until the loop breaks.
   - If `temp` is not -1, additional absolute differences are calculated between elements of `a` and reversed elements of `b` starting from index `temp` to `n-1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of all the absolute differences stored in the list `ans`.

Given the information, the exact numerical value of the sum cannot be determined without the specific input values, but we can describe the output precisely based on the logic provided.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list containing the absolute differences abs(a[i] - b[i]) for all iterations up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, or all n iterations if the loop does not break. If temp is not -1, ans also includes the absolute differences abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) for each i from temp to n-1)**
