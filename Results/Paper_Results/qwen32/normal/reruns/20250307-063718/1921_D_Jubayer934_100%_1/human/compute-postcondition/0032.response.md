To determine the output of the `print(sum(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

Here's a breakdown of the key points in the initial state:

1. **Lists `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order.

2. **Variable `temp`**:
   - `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met.
   - If no such index exists, `temp` is -1.
   - `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`.

3. **List `ans`**:
   - `ans` initially contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`.
   - It then includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` through `abs(a[n - 1] - b[-(n - (n - 1))])`.
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Loop and Condition**:
   - The loop iterates up to `temp` if `temp` is not -1.
   - After `temp`, it continues to calculate differences using the mirrored index in `b`.

Given this information, let's determine what `sum(ans)` will print:

- **If `temp` is not -1**:
  - `ans` includes the absolute differences up to `temp` and then continues with the mirrored index differences from `temp + 1` to `n - 1`.
  - The sum of `ans` will be the total of these absolute differences.

- **If `temp` is -1**:
  - The loop completes all iterations, and `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - The sum of `ans` will be the total of these absolute differences.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, we can describe the value of `sum(ans)` based on the conditions given.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of absolute differences calculated as described based on the values of a and b, and the condition involving temp)**
