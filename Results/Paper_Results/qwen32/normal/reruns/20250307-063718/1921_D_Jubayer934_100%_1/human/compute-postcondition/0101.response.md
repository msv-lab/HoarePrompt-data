Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
