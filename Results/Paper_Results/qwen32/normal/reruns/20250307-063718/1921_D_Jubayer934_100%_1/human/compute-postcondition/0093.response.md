The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `temp`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks, and `temp` must be less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `temp` should be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is the value at which the loop breaks, to start the next iteration, `i` should be `temp + 1` (since `temp` is the starting point of the current iteration and `i` should be one more than the last completed iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` must be less than `n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks and now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input, `b` is the list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`**
