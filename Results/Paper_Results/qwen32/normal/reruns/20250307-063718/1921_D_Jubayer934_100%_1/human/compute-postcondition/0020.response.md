Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is 2 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
