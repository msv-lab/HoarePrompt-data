The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, but it does update the list `ans` by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
