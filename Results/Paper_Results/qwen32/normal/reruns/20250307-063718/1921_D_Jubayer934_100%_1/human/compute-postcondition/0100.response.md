Output State: **t test cases have been processed, each with its own n and m values, a list of n integers, and a list of m integers. For each test case, the loop calculates the sum of the absolute differences between elements of two lists: `a` and `b`. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `b` is sorted in descending order. The loop iterates through each element of `a` and compares the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` with the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. If the latter difference is larger, it switches to using `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements of `a`. The final output for each test case is the sum of these absolute differences.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of two lists, `a` and `b`, with a specific condition for switching the reference element in `b`. The final output for each test case is printed.
