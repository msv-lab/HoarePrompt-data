Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either `-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks, or for all `n` elements if the loop completes all iterations, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input, `b` is the list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order, `i` is either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not `-1`, `temp` must be less than `n`, `ans` now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`.**
