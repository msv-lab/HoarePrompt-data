**Reasoning:**

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by maximizing the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the elements of \( a \) and compares the absolute difference between \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) with the absolute difference between \( a[i] \) and \( b[-(n - i)] \).
   - If the latter difference is larger, it switches to using \( b[-(n - i)] \) for the remaining elements of \( a \).

4. **Switching Logic:**
   - The variable `temp` is used to track the point at which the program switches from using \( b[i] \) to \( b[-(n - i)] \).
   - If the condition \( abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]) \) is met, the program breaks out of the loop and sets `temp` to the current index \( i \).
   - After the loop, if `temp` is not -1, the program continues appending the differences using \( b[-(n - i)] \) for the remaining elements.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans`.

**Correctness:**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \). By sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order, the program ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first. The switching logic correctly identifies when to use the largest remaining element from \( b \) to maximize the difference.

Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the logic and implementation appear to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
