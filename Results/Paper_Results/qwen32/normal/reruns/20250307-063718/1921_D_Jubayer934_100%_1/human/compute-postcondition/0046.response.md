The code snippet `temp = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `temp`. This means that the value of `temp` will now be equal to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**
