The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `temp`, which is the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `temp + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `temp + 1`**
