The code assigns the current value of `i` to a new variable `temp`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `i` continues to be incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is equal to the previous value of `i`**.
