The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, the `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only alters the control flow of the program. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
