The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value in the sequence. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, we simply need to increment `i` by 1 to get the next value.

No changes are required for `n` as it remains constant throughout the loop.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
