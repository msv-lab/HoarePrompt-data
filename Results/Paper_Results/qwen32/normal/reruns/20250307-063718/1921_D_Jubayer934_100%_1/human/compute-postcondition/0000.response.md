In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `range(int(input()))` function. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted since it is automatically assigned by the `range` function.
3. The values of `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are specific to each test case and are read inside the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
