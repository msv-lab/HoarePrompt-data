Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks (not equal to -1); `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks; `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is the list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks.**
