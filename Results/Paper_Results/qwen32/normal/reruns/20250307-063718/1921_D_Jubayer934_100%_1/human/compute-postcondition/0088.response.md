The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this operation unless the condition in the initial state is met, which would break the loop or if statement. Since the condition does not directly impact this line of code, we only update `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is equal to the previous value of `i` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur. `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**
