Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is equal to some `i` during the loop where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is an integer such that `temp` is less than `n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, plus the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is the value of `i` at which the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is an integer such that `temp` is less than `i + 1`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, plus the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is an integer such that `temp` is less than `i + 1`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, plus the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. The list `ans` has been updated to include the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
