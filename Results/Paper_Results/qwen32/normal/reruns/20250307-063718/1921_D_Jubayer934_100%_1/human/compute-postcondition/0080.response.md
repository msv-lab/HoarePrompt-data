The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0. The value of `i` remains incremented by 1, as the increment operation happened before the assignment to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is equal to `i`.**
