To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `n`: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in list `a`.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input, representing the number of elements in list `b`.
   - `a`: A list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input.
   - `b`: A list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order.
   - `ans`: A list that contains the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks, or for all `n` elements if the loop completes all iterations.
   - `temp`: Either `-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not `-1`, `temp` must be less than `n`.
   - `i`: Either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not `-1`, `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the absolute differences between corresponding elements.
   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `temp` remains `-1` and `i` becomes `n`.
   - If the loop breaks at some iteration `i`, `temp` is set to that `i`, and `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` is further updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement calculates the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

Given the above, the `ans` list contains absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop breaks (or for all `n` elements if the loop completes all iterations). If the loop breaks, `ans` is further updated to include additional differences.

Since we do not have the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and the specific conditions under which the loop might break, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans contains the absolute differences between elements of a and b up to the point where the loop breaks, or for all n elements if the loop completes all iterations, and is further updated if the loop breaks)**

This description captures the essence of the `ans` list formation and the final sum calculation based on the given initial state.
