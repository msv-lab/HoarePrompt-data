Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` through `abs(a[n - 1] - b[-(n - (n - 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `n`. If `temp` is -1, then the loop completes all iterations and `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is either -1 or an integer less than `n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all iterations up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, or all `n` iterations if the loop does not break. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either `-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks, or for all `n` elements if the loop completes all iterations, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input, `b` is the list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order, `i` is either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not `-1`, `temp` must be less than `n`, `ans` now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
