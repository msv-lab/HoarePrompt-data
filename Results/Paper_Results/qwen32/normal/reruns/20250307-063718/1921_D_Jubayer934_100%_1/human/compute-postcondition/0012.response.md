To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

Given the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is an integer provided by the input.
- `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order.
- `i` is 0.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The value of `n` does not change within the loop and it is the upper limit for the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is 1**.
