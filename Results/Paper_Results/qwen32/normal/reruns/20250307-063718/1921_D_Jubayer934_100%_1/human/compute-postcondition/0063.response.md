Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is an integer such that `temp` is less than `i + 1`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, plus the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. The list `ans` has been updated to include the new element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
