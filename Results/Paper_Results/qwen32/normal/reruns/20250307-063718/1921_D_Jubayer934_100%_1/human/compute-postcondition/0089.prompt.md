Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks otherwise; the next input is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp` or the loop continues. `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes occur. `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is equal to the previous value of `i` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur. `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
