Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all iterations up to and including the iteration where the loop breaks, or all `n` iterations if the loop does not break. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the newly sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the newly provided input, in descending order; `i` is either `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value of `i` at which the loop breaks otherwise; the next input is 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `temp` has been set to -1. All other variables retain their initial values and meanings.
