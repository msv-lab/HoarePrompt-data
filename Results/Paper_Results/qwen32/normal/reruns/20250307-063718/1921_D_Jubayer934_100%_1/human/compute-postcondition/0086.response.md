The `break` statement in the provided code snippet does not modify the values of any variables; it only terminates the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there are no assignments or modifications to `n`, `i`, or `temp` in the given code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
