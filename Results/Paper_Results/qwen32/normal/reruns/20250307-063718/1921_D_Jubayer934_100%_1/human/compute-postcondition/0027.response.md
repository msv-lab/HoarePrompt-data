The code snippet appends the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `temp + 1`, and `ans` already contains the absolute differences up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `temp + 1`**.
