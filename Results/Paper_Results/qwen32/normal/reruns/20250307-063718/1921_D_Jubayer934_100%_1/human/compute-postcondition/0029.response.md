Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer provided by the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1 and `temp < n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at `temp`, and now includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` and `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the sorted input, in descending order; `i` is `temp + 3`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]`, and the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 to `temp + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
