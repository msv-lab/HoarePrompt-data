The code snippet sets `bc` to 0, which changes its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 0. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the current value of `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
