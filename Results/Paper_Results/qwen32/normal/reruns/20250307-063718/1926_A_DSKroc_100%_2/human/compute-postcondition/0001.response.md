The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `q` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. The state of `t` and `q` are the only ones we can adjust, and `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0**
