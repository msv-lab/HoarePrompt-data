The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. To ensure the loop executes, the string `s` must have at least one character. The variables `t`, `q`, `ac`, and `bc` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control whether the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `s` must be a non-empty string. The initial state of `i` does not need to be specified as it is automatically assigned by the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string**
