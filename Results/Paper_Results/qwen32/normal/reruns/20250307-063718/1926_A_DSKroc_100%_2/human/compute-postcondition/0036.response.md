Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1, and `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If `i` was 'A', `ac` was originally 1 and is now 2. If `i` was not 'A', `ac` was originally 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
