The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, and the current character `i` is 'A'.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, and the current character `i` is 'A'.**
