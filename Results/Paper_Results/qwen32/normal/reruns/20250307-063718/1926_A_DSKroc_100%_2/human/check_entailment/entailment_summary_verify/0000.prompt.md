You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters in the string is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string is equal. In such a scenario, the program will always output 'B', which is incorrect as the problem description does not specify a tie-breaking rule, but it implies that the most frequent letter should be chosen. If the counts are equal, the program should handle this edge case appropriately, for example, by choosing either 'A' or 'B' consistently, or by some other rule if specified.

To fix this, you could modify the comparison to handle ties by choosing one of the letters consistently, for example:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or 'B', depending on how you want to handle ties
```

In this corrected version, if `ac` equals `bc`, the program will consistently print 'A'. You can choose 'B' instead if you prefer. However, the original code does not handle this tie case correctly, hence it is incorrect.
