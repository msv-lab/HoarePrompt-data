The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the value of the variable `ac` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `ac` is increased by 1**.
