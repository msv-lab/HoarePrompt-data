Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters in the string is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'.**
