Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `s` is the string input by the user, `ac` is the count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the current value of `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
