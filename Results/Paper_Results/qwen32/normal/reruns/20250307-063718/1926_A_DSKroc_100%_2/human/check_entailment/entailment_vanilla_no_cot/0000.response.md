Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct in terms of logic, but it does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem statement, if the counts are equal, either 'A' or 'B' can be printed, but the program will always print 'B' in this scenario. However, based on typical problem constraints and the given examples, it seems that the program's behavior is acceptable. 

If we strictly follow the problem statement and assume that it's valid for the program to output either 'A' or 'B' when the counts are equal, then the program is correct. But if the problem expects a specific output in the case of a tie (which is not specified), then the program might be incorrect.

Given the examples provided, the program seems to work as expected, so:

Correctness: **True**
