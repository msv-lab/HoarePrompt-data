You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters in the string is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. This is done using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, where each iteration corresponds to a single test case.

3. **Counting Characters**: Inside the loop, for each test case, it initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, respectively.

4. **Processing Each String**: For each string `s` of length 5, it iterates through each character `i` in the string. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac` by 1. If the character is 'B', it increments `bc` by 1.

5. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', it compares the two counters. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the most frequent character for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic is correct because it accurately counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and then correctly determines which character appears more frequently.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible strings of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. Since the input constraints guarantee that each string is of length 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B', there are no edge cases that would cause the program to fail.
- **Distinct Strings**: The problem states that all `t` strings are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program as it processes each string independently.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input as specified, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' accurately, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
