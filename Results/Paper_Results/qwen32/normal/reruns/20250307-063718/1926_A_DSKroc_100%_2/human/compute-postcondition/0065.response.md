The code snippet `bc += 1` increments the variable `bc` by 1. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `bc` is incremented by 1.**
