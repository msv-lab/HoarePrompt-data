The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each of those strings into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `r`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, but none of these are directly affected by the provided code snippet. The only variable that changes is `r`, which is assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9. `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`. It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `r` is a list of integers read from the input.**
