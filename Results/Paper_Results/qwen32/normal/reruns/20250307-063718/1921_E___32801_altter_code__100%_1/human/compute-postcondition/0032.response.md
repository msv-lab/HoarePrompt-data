Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the key point to note is that the `print` statement is very straightforward:

```python
print('draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'draw'`, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `a`, `b`, and `t` (absolute difference).

Since the `print` statement is static and does not depend on any of the variables or their values, the output will be exactly the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
