Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `x2` is adjusted by subtracting `a` from it. Let's determine the new value of `x2` and ensure the other variables remain consistent with their initial state descriptions.

From the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9.
- `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`.
- It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`.
- The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`.
- `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`.
- `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1`.
- If `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

The code snippet modifies `x2` by subtracting `a` from it:
```
x2 -= a
```

After this operation, the new value of `x2` is `x2 - a`.
