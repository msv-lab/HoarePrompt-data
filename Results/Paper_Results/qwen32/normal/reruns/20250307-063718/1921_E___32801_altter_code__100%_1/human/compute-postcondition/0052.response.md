The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and their properties, such as `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`, `y2`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('bob')`, which directly outputs the string `'bob'`.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'bob'`.

Output: **bob**
