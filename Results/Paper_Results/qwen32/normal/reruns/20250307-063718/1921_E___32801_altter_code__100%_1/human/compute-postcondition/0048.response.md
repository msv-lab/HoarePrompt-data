Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement executes.

### Analysis of the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case:
  - `h` and `w` are integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 10^9\).
  - `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_a, x_b \leq h\) and \(1 \leq y_a, y_b \leq w\).
  - It is guaranteed that either \(x_a \neq x_b\) or \(y_a \neq y_b\).
  - The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).
  - `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
  - `n` is `r[0]`.
  - `m` is `r[1]`.
  - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
  - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
  - `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`.
  - `a` is `m - y2`.
  - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
  - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
  - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is at most `n`.
  - If `y2` <= `y1`, then `y2` is 1, `y1` is `r[3] - m`, and `c` is `y1 - 1` which is `r[3] - m - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1 + (m - y2)` if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1 + (m - y2)`, `y1` is greater than `y2`, `y2` is `m`, and `c` is `m - y1`.
  - Either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Determining the Output:
The print statement `print('draw')` is straightforward. It prints the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables defined in the initial state. The initial state describes the context and constraints in which the variables operate but does not affect the literal string `'draw'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
