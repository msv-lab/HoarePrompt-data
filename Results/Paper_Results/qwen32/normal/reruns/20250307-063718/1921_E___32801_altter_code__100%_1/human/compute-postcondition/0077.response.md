Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1` is greater than `y2`, otherwise `t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`. `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9. `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`. It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`. If `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, `y1` is set to 1, `y2` is adjusted to `y2 - a` where `a` is `y1 - 1`, and `c` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is greater than `y2`, `y1` is set to `m`, `y2` remains the same, `a` is `y1 - 1`, and `c` is `r[1] - y2`. `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`. Additionally, `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, and `1 <= x1 <= n`.**

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the additional conditions specified in the if statement.
