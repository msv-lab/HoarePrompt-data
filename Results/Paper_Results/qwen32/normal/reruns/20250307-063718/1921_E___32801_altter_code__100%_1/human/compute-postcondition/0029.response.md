Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; it is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`. `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1`. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `x1` has been updated by adding `a` to it. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
