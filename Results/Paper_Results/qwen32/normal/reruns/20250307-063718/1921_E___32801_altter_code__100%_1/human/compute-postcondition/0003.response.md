The `print('draw')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'draw'` is directly passed to the `print` function.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
