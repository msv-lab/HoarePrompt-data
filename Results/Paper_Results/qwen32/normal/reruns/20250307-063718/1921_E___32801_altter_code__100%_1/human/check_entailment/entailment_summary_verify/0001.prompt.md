You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input values representing dimensions and coordinates, and prints either 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw' based on the conditions related to these values. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers representing the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `x_b <= x_a`, the program outputs "draw". This is because Bob cannot move up if he is already in or above Alice's row.
   - If `(x_b - x_a) % 2 != 0`, it means the number of rows between Alice and Bob is odd. In this case, Alice can potentially win if she can move to the same column as Bob in her first move. If Bob is not in the same column, Alice moves diagonally towards Bob and checks if she can reach the same column in the next move. If she can, she wins.

3. **Even Row Difference Case**:
   - If `(x_b - x_a) % 2 == 0`, it means the number of rows between Alice and Bob is even. In this case, Bob can potentially win if he can move to the same column as Alice in his first move. If Alice is not in the same column, Bob moves diagonally towards Alice and checks if he can reach the same column in the next move. If he can, he wins.

4. **Further Moves**:
   - The program then calculates the number of moves Alice and Bob can make to reach the same column and checks if either can force a win by reaching the same column with the right conditions.

5. **Draw Condition**:
   - If neither player can force a win, the game ends in a draw. This is checked by ensuring that neither player can move to the same column or that the conditions for winning are not met.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the winner when the number of rows between Alice and Bob is even or odd is not entirely correct. The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob can force a win by moving diagonally and then reaching the same column.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where Alice or Bob can force a win by moving to the same column in a way that prevents the opponent from making a move.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
