Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for every potential case. Let's analyze some cases where the code fails:

1. **Case 1: Alice can win in the next move**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3 3 1 1 2 2
   Expected Output: Alice
   Actual Output: Draw
   ```
   Explanation: Alice can move to (2, 2) and win immediately.

2. **Case 2: Bob can win in the next move**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3 3 2 2 3 3
   Expected Output: Bob
   Actual Output: Draw
   ```
   Explanation: Bob can move to (2, 2) and win immediately.

3. **Case 3: Alice wins by forcing Bob into a corner**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   4 4 1 1 4 4
   Expected Output: Alice
   Actual Output: Draw
   ```
   Explanation: Alice can force Bob into a corner where he cannot move, and then Alice wins.

The code seems to have incorrect logic for determining the winner and does not correctly handle all edge cases. It incorrectly assumes certain conditions and does not properly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
