Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; it is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`. If `y2` > `y1`, then `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1`; otherwise, `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1`. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.**
