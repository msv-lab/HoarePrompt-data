The code snippet `y2 = m` updates the value of `y2` to be equal to `m`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Given the initial state, all other values remain as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; it is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`; `x2` is `r[4] - a`; `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y1` is greater than `y2`; `a` is `m - y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is at most `n`; `y2` is `m`.**
