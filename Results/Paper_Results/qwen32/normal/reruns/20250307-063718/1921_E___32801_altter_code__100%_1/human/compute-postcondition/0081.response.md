To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is defined based on the condition `y1 > y2`. If `y1 > y2`, then `t = abs(y2 - y1)`. Otherwise, `t = abs(y2 - 1)`.
   - `h` and `w` are integers within specific ranges.
   - `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers also within specific ranges.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from the input, with `n = r[0]` and `m = r[1]`.
   - If `y1 <= y2`, then:
     - `y1` is set to 1.
     - `y2` is adjusted to `y2 - a` where `a = y1 - 1`.
     - `c` is `y2 - 1`.
   - If `y1 > y2`, then:
     - `y1` is set to `m`.
     - `y2` remains the same.
     - `a` is `y1 - 1`.
     - `c` is `r[1] - y2`.
   - `x2` is calculated as `r[4] - a`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - There are additional conditions regarding `x2`, `x1`, `b`, `a`, and `c`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

### Output Determination:
Given the initial state, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x2`, `b`, `a`, or `c`. The string `'draw'` is hardcoded in the `print` statement and will be output regardless of the values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
