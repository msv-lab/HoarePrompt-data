The value of `y1` is explicitly set to 1. This change affects the value of `t` because `t` is defined as `abs(y2 - y1)`. Since `y1` is now 1, `t` will be `abs(y2 - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`; `a` is `y1 - 1` since `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`**
