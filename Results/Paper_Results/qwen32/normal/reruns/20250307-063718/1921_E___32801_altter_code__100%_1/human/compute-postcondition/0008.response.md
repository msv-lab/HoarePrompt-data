The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the initial state or other variables defined in the problem description. Therefore, the output will be the literal string 'Alice'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not reference any variables from the initial state.
2. The string 'Alice' is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. No calculations or conditions are applied to modify the string 'Alice'.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
