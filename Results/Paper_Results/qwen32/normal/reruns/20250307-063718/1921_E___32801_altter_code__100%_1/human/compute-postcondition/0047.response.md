Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; it is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`; `x2` is `r[4] - a`; `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `a` is `m - y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is at most `n`. If `y2` <= `y1`, then `y2` is 1, `y1` is `r[3] - m`, and `c` is `y1 - 1` which is `r[3] - m - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1 + (m - y2)` if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1 + (m - y2)`, `y1` is greater than `y2`, `y2` is `m`, and `c` is `m - y1`. Either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`**
