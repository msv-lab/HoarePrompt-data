### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it meets the problem description.

1. **Initialization (func_1)**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the field (N and M).
   - It initializes the grid and a dictionary `elements` to keep track of the positions of entities.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `allPlayers` to track which players are carrying the Quaffle.
   - It identifies goals and stores their positions in the `goal` list.
   - It initializes the scores for the red and blue teams in the `points` list.

2. **Processing Commands (func_1)**:
   - The function reads the number of steps (T) and processes each command.
   - For each command, it updates the positions of players and the Quaffle, and checks for goal scoring.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle (`T` command) and the Quaffle is in a goal, it updates the score and prints the goal event.
   - If a player catches the Quaffle (`C` command), it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - For movement commands (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the position of the entity.

3. **Goal Checking (goalIn)**:
   - The function `goalIn` checks if a given position is a goal and returns the team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) or -1 if it is not a goal.

4. **Player Checking (isPlayer)**:
   - The function `isPlayer` checks if a given entity is a player by verifying the format of the entity string.

### Verification:
- The program correctly initializes the game state and processes each command.
- It handles player movement, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.
- It correctly identifies goals and updates the scores accordingly.
- The output matches the problem description, printing the correct goal events and the final score.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the problem description and handles all the specified cases.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
