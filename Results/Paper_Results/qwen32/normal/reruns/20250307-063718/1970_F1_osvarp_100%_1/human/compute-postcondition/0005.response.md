Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the grid (n lines and m columns), where 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is `[[], []]`; `points` is `[0, 0]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `points` has been updated to `[0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal`.
