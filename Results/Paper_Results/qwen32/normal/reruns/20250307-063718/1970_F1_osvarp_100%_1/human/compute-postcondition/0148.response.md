To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

The print statement provided is:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```
This statement uses the `%` operator for string formatting, where `%d` will be replaced by the integer value of `time`, and `%s` will be replaced by the string value of `GoalName[team]`.

Let's break down the variables involved:
1. **time**: This variable is explicitly mentioned in the initial state as `t`, which is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, `time` will be the value of `t`.

2. **team**: This variable is determined based on the first character of `obj`. Specifically, `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' (indicating that `obj` is a player from team B), and 0 otherwise (indicating that `obj` is a player from team A).

3. **GoalName**: This is a dictionary that maps team indices to goal names. Since the exact contents of `GoalName` are not provided in the initial state, we can denote the value of `GoalName[team]` as `GoalName[team]`.

Given the above information, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:
- `time` will be the value of the variable `t`.
- `GoalName[team]` will depend on the value of `team`, which in turn depends on the first character of `obj`.

Since the exact value of `t` and the contents of `GoalName` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **t GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where t is the value of the variable t and GoalName[team] is the goal name corresponding to the team determined by the first character of obj)**
