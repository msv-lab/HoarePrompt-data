The value of `tmp` is determined based on the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`. Given that `ind` is 2, `tmp` will be 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise, it will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `elements[line[2]]` is `(0, 2)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
