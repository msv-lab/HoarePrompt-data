The code snippet assigns a value to `tmp` based on the first character of `line[ind]`. Given that `ind` is 3, we need to check the first character of `line[3]`. The tuple `elements[line[3]]` is given as `(1, 3)`, but this information is not directly relevant to determining the value of `tmp`. The value of `tmp` will be `0` if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', otherwise it will be `1`.

Since the specific value of `line[3]` is not provided, we cannot definitively state whether `tmp` will be `0` or `1`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 3, `elements[line[3]]` is (1, 3), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
