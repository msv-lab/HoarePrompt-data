Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' then `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), including the new entry `line[ind]: (2, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player element, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, including the new entry `line[ind]: False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `line[ind]` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or to `goal[1]` if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', and `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..', no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.**
