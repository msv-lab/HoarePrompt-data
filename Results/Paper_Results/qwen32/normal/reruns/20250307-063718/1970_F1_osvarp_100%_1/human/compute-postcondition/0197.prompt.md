You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (n lines and m columns), where 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, with each string being either '..' for an empty cell, 'R0', ..., 'R9', 'B0', ..., 'B9' for players, 'RG' or 'BG' for goals, or '.Q' for the Quaffle. elements is a dictionary mapping each entity on the grid to its position as a tuple of integers (row, column). allPlayers is a dictionary mapping each player to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where goal[0] contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and goal[1] contains tuples representing the positions of red goals. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())

    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}

    #State: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, m is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, grid is a list containing n elements, all of which are line, points is [0, 0], i is n-1, line is a list of strings obtained from the input line, ind is len(line), elements is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), allPlayers is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, goal is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.

    #State: `points` is the final scores of the two teams, `elements` is the final positions of all elements, `allPlayers` indicates which players have been caught.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the score of the first team and points[1] is the score of the second team)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters representing the dimensions of a grid (n and m), the grid itself (a 2D list of strings), a dictionary mapping entities to their positions (elements), a dictionary indicating which players are carrying the Quaffle (allPlayers), a list of goal positions for both blue and red teams (goal), and a list representing the scores of the blue and red teams (points). The function returns the updated state of the game, which includes the updated positions of entities, the updated status of which players are carrying the Quaffle, and the updated scores of the blue and red teams based on the game's rules.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
