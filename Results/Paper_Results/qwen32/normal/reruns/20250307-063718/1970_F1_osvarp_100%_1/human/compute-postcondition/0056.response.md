Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 2, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind) and now includes `line[2]` with the value (1, 2) if `line[2]` was not '..', `allPlayers[line[2]]` is False if `line[2]` was a player element, `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `(1, 2)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[2][0] == 'B'` else appended to `goal[1]` if `line[2]` was not a player element and its second character is 'G'. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`. If `line[2]` was '..', no changes occur to any of the variables.**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is updated based on the first character of `line[2]`. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` becomes 0; otherwise, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
