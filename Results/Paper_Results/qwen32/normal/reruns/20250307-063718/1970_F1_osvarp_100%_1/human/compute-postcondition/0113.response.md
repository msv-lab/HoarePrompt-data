Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [10, 0] if `team` is 1 else [0, 10], `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `comand` is 3, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`, and `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0] == 'B' else 0`**

Natural Language Explanation: The `points` list has been updated. If `team` is 1 (meaning `obj[0]` is 'B'), then the first element of `points` is increased by 10, making `points` equal to [10, 0]. If `team` is 0 (meaning `obj[0]` is not 'B'), then the second element of `points` is increased by 10, making `points` equal to [0, 10]. All other variables remain unchanged.
