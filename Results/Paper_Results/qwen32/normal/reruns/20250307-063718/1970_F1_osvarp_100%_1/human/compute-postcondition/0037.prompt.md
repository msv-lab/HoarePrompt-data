Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is `[[], []]`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[0]: (0, 0)}`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, and `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', then `elements` is updated to include `line[ind]: (0, 0)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers` is `{line[ind]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is updated to either `[[(), ()], []]` or `[[], [(), ()]]` depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' (setting `tmp` to 0) or not (setting `tmp` to 1). If `line[ind]` is equal to '..', no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, `elements` is updated to include `line[1]: (0, 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element `(0, 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `line[ind]` is equal to `'..'`, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', `elements[line[2]]` is `(0, 2)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[2][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal` is either `[(0, 2), []]` if `line[2][0]` is 'B', or `[[], (0, 2)]` if `line[2][0]` is not 'B'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
