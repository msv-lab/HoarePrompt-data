Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[0]: (0, 0)}`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, and `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', then `elements` is updated to include `line[ind]: (0, 0)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers` is `{line[ind]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is updated to either `[[(), ()], []]` or `[[], [(), ()]]` depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' (setting `tmp` to 0) or not (setting `tmp` to 1). If `line[ind]` is equal to '..', no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`.**
