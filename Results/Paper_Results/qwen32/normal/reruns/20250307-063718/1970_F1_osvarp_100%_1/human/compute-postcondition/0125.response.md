Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is 'T', `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and either `obj` is not '.B' or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and either `isPlayer(obj)` is False or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.**
