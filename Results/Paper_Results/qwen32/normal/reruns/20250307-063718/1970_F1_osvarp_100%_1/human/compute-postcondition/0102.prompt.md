Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the grid (n lines and m columns), where 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is `[[], []]`; `points` is `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, m is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, grid is a list containing one element which is line, points is [0, 0], i is 0, line is a list of strings obtained from the input line. elements is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from line with their coordinates (i, ind). allPlayers is a dictionary containing all player elements from line with a value of False. goal is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
