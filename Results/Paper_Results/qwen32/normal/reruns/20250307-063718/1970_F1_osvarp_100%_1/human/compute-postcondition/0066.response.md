Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 3, `elements[line[3]]` is (1, 3). If the second character of `line[3]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is [(1, 3)]. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp` or `goal`.**
