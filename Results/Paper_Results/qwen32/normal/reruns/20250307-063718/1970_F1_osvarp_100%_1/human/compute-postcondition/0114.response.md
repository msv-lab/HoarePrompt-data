To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` and `m` are both odd integers between 3 and 99.
   - `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`.
   - `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1, otherwise `[0, 10]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings obtained from an input line.
   - `ind` is `len(line)`.
   - `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates `(i, ind)`.
   - `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of `False`.
   - `goal` is a list of two lists: 
     - The first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character.
     - The second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `comand` is a list of strings obtained from an input line, and its length is 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `comand`.
   - `com` is the second element of `comand`.
   - `el` is the third element of `comand` and is equal to '.S'.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0] == 'B'`, otherwise 0.

2. **Identifying `time` and `GoalName`:**
   - The `print` statement uses `time` and `GoalName[team]`.
   - `time` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely a variable that holds the current time or a time-related value.
   - `GoalName` is also not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we can infer that `GoalName` is a list (or dictionary) where the index (or key) corresponds to the `team` value, and it holds the name of the goal associated with that team.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The output will be a formatted string that includes the value of `time` and the value of `GoalName[team]`.
   - Since `team` is either 0 or 1, the output will depend on the value of `team` and the corresponding `GoalName[team]`.

### Conclusion
Given the information, the output will be a formatted string that includes the value of `time` and the name of the goal associated with the `team` (which is either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`).

Output: **time GoalName[team] (where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team)**
