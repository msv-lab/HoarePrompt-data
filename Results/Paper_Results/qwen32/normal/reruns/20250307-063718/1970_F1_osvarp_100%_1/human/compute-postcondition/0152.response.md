The code snippet `pos = elements[obj]` assigns the value from the dictionary `elements` associated with the key `obj` to the variable `pos`. The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `t`, `comand`, and `com` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`.**
