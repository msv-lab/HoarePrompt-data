Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string, `ind` is 4, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), including the updated entry `line[4]` with the value `(2, 4)` if `line[4]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, and if `line[4]` is a player, `allPlayers` is updated to include `line[4]` with a value of False. If `line[4][1]` is 'G', the element `(2, 4)` is added to `goal[0]` if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is added to `goal[1]`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[4][1]` is not 'G', `goal` and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
