Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[0]: (0, 0)}`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, and the current element of `line` at index `ind` is not equal to '..'. The element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player. Additionally, if the second character of the string at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `goal` is either `[[(), ()], []]` or `[[], [(), ()]]` depending on the value of `tmp`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
