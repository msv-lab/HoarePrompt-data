Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `elements[line[2]]` is `(0, 2)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[2][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal` is either `[(0, 2), []]` if `line[2][0]` is 'B', or `[[], (0, 2)]` if `line[2][0]` is not 'B'.**
