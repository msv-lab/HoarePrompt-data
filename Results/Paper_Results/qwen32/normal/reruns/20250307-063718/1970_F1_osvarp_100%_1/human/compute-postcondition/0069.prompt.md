Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind) and now includes `line[ind]` with the value (1, ind). If `line[ind]` is a player element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and its second character is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `(1, ind)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else appended to `goal[1]`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`. If `line[ind]` is '..', no changes occur to any of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 2. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind) and includes `line[2]` with the value (1, 2). If `line[2]` is a player element, `allPlayers[line[2]]` is False. If `line[2]` is not a player element and `line[2][1] == 'G'`, then `(1, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0] == 'B'` else 1. If `line[2]` is '..', no changes occur to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 3. If `line[3]` is not '..', then `elements[line[3]]` is (1, 3). If `line[3]` is a player element, `allPlayers[line[3]]` is False. If `line[3]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[3]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is [(1, 3)]. No other changes occur to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal` if `line[3]` is '..'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
