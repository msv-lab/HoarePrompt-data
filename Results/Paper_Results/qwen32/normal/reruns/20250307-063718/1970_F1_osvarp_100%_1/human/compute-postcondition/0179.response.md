Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `time` is `t + 1`, `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` from `elements`, `nxt` is the new coordinates calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `m`, `grid`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `elements`, `goal`, `t`, `comand`, `obj`, `com`, and `time` remain unchanged. A new variable `nxt` is introduced, which holds the new coordinates calculated by adding the movement values from the `mov` dictionary corresponding to the command `com` to the current position `pos`.
