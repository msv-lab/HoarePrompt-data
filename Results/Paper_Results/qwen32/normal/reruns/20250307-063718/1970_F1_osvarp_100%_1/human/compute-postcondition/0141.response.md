Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`. If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` is the third element of `comand`, `points` is [0, 0] if `el` is not equal to '.Q' and not equal to '.S', `points` is [10, 0] if `team` is 1 and `el` is '.S', `points` is [0, 10] if `team` is 0 and `el` is '.S', `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False except for `obj` which is True if `el` is '.Q'. Otherwise, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or if `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`, then `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not equal to -1, `points` is [0, 1] if `team` was 1, or `points` is [1, 0] if `team` was 0, where `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `points` remains [0, 0]. If `obj` is not '.B' and `obj` is a player element, `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. In all cases, `allPlayers[obj]` is False if `obj` is a player element, and `com` not being 'T' ensures that either `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.**
