The code snippet calculates the new position `nxt` by adding the movement vector `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. The movement vector `mov[com]` is determined by the command `com`.

Given:
- `pos` is the current position, which is a tuple `(pos[0], pos[1])` from the `elements[obj]` dictionary.
- `mov[com]` is a tuple representing the change in position based on the command `com`.

The new position `nxt` is calculated as:
- `nxt[0] = pos[0] + mov[com][0]`
- `nxt[1] = pos[1] + mov[com][1]`

The output state includes the newly calculated `nxt` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`**.
