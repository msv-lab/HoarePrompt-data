### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they correctly implement the described problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the grid itself, and the initial positions of all entities. This part seems correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - **Processing Commands**: It processes each command to move entities, catch the Quaffle, and throw it. It also checks if a goal has been scored and updates the score accordingly. It handles the movement of entities and the Quaffle correctly, and it resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - **Output**: It prints the events (goals scored) and the final score, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `goalIn`**:
   - **Checking Goal Positions**: It checks if a given position is in the list of red goals or blue goals. This function is correctly implemented to return `0` for red goals, `1` for blue goals, and `-1` if the position is not a goal.

3. **Function `isPlayer`**:
   - **Identifying Players**: It checks if a given entity is a player by verifying that the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. This function is correctly implemented.

### Issues Identified:
- **Error in `func_1`**: There is a syntax error in the line:
  ```python
  elif obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
  ```
  This line is incomplete and should be fixed. It seems like it was intended to check if a player is eliminated, but it's not correctly written. This could lead to incorrect behavior.
- **Incorrect Handling of Elimination**: The logic for player elimination is not correctly implemented. The current code does not handle the elimination of players correctly and might lead to incorrect outputs. The condition for elimination should be properly checked and the player should be removed from the game if necessary.
- **Quaffle Reset**: The code correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. It should print the other team's goal in that case.

### Corrected Code Snippet for `func_1`:
```python
elif obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj):
    player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
    print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
    # Handle elimination of player (remove from game, etc.)
elif com == 'T':
    allPlayers[obj] = False
    if goalIn(pos) != -1:
        team = goalIn(pos)
        if team == 0 and obj[0] == 'B' or team == 1 and obj[0] == 'R':
            print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
            points[team] += 1
        else:
            print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[1 - team]))
            points[1 - team] += 1
elif isPlayer(obj):
    elements[obj] = nxt
if obj == '.B':
    elements[obj] = nxt
```

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, especially the syntax error and incorrect handling of player elimination and own-goal scoring, the program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: False**
