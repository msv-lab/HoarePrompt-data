The code snippet appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at the index `tmp` of the `goal` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2. The value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[2]`. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. 

Since the exact value of `line[2]` is not provided, we consider both possibilities:
1. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0, and `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[0]`.
2. If `line[2][0]` is not 'B', then `tmp` is 1, and `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[1]`.

However, the initial state does not specify the initial contents of `goal`, so we assume `goal` is a list with at least two sublists (i.e., `goal = [[], []]`).

Given the above, the output state will be:
- If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `goal` becomes `[(0, 2), []]`.
- If `line[2][0]` is not 'B', `goal` becomes `[[], (0, 2)]`.

Since the exact value of `line[2]` is not provided, we cannot definitively state which of the two scenarios occurs. However, we can describe the output state in a way that encompasses both possibilities.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `elements[line[2]]` is `(0, 2)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal` is either `[(0, 2), []]` if `line[2][0]` is 'B', or `[[], (0, 2)]` if `line[2][0]` is not 'B'.**
