Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`. If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. If `el` is '.S', `points` is updated to [10, 0] if `team` is 1, or [0, 10] if `team` is 0. If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S', `points` remains [0, 0]. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is True. Otherwise, if the length of `comand` is not 3, `allPlayers` remains a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False. In both cases, if `obj` is equal to '.B', the value of `obj` in `elements` is updated to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `pos` is the value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is not '.B' and `obj` is a player element, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is -1, `points` remains unchanged. `time` is `t`.**
