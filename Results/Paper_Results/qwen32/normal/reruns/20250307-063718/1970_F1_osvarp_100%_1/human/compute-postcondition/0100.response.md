Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string, `ind` is 4, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind). If `line[4]` is not '..', `elements` includes the updated entry `line[4]` with the value `(2, 4)`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False. If `line[4]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[4]]` is False. If `line[4][1]` is 'G', the element `(2, 4)` is added to `goal[0]` if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is added to `goal[1]`. `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B' and `line[4][1]` is 'G', set to 1 if `line[4][0]` is not 'B' and `line[4][1]` is 'G', and remains unchanged otherwise. If `line[4]` is not a player and `line[4][1]` is not 'G', `goal` and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
