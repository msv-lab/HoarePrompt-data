To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the provided initial state.

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions**:
   - `time`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We will assume it has been defined elsewhere in the code and represents a time value.
   - `GoalName`: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their names. The exact contents of this dictionary are not provided, but it is used to look up the name of the team identified by `team`.
   - `team`: This variable is the return value of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Given the precondition, `goalIn(pos)` is not equal to -1, so `team` is a valid team identifier.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `time`.
   - `%s` is a placeholder for a string, which will be replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

3. **Output Construction**:
   - The output will be a string that combines the integer value of `time`, the string value of `GoalName[team]`, and the string "GOAL".

Given the information, the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[team]` are not provided, so we will represent them in the output as placeholders.

Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [time] is the value of time and [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team identified by team)**

This description captures the precise output based on the provided initial state and the structure of the print statement.
