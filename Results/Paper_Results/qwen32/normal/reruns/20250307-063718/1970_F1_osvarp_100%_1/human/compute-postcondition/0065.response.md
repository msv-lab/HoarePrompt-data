The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1 based on the first character of `line[3]`. Since `i` is 1 and `ind` is 3, the tuple `(1, 3)` will be appended to `goal[tmp]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 3, `elements[line[3]]` is (1, 3), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` is [(1, 3)]**.
