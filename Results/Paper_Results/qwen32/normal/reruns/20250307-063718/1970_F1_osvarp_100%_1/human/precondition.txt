N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented by an N x M grid where each cell contains either ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), or ".Q" (Quaffle). P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10, representing the number of players in each team. T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, which can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), catch a ball (C), or throw the Quaffle (T).
