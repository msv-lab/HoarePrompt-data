The only variable in the loop head is `ind`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ind` and the length of `line`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be incremented by 1, making `ind` equal to 2, and `line` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2**
