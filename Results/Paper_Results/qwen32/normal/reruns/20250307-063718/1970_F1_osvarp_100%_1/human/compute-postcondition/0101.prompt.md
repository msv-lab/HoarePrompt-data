Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' then `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), including the new entry `line[ind]: (2, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player element, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, including the new entry `line[ind]: False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `line[ind]` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or to `goal[1]` if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', and `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..', no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string, `ind` is 3, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind), including the updated entry `line[3]` with the value `(2, 3)` if `line[3]` is not '..'. `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, and if `line[3]` is a player, `allPlayers` is updated to include `line[3]` with a value of False. `goal` is a list of two lists, and if `line[3]` is not a player and `line[3][1]` is 'G', the element `(2, 3)` is added to `goal[0]` if `line[3][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is added to `goal[1]`. `tmp` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions described, set to 0 if `line[3][0]` is 'B' and `line[3][1]` is 'G', set to 1 if `line[3][0]` is not 'B' and `line[3][1]` is 'G', and remains unchanged otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string, `ind` is 4, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind). If `line[4]` is not '..', `elements` includes the updated entry `line[4]` with the value `(2, 4)`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False. If `line[4]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[4]]` is False. If `line[4][1]` is 'G', the element `(2, 4)` is added to `goal[0]` if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is added to `goal[1]`. `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B' and `line[4][1]` is 'G', set to 1 if `line[4][0]` is not 'B' and `line[4][1]` is 'G', and remains unchanged otherwise. If `line[4]` is not a player and `line[4][1]` is not 'G', `goal` and `tmp` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
