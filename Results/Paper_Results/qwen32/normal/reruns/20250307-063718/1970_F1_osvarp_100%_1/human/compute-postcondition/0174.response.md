To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the values and relationships of the variables involved.

### Analysis of Variables:
1. **`time`**: This is defined as `t + 1`. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` will be an integer greater than 1.
2. **`GoalName[team]`**: This depends on the value of `team`, which is determined by the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. The value of `GoalName[team]` is not explicitly given, but it is assumed to be a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are defined strings.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`time`**: Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` will be `t + 1`, which is also an integer greater than 1.
2. **`GoalName[team]`**: This depends on the value of `team`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1, and the print statement will use `GoalName[1]`. If `obj[0]` is not 'B', `team` is 0, and the print statement will use `GoalName[0]`.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
- `time`: An integer greater than 1.
- `GoalName[team]`: A string that depends on whether `obj[0]` is 'B' or not.

Since the exact values of `t` and `obj[0]` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [time] is t + 1 and [GoalName[team]] is the string corresponding to the team determined by the first character of obj)**
