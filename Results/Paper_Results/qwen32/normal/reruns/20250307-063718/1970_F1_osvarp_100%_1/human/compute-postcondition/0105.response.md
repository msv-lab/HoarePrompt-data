The code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to the variable `comand`. 

Given this, the value of `comand` will be a list of strings derived from the input. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `points`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `t`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.**
