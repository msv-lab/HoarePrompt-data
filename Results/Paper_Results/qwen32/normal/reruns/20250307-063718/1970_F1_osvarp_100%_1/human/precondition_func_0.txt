n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (n lines and m columns), where 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, with each string being either '..' for an empty cell, 'R0', ..., 'R9', 'B0', ..., 'B9' for players, 'RG' or 'BG' for goals, or '.Q' for the Quaffle. elements is a dictionary mapping each entity on the grid to its position as a tuple of integers (row, column). allPlayers is a dictionary mapping each player to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where goal[0] contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and goal[1] contains tuples representing the positions of red goals. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.
