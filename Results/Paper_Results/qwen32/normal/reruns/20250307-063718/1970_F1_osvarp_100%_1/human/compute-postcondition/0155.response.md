To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Variables and Their Values:

1. **`n` and `m`**: Both are odd integers between 3 and 99.
2. **`grid`**: A list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`. This implies that `grid` is a list of lists, where each inner list is `line`.
3. **`i`**: This is set to `n-1`, which means it is the index of the last element in `grid`.
4. **`line`**: A list of strings obtained from the input line. Each `line` is a part of `grid`.
5. **`ind`**: This is set to `len(line)`, which means it represents the length of a `line`.
6. **`elements`**: A dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all `lines` with their coordinates `(i, ind)`.
7. **`allPlayers`**: A dictionary containing all player elements from all `lines` with a value of `False`.
8. **`goal`**: A list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character.
9. **`t`**: An integer greater than 0.
10. **`comand`**: A list of strings obtained from the input line.
11. **`obj`**: The first element of `comand`.
12. **`com`**: The second element of `comand`.
13. **`pos`**: The value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`. This implies `pos` is a tuple `(i, ind)` representing the coordinates of `obj`.
14. **`nxt`**: Calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. This is the next position based on the movement command `com`.
15. **`player`**: Set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

- **`time`**: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is assumed to be defined somewhere in the code. Since its value is not given, we will represent it as `time`.
- **`player`**: This variable is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not. If `obj` is a player, `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to the element at the `nxt` position in `grid`.

### Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the output will be a formatted string containing the value of `time` followed by the `player` element and the word "ELIMINATED".

Since the exact values of `time` and `player` are not explicitly provided, we will describe them in terms of the given conditions.

### Final Output:

Output: **time player ELIMINATED (where time is the value of the time variable and player is the element determined based on the conditions provided)**
