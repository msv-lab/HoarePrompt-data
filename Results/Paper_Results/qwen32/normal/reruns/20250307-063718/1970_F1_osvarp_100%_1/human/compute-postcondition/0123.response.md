To determine what will be printed by the statement `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`, we need to analyze the provided initial state and identify the values or descriptions of `time` and `player`.

### Analysis of Variables:
1. **time**: The variable `time` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown from the provided information. However, given that it is used in a context where it seems to represent a time or a turn count in a game, we can assume it is an integer representing the current time or turn number.

2. **player**: The variable `player` is defined as `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Here:
   - `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list.
   - `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, where `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `mov` is a dictionary that maps commands to movement tuples.

Given the complexity and the fact that `obj` and `comand` are derived from input, we can infer that `player` could be any element from the grid or `comand` based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
- **time**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We can only describe it as an integer representing the current time or turn number.
- **player**: This variable is either `obj` (if `obj` is a player) or the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`. Since `obj` and `nxt` are derived from input and the state of the game, we can describe `player` as the element that gets eliminated at the current time or turn.

### Final Output:
Output: **time player ELIMINATED (where time is the current time or turn number, and player is the element that gets eliminated at the current time or turn)**
