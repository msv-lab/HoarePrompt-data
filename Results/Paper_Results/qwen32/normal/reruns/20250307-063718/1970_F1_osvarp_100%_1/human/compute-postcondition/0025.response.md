The code snippet `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and `ind` is 1. Therefore, the tuple `(0, 1)` will be appended to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` depending on the value of `tmp`.

The other variables such as `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `points`, and `line` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[0]: (0, 0), line[1]: (0, 1)}`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 1, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `goal[tmp]` has an additional element `(0, 1)` appended to it**.
