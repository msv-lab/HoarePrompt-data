To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables:

The given code snippet calculates a new position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and a movement vector from the `mov` dictionary associated with the command `com`. Specifically, it adds the movement vector to the current position.

Given:
- `pos` is the value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`.
- `mov` is a dictionary that contains movement vectors for different commands.

After executing the code snippet:
- `nxt` is calculated as a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `t`, `comand`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`) remain unchanged except for the new introduction of `nxt`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**
