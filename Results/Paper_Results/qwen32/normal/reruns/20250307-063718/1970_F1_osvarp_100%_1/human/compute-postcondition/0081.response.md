The code snippet appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp` in the `goal` dictionary. Given that `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and 1 otherwise, and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', the tuple `(i, ind)` will be added to either the first or second list in the `goal` dictionary based on the value of `line[ind][0]`.

Since `i` is 2 and `ind` is a valid index in `line`, the tuple `(2, ind)` will be added to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', or to `goal[1]` if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one string, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind) including the new entry `line[ind]: (2, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from `line` with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, and `line[ind]` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or to `goal[1]` if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1.**
