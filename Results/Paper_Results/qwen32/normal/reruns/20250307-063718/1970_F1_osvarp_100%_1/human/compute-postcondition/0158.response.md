To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state.

### Analyzing the Variables:

1. **`time`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since it is used in the print statement, we can assume it holds some integer value representing the current time or a counter. Since the exact value is not provided, we will denote it as `time`.

2. **`GoalName`**: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their names. Since the exact mapping is not provided, we will denote the value associated with `team` as `GoalName[team]`.

3. **`team`**: This variable is the value returned by the function `goalIn(pos)`. The function `goalIn` takes a position (`pos`) as input and returns a team identifier. Since the exact implementation of `goalIn` and the value of `pos` are not provided, we will denote the return value of `goalIn(pos)` as `team`.

### Putting It All Together:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `%d` will be replaced by the integer value of `time`.
- `%s` will be replaced by the string value of `GoalName[team]`.

### Final Output:

Based on the information provided, the print statement will output the current time followed by the goal name associated with the team identified by `team`.

Output: **time GoalName[team] (where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the name of the team identified by the value of team)**
