Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`. If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` is the third element of `comand`, `points` is [0, 0] if `el` is not equal to '.Q' and not equal to '.S', `points` is [10, 0] if `team` is 1 and `el` is '.S', `points` is [0, 10] if `team` is 0 and `el` is '.S', `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False except for `obj` which is True if `el` is '.Q'. Otherwise, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or if `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`, then `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not equal to -1, `points` is [0, 1] if `team` was 1, or `points` is [1, 0] if `team` was 0, where `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `points` remains [0, 0]. If `obj` is not '.B' and `obj` is a player element, `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. In all cases, `allPlayers[obj]` is False if `obj` is a player element, and `com` not being 'T' ensures that either `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`. If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. If `el` is '.S', `points` is updated to [10, 0] if `team` is 1, or [0, 10] if `team` is 0. If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S', `points` remains [0, 0]. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is True. Otherwise, if the length of `comand` is not 3, `allPlayers` remains a dictionary containing all player elements from all lines with a value of False. In both cases, if `obj` is equal to '.B', the value of `obj` in `elements` is updated to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `pos` is the value from `elements` associated with the key `obj`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is not '.B' and `obj` is a player element, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is -1, `points` remains unchanged. `time` is `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, and `time` is `t + 1`. If `comand` has three elements, `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. Otherwise, no changes are made to `team` or `points`. If `comand` does not have three elements, `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` from `elements`. If `obj` == '.B', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `elements` or `grid`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
