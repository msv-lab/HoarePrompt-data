Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, `elements` is updated to include `line[1]: (0, 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element `(0, 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `line[ind]` is equal to `'..'`, no changes are made to the variables.**
