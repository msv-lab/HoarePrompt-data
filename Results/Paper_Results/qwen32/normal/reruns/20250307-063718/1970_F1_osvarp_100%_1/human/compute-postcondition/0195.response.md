The `print` statement is formatted to display the final scores of two teams. The scores are accessed from the `points` list, where `points[0]` represents the score of the first team and `points[1]` represents the score of the second team.

Based on the initial state provided:
- `points` is a list containing the final scores of the two teams.
- The exact scores in `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not explicitly given, but they are the elements at index 0 and 1 of the `points` list, respectively.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the final scores of the two teams in the specified format.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the score of the first team and points[1] is the score of the second team)**
