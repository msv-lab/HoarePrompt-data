Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and `n` is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and `m` is odd, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, all of which are `line`, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from all lines with their coordinates (i, ind), `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains all goal elements with 'B' as the first character, and the second list contains all goal elements with a character other than 'B' as the first character, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`, `time` is `t + 1`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0.**

In simpler terms: The value of `team` is determined based on whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. If it is 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
