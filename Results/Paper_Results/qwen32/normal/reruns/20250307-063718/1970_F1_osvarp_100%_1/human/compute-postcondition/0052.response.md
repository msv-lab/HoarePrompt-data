Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 99 and m is odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input line and must have at least one element. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` is a dictionary containing all non-'..' elements from `line` with their coordinates (i, ind) and now includes `line[ind]` with the value (1, ind). If `line[ind]` is a player element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and its second character is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `(1, ind)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else appended to `goal[1]`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`. If `line[ind]` is '..', no changes occur to any of the variables.**
