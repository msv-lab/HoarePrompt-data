To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values of the variables involved:

1. **time**: This is calculated as `t + 1`, where `t` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, `time` is an integer greater than 1.
2. **player**: This is determined by the following logic:
   - `obj` is the first element of `comand`, which is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` from the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt` is the new coordinates calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, where `com` is the second element of `comand`.
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Given that the exact values of `obj`, `comand`, `elements`, `grid`, `mov`, and `isPlayer` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The print statement formats the output as `'%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player)`, where:
- `%d` is replaced by the value of `time`.
- `%s` is replaced by the value of `player`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `time` followed by the value of `player` and the string "ELIMINATED".

Output: **time player ELIMINATED (where time is t + 1, player is either obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
