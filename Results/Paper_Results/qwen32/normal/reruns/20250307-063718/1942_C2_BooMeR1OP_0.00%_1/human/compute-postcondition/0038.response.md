The code snippet `gaps.append(gap)` adds the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `next_elem` is `a[3 % x]`, the specific value of `gap` will depend on the values of `a`, `x`, and `i`. However, the structure and conditions for `gaps` remain as described: if `gap` is greater than 0, it is added twice to `gaps`; otherwise, it is added once.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 2; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `next_elem` is `a[3 % x]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `gaps` contains the element `gap` once or twice depending on whether `gap` is greater than 0.**
