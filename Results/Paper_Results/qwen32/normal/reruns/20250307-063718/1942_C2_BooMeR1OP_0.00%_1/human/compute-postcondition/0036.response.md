The provided code snippet modifies the value of the variable `next_elem`. Let's analyze the change:

- The new value of `next_elem` is calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`.
- Given `i` is initially 2, the expression becomes `a[(2 + 1) % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`.
- Simplifying, `next_elem` becomes `a[3 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`, which is `a[3 % x]` if `i` is not `x - 1`, or `a[3 % x] + n` if `i` is `x - 1`.

Since the initial condition specifies `i` is 2, and `x > 2` (as `x` is at least 2 and `next_elem` is defined as `a[2]` if `x > 2`), we need to consider whether `i` is `x - 1`:
- If `x > 3`, then `i` is not `x - 1`, so `next_elem` is `a[3]`.
- If `x == 3`, then `i` is `x - 1`, so `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.

However, the problem does not specify whether `x` is exactly 3 or greater than 3. Therefore, we consider both cases:
- If `x > 3`, `next_elem` is `a[3]`.
- If `x == 3`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.

Since we need to provide a specific output state, we consider the general case where `x > 3` (as it is the more common scenario and the problem does not specify `x` to be exactly 3).

Thus, the new value of `next_elem` is `a[3 % x]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 2; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `next_elem` is `a[3 % x]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` > 0, `gaps` contains the element `gap` twice; otherwise, `gaps` contains `gap` once.**
