Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 1; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2` else `a[0]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` > 0, `gaps` contains the element `gap` twice; otherwise, `gaps` contains `gap` once.**
