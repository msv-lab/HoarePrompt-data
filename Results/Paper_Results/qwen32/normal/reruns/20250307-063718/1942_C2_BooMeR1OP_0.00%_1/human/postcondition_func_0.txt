The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and the value of `y`. The final value of `ans` represents the sum of processed gaps adjusted by the number of pairs that can be fully used from `y`.
