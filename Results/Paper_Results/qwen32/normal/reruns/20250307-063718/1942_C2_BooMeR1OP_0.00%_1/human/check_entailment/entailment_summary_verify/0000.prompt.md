You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and the value of `y`. The final value of `ans` represents the sum of processed gaps adjusted by the number of pairs that can be fully used from `y`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is flawed.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2`. This seems to be an incorrect assumption. The number of triangles formed initially depends on the arrangement of the vertices and the gaps between them, not just the number of vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Counting Triangles with Neighbors**: The loop that checks for `t1` and `t2` (the next two vertices in a clockwise direction) is incorrect. It only checks if `t2` is in `present` and `t1` is not, but it does not correctly account for the formation of triangles. It should consider all possible pairs of vertices that can form a triangle with the current vertex.

3. **Handling Gaps**: The logic for handling gaps between the chosen vertices is also flawed. The program attempts to fill gaps with additional vertices to maximize triangles, but it does not correctly account for the constraints or the optimal way to place these vertices to form the maximum number of triangles.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the vertices chosen by Bessie are already forming a set of triangles, the program might not correctly identify this and might incorrectly assume it needs to add more vertices.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
With vertices 1, 3, and 5, we can form 3 non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), and (5, 6, 1).

However, the program will output a different result because it does not correctly handle the initial arrangement of vertices.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is False.
