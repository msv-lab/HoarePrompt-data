The code snippet provided modifies the list `a` by subtracting 1 from each element in the list. This means that each element in `a` will be one less than its original value.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

After the execution of the code snippet `a = [(num - 1) for num in a]`, each element in the list `a` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1.**
