The code snippet `gaps.append(gap)` appends the current value of `gap` to the `gaps` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 0; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `gaps` is a list containing the single element `gap`; `next_elem` is `a[1]`; `gap` is `a[1] - a[0] - 1` and the current value of `gap` is greater than 0.**
