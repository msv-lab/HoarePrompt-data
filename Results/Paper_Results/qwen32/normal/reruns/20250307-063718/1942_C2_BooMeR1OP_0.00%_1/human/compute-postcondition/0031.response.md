The code snippet updates the value of `next_elem` based on the current value of `i`. Specifically, `next_elem` is set to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`. Given the initial conditions, we need to determine the new value of `next_elem`.

- If `i` is not `x - 1`, `next_elem` becomes `a[(i + 1) % x]`.
- If `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` becomes `a[0] + n`.

Since `i` is initially 1, `i` is not `x - 1`, so `next_elem` is updated to `a[(1 + 1) % x]`, which simplifies to `a[2 % x]` or `a[2]` if `x > 2`. If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` becomes `a[0]`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 1; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `gaps` is a list containing the single element `gap` if `gap` > 0; `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2` else `a[0]`; `gap` is `a[1] - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains `gap`; otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.**
