The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `x - 2`. After the increment, `ans` becomes `x - 1`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `ans` is `x - 1`; `i` is 0; `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`; `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`.**
