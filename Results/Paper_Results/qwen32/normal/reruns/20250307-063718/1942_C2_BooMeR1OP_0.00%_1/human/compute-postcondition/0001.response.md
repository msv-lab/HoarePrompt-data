The code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The list `a` now contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
