Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Counting Triangles**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. The logic for counting triangles based on the gaps between chosen vertices is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the possibility of forming triangles with additional vertices that can be chosen.

2. **Handling Gaps**: The program attempts to use gaps between chosen vertices to determine how many additional vertices can be used to form triangles. However, the logic for calculating the number of triangles from these gaps is incorrect. The program does not properly handle the fact that multiple triangles can be formed within a single gap.

3. **Choosing Additional Vertices**: The program does not correctly determine which additional vertices to choose to maximize the number of triangles. The logic for choosing vertices based on gaps is not optimal and does not account for all possible configurations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, when there are no gaps or when the gaps are very small, the program may not correctly calculate the number of triangles.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal set of vertices to choose in order to maximize the number of triangles. The current program does not implement such an approach and thus does not produce the correct results for all test cases.
