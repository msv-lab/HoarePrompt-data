The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables (`t` and the list of vertices) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not yet assigned specific values. After the execution of the code, `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; additionally, the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
