Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is `x - 1`; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, then `ans` is `x + (number of times the condition was met during the loop)`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + (number of times the condition was met during the loop)`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `x - 1`, meaning the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`. The variables `t1` and `t2` will be calculated based on the last element of `a`. The variable `ans` will be `x - 2` plus the number of times during the loop that the condition `(t1 not in present and t2 in present)` was true.
