The code snippet calculates the value of `next_elem` based on the current value of `i` and the list `a`. Here's the updated state:

- `next_elem` is calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`.
- Since `i` is initially 0, `next_elem` becomes `a[1] + (n if 0 == x - 1 else 0)`, which simplifies to `a[1]` because `i` is not `x - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, the list `a`, the set `present`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, and `gaps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, each decreased by 1, sorted in ascending order; `present` is a set of the `x` distinct integers from `a`; `i` is 0; `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`; `gaps` is an empty list; `next_elem` is `a[1]`.**
