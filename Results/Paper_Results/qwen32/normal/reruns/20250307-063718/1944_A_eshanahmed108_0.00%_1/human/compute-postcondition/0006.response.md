The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the range generated by `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have already processed one iteration, so the range would have been decremented by 1.

Given that `n` is the first integer from the input and `k` is the second integer from the input, the loop will execute `n` times. After the previous iteration, the loop has already executed once, so `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `k` is the second integer from the input**
