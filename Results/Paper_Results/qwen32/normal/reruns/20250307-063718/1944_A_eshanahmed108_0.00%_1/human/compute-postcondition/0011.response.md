Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). For each test case, it prints the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying at most `k` bridges. If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints 1.**
