In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate.

Given the context of the problem, the loop will execute based on the number of test cases, which is determined by the first integer `n` in each test case. However, the loop head itself only depends on the integer provided by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since the problem states that there are multiple test cases and each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `k`, the input to `int(input())` should be the number of test cases.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**
