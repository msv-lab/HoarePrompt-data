You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by two integers n and k, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of islands and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) represents the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: a series of integers where each integer is the result of the condition `n - k <= 1` for each test case, printed one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). For each test case, it prints the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying at most `k` bridges. If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a set of islands where all pairs of islands are initially connected by bridges. Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges, and the goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1. Everule can visit an island if there is a path from island 1 to that island using the remaining bridges.

### Key Observations:
1. If no bridges are destroyed (`k = 0`), Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. If Dominater destroys all possible bridges (`k = n*(n-1)/2`), Everule can only visit island 1.
3. The critical insight is that if Dominater can isolate island 1 by destroying bridges to all other islands, Everule will only be able to visit island 1. This can be achieved by destroying `n-1` bridges (one to each of the other islands).

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

Let's break down the logic:
- The program iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It then prints `n` if `n - k <= 1` (meaning that Dominater cannot isolate island 1), otherwise, it prints `1` (meaning that Dominater can isolate island 1).

### Verification:
- If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1, so the output should be `1`.
- If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, so the output should be `n`.

The condition `n - k <= 1` in the program correctly captures these scenarios:
- If `n - k <= 1`, it means `k >= n-1`, so Dominater can isolate island 1, and the output is `1`.
- If `n - k > 1`, it means `k < n-1`, so Dominater cannot isolate island 1, and the output is `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the number of bridges Dominater can destroy.
