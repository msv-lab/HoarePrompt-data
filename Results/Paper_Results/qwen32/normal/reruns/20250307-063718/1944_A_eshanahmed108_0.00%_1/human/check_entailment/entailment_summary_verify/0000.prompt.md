You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). For each test case, it prints the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying at most `k` bridges. If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed when `n - k > 1`. The program always returns 1 in this case, which is not always correct.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `n - k <= 1`, the program correctly returns `n`. This means that if the number of bridges destroyed (`k`) is such that fewer or equal to one bridge remains, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.
- However, if `n - k > 1`, the program always returns 1. This is incorrect because Dominater can only destroy up to `k` bridges, and it may not be possible to disconnect all islands from island 1 by destroying only `k` bridges.

For example, consider the case `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The total number of bridges is `6`. If Dominater destroys 2 bridges, it may not be possible to disconnect all islands from island 1. For instance, if Dominater destroys the bridges between (1, 2) and (1, 3), Everule can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4 by using the bridge between (3, 4). Therefore, the correct answer should be 3 or 4, not 1.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where `n - k > 1` correctly, making it incorrect.
