Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). The function returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying at most `k` bridges.**
