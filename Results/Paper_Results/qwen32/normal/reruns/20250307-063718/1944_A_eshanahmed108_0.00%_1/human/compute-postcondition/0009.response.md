To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it processes each test case.

The loop processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `T`, from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
3. It then prints `n` if `n - k <= 1`; otherwise, it prints `1`.

Given the loop structure, the output of each test case is independent of the others. The final output state will be a series of outputs, one for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume the input consists of three test cases:
```
3
5 2
3 3
10 0
```

Processing each test case:
1. For the first test case (`n=5`, `k=2`):
   - `n - k = 5 - 2 = 3` which is greater than 1.
   - Output: `1`
2. For the second test case (`n=3`, `k=3`):
   - `n - k = 3 - 3 = 0` which is less than or equal to 1.
   - Output: `3`
3. For the third test case (`n=10`, `k=0`):
   - `n - k = 10 - 0 = 10` which is greater than 1.
   - Output: `1`

Thus, the complete output for these three test cases would be:
```
1
3
1
```

### Generalizing the Output State:
The output state after all iterations is a sequence of outputs, one for each test case, determined by the condition `n - k <= 1`. Each output is either `n` or `1`.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the condition for each test case.

Given the format requirement, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **a series of integers where each integer is the result of the condition `n - k <= 1` for each test case, printed one per line.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the final set of printed values after processing all test cases, each value being either `n` or `1` based on the condition.
