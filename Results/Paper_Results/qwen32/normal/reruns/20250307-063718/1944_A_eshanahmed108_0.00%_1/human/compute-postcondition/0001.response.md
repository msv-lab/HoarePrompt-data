The code reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

In simple terms: The first integer from the input is assigned to `n`, and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The precondition about the input being a positive integer for the number of test cases is still valid.
