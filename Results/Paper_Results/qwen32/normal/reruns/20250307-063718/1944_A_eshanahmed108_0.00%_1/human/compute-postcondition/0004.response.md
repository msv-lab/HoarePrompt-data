Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is the first integer from the input and `k` is the second integer from the input, which remains unchanged after the code execution.
