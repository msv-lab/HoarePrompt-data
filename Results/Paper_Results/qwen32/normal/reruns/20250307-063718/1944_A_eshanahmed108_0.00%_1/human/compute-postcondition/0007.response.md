The code snippet assigns the values from the input to `n` and `k`. Given that the initial state of `n` is described as `n - 1`, this state is overwritten by the input value for `n`. The variable `k` is assigned the second integer from the input. Therefore, the initial state of `n` is no longer valid, and `n` and `k` take on the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
