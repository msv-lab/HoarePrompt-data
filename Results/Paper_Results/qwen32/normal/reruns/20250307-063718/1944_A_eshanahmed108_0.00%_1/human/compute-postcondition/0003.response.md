The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value provided by `int(input())`. Since the underscore is not used within the loop, we only need to consider the state of the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input. The loop will execute as long as the number of test cases (provided by `int(input())`) is greater than 0. 

Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, we need to consider the state of the input for the next iteration. After the first iteration, the number of test cases would have decreased by 1.

However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head and the loop head does not include `n` or `k` directly, we can infer that the state of the input (the number of test cases) should be decreased by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases minus 1**.
