The provided initial state gives us the following information about the variables:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers.
- `x` is explicitly defined as `k - 1`.
- `a` is defined to be greater than or equal to `x + 3`, which translates to `a >= (k - 1) + 3` or `a >= k + 2`.
- `t` is greater than 0, but it is not used in the provided print statement.
- The current value of `a` is at least `k + 2`.

The Python code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
