In the given task, the initial state describes the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers with values provided by the input, and `t` as an integer greater than 0. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
