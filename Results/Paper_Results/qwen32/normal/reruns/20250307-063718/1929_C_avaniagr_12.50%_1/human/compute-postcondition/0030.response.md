Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is at least `k + 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1` and `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
