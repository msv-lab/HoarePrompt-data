The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, `t`, and `z`) and their relationships, but these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement. The statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables.
2. The variables `k`, `x`, `a`, `t`, and `z` are mentioned but are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The description of how `z` is updated using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` `x + 1` times does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
4. The condition that `a` is greater than or equal to `z` also does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
