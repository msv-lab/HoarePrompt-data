Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 1. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the state remains as given in the if part. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then the state remains as given in the else part. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are preserved. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, or if `x` does not equal `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `z` is updated `x + 1` times using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `a` is compared to `z`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
