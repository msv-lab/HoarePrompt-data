The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the types and values of the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`, and the condition that `t` is greater than 1.
2. The print statement does not reference any of these variables; it simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
