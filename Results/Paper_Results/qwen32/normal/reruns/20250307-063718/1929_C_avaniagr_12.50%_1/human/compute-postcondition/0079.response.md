Let's analyze the loop and the provided information step by step to determine the output state after all the iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it performs the following:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. **Condition Checks**:
    - If `x < k - 1`:
        - If `a >= x + 1`, print "YES".
        - Otherwise, print "NO".
    - If `x == k - 1`:
        - If `a >= x + 3`, print "YES".
        - Otherwise, print "NO".
    - If `x > k - 1`:
        - Compute `z` iteratively as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
        - If `a >= z`, print "YES".
        - Otherwise, print "NO".

### State After All Iterations
The loop processes each test case independently and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` change with each iteration as new values are read from the input. The variable `t` determines the number of iterations and remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Output State
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above.

### Final Output State
The final output state is determined by the results of all the test cases. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will have been updated for each test case, but `t` remains the same. The output is a series of "YES" or "NO" printed for each test case.

### Final Answer
Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each being either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the loop will have printed "YES" or "NO" for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided. The specific output for each test case depends on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for that test case.
