To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he follows a specific strategy based on the values of \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). The strategy depends on the relationship between \( k \) and \( x \):

1. If \( x < k - 1 \):
    - Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he has at least \( x + 1 \) coins initially.
2. If \( x == k - 1 \):
    - Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he has at least \( x + 3 \) coins initially.
3. If \( x > k - 1 \):
    - The program calculates a value \( z \) through a loop, where \( z \) is supposed to represent the minimum number of coins needed to ensure that Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. The loop iterates \( x + 1 \) times, updating \( z \) in each iteration.

Let's examine the logic in the program:

- For \( x < k - 1 \):
    - The program correctly checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- For \( x == k - 1 \):
    - The program correctly checks if \( a \geq x + 3 \) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- For \( x > k - 1 \):
    - The program calculates \( z \) using the loop. However, the formula used to update \( z \) inside the loop seems incorrect. The loop should correctly simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins, ensuring that Sasha can still guarantee to win any number of coins.

Let's consider the loop for \( x > k - 1 \):
```python
z = 0
for i in range(x + 1):
    z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```
This loop is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win. However, the formula \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) does not correctly simulate the scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins.

The correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure that after \( x \) consecutive losses, Sasha still has enough coins to recover and start winning again. The correct formula for \( z \) should be:
\[ z = \sum_{i=0}^{x} \left( \left\lceil \frac{z_i}{k-1} \right\rceil \right) \]
where \( z_i \) is the amount of coins after \( i \) consecutive losses.

Given the complexity of the correct formula, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic for \( x > k - 1 \).

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
