The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
3. The string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
