The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, and `x` is at least `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. Since `x` is at least `k`, `x + 1` is at least `k + 1`, so the loop can execute again.

State: **`k`, `x` is at least `k`, `a` are integers with values provided by the input; `t` is greater than 0; `z` is 1; `i` is `k + 1`**
