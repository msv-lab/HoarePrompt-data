The provided code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` directly. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `t` with the value from the input.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 30, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10^9. There are `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) such test cases; `t` is an input integer.**
