You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES

    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each being either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions specified for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`, and prints "YES" if it does, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and find an example where the program does not work as expected.

### Analysis of the Program

The program attempts to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino. The logic in the program is based on specific conditions for `x` and `k`, but it does not fully account for all possible scenarios.

### Key Issues

1. **Handling of `x < k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 1` for this case. However, this condition might not be sufficient to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For example, if `k` is large and `x` is small, Sasha might not be able to recover from a series of losses even if `a >= x + 1`.

2. **Handling of `x == k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 3` for this case. Again, this condition might not be sufficient. The logic here seems arbitrary and does not cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Handling of `x > k - 1`**: The program calculates `z` using a loop that seems to simulate the accumulation of coins, but this logic is not well-defined and does not guarantee correctness. The loop does not correctly simulate the betting strategy described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior

Let's consider a test case where the program might fail:

- **Input**: `k = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = 5`
- **Expected Output**: `YES`
- **Program Output**: `NO`

**Explanation**:
- With `k = 3` and `x = 2`, Sasha can use the following strategy:
  - If he wins, he bets 1 coin and gets 3 coins back (net gain of 2 coins).
  - If he loses, he bets 2 coins but can still afford to bet 1 coin in the next round if he wins, and so on.
- Starting with `a = 5`, Sasha can afford to lose up to 2 times in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting and potentially reach any number of coins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case, indicating that the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
