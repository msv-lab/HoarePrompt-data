The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values and conditions of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is a literal string in the code.
3. The variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
