The code snippet provided is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` directly. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `z`, and `i` are provided or defined in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a fixed string.

Output: **YES**
