Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and the condition that `t` is greater than 1 are preserved.**
