In this task, we are given an initial state where `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with specific values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. However, the print statement in the code snippet does not use any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are mentioned in the initial state.
2. The value of `t` being greater than 0 is also mentioned.
3. The print statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`, their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
