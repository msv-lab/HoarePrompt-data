The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t` as provided in the initial state. The print statement is hardcoded to output the string 'NO'.

Let's break down the initial state for clarity:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is less than `x + 3`.

However, none of these variables are used in the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
