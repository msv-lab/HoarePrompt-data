The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. The statement `print('NO')` will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the values and relationships of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t`.
2. The `print` statement in the code does not reference any of these variables.
3. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
