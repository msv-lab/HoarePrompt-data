Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `k` is between 2 and 30, `x` is between 1 and 100, and `a` is between 1 and 10^9. For each test case, the function performs a calculation or check (not detailed here) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
