The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state mentions that `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` in any way.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `k`, `x`, and `a` now hold the integer values provided by the input, and `t` remains greater than 0 with its previous value unchanged.
