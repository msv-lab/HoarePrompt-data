Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and find an example where the program does not work as expected.

### Analysis of the Program

The program attempts to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino. The logic in the program is based on specific conditions for `x` and `k`, but it does not fully account for all possible scenarios.

### Key Issues

1. **Handling of `x < k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 1` for this case. However, this condition might not be sufficient to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For example, if `k` is large and `x` is small, Sasha might not be able to recover from a series of losses even if `a >= x + 1`.

2. **Handling of `x == k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 3` for this case. Again, this condition might not be sufficient. The logic here seems arbitrary and does not cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Handling of `x > k - 1`**: The program calculates `z` using a loop that seems to simulate the accumulation of coins, but this logic is not well-defined and does not guarantee correctness. The loop does not correctly simulate the betting strategy described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior

Let's consider a test case where the program might fail:

- **Input**: `k = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = 5`
- **Expected Output**: `YES`
- **Program Output**: `NO`

**Explanation**:
- With `k = 3` and `x = 2`, Sasha can use the following strategy:
  - If he wins, he bets 1 coin and gets 3 coins back (net gain of 2 coins).
  - If he loses, he bets 2 coins but can still afford to bet 1 coin in the next round if he wins, and so on.
- Starting with `a = 5`, Sasha can afford to lose up to 2 times in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting and potentially reach any number of coins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case, indicating that the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
