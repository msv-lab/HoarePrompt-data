The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 1, the code only affects `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 1.**
