To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and what the final value of `z` will be given the loop runs `x + 1` times. 

The loop increments `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. However, since `z` starts at 0, in the first iteration, `z` becomes 1 (0 // (k - 1) + 1). In the second iteration, `z` becomes 2 (1 // (k - 1) + 1), and so forth. Essentially, `z` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given that the loop runs `x + 1` times, `z` will be incremented by 1 for each of these iterations. Therefore, the final value of `z` will be `x + 1`.

The other variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged; `z` is `x + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `z` will be equal to `x + 1`, while the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` will stay the same as they were initially.
