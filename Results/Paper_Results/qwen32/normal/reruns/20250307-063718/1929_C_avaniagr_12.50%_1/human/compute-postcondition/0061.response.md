The `print('NO')` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t`. The print statement is explicitly given the string `'NO'` to print, and there are no operations or conditions that alter this string based on the initial state provided.

Output: **NO**
