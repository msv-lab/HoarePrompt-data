The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement. The initial state describes the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers with specific values (though these values are not explicitly provided), and `t` as an integer greater than 1. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`.

Output: **YES**
