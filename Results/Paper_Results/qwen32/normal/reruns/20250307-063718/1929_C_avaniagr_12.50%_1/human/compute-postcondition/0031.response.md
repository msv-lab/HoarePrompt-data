Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is at least `k + 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1` (which is a contradiction and thus not possible), then `z` is `x + 1` and `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. However, since the case `x >= k - 1` and `x != k - 1` cannot occur, we only consider `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.**

Simplified: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, `a` is at least `k + 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 3`.**
