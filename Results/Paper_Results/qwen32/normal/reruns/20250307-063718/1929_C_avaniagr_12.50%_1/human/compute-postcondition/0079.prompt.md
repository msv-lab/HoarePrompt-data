Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 30, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10^9. There are `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) such test cases; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is at least `k + 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1` (which is a contradiction and thus not possible), then `z` is `x + 1` and `a` is at least `x + 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. However, since the case `x >= k - 1` and `x != k - 1` cannot occur, we only consider `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x < k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, `z` is computed by the recursive formula after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is set to `x + 1`, and `a` is less than `z`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, `z` is computed by the recursive formula after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is set to `x + 1`, and `a` is compared to `z`: if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 1. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the state remains as given in the if part. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then the state remains as given in the else part. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are preserved. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, or if `x` does not equal `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `z` is updated `x + 1` times using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `a` is compared to `z`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
