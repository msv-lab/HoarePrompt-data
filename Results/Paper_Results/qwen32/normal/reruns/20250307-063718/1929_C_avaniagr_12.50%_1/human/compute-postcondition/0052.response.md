Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, `t` is greater than 0, `z` is the value computed by the recursive formula after `x + 1` iterations, and `i` is `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
