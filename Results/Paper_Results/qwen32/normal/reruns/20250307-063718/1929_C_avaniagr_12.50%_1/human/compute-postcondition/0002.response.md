The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Therefore, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated to the values provided in the input.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

In plain English: The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` now hold the integer values provided by the input, while the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
