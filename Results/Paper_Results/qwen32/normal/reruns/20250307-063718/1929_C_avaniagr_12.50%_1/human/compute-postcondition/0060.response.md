In the given task, the initial state describes the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers provided by the input, and `t` as an integer greater than 1. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
