### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. The logic considers different scenarios based on the values of `k` and `x` relative to each other and to the initial number of coins `a`. 

1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` is checked. If true, Sasha can achieve any number of coins. Otherwise, he cannot.
   
2. **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
   - The condition `a >= x + 3` is checked. If true, Sasha can achieve any number of coins. Otherwise, he cannot.
   
3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
   - A loop calculates a value `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations. If `a >= z`, Sasha can achieve any number of coins. Otherwise, he cannot.

The logic seems to be derived from the idea that if Sasha can maintain a certain minimum number of coins (`x + 1` or `x + 3`), he can use a strategy to ensure he can always recover from losing up to `x` consecutive bets and eventually achieve any number of coins. The loop in the third case calculates a more complex threshold based on the compounding effect of winning and losing.

The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement and the execution summary. It checks the conditions and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether the initial number of coins `a` meets the calculated thresholds.
