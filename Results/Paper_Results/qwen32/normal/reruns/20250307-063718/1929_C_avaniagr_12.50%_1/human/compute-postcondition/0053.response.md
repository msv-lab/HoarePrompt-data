Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values provided by the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, then `z` is the value computed by the recursive formula after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is `x + 1`, and `a` is less than `z`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is the value computed by the recursive formula after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is `x + 1`, and `a` is compared to `z`: if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**

In simpler terms: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and `t` is greater than 0. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is at least `x + 3`, no changes occur. Otherwise, `z` is calculated recursively after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is set to `x + 1`, and `a` is compared to `z`, retaining the comparison result.**
