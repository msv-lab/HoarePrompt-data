Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, meaning the number of "(" equals the number of ")", and the balance of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The variable `d` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `s`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no other operations were performed on them.
