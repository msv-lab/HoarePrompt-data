Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s`, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least one tuple, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s` concatenated with the original value of `ans`, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least two tuples, `i` and `j` are the second tuple in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s` concatenated with the original value of `ans` and the character at position `i` in `s` again, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least three tuples, `i` and `j` are the third tuple in `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
