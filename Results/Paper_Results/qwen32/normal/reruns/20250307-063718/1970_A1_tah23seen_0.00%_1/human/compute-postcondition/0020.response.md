The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` by its values and assigns the sorted result back to `d`. Since `d` was originally a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1` and values representing the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s`, after sorting, `d` becomes a list of tuples sorted by these balance values.

Output State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.**
