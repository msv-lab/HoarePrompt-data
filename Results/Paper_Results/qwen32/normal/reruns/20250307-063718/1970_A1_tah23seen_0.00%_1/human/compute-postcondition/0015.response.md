Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i + 1]` set to `d[i] + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated such that the value of `d` at key `i + 1` is now `d[i] + 1`. The other variables `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` retain their previous states with `i` being incremented by 1.
