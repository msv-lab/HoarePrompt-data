Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, meaning the number of "(" equals the number of ")", and the balance of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

In simple terms, the string `s` remains balanced with an equal number of opening and closing parentheses, and the balance of any prefix of `s` is non-negative. The length of `s` remains `n`. The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
