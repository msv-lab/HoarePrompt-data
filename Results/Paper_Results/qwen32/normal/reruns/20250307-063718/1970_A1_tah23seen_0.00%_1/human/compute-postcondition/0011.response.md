Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i + 1]` equal to `d[i] + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated such that the value at key `i + 1` is now `d[i] + 1`. The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, and the previous value of `i` remain unchanged.
