#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, meaning the number of "(" equals the number of ")", and the balance of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0`, and intermediate values representing the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`. `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty balanced string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and returns a new string `ans` formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position.
