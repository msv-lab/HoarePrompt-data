Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys 0 and `i + 1`, where `d[0]` is 0 and `d[i + 1]` is 1, the current character `s[i]` is '('**

In simpler terms, the dictionary `d` now has an additional key `i + 1` with a value of 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.
