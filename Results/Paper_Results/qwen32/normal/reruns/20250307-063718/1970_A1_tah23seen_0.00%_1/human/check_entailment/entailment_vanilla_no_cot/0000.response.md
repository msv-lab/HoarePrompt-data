Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the sorting criteria and the handling of the positions and balance values.

Here are the specific problems:

1. The sorting criteria should be based on the prefix balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order when the prefix balances are the same. However, the current code sorts primarily by prefix balance in increasing order and secondarily by position in increasing order (due to the default behavior of the `sorted` function in Python).

2. The code correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position, but the sorting step does not break ties in position by decreasing order, which is a requirement for the balanced shuffle operation.

To fix the program, the sorting step should be modified to sort by prefix balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order. This can be achieved by using a tuple with negative position as the secondary sorting key.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    ans = ''.join(s[i] for _, i in d[1:])  # Exclude the initial balance 0 at position 0
    return ans
```

With this correction, the program should correctly compute the balanced shuffle of the input parentheses sequence.
