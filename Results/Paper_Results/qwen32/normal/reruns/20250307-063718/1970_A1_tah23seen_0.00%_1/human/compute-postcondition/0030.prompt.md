You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, meaning the number of "(" equals the number of ")", and the balance of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0`, and intermediate values representing the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`. `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty balanced string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")". The function returns a string `ans` formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in a dictionary `d`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
