### Reasoning:

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and performs the balanced shuffle operation on it as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads the input string `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
   - It creates a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the prefix at each position. The balance is calculated as the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses encountered up to that point.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the balance based on whether the character is an opening parenthesis `(` (increment balance) or a closing parenthesis `)` (decrement balance).
   - The balance at each position is stored in the dictionary `d` with the position as the key and the balance as the value.

3. **Sorting**:
   - After calculating the balance for each position, the function removes the last balance value (which corresponds to the total balance of the string, and should be 0 for a balanced sequence).
   - It sorts the items in the dictionary `d` based on the balance in increasing order. In case of a tie (i.e., same balance), it sorts by position in decreasing order.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - The function constructs the final result string `ans` by iterating over the sorted list of items and appending the character from the original string `s` at the corresponding position to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

### Execution Summary Analysis:
- The execution summary correctly describes the function's behavior, indicating that it rearranges the characters of the input string based on the prefix balance, which aligns with the problem statement.
- The provided example in the problem statement (`(()(()))` -> `()(()())`) is consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
