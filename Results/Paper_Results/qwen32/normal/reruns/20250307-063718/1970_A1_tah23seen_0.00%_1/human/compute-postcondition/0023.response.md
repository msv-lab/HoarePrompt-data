The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, which are derived from the first tuple in the list `d`. Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `d`, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time by considering the next tuple in `d`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in `d`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` and `j` should be the next tuple in `d`. We do not have specific values for the next tuple, but we know `d` must contain at least one more tuple for the loop to continue.

State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s`, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least two tuples, `i` and `j` are the second tuple in `d`**
