The code snippet `ans += s[i]` concatenates the character at position `i` in the string `s` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` already includes the character at position `i` in `s` concatenated with its original value. After executing the code, `ans` will now include an additional character at position `i` from `s`.

Therefore, the character at position `i` in `s` will be added once more to `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s` concatenated with the original value of `ans` and the character at position `i` in `s` again, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least three tuples, `i` and `j` are the third tuple in `d`.**
