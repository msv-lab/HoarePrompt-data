You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, meaning the number of "(" equals the number of ")", and the balance of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0`, and intermediate values representing the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`. `s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty balanced string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and returns a new string `ans` formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the input string `s` using `input()`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` with the input string.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - `n` is set to the length of the string `s`.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to accumulate the result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with a single key-value pair `{0: 0}`. This dictionary will store the prefix balance at each position.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by 1.
     - The balance at position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - After the loop, the key-value pair corresponding to the last position `n` is removed from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values (second element of each key-value pair) in increasing order. In case of ties, the positions (first element of each key-value pair) are sorted in decreasing order. This is achieved by the sorting key `lambda x: x[1]`, which only considers the balance. However, the problem specifies that ties should be broken by position in decreasing order, which is not implemented correctly here. The correct sorting key should be `lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`.
   - The program then constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.

### Issues Identified:
- The sorting key in `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` does not correctly handle the tie-breaking requirement. It should sort by balance first and then by position in decreasing order.
- Due to the incorrect sorting key, the output sequence may not meet the requirements of the balanced shuffle operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
