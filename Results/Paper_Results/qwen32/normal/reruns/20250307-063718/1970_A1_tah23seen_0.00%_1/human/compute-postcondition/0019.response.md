The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0`. After executing `d.pop(n)`, the key `n` and its associated value `0` are removed from the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1` where `d[0] = 0` and intermediate values representing the balance of parentheses at each position in the string.**
