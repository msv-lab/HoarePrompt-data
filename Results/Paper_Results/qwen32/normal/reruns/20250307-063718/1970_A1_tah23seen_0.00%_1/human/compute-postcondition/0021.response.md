The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `d`. If `d` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `d` must contain at least one tuple. The values of `i` and `j` will be the first tuple in `d` when the loop starts.

State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string that must contain at least one tuple, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in `d`**
