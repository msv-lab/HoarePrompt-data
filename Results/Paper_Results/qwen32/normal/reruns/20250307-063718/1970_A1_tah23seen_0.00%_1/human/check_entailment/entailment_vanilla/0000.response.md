Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the input string `s` using `input()`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` with the input string.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - `n` is set to the length of the string `s`.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to accumulate the result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with a single key-value pair `{0: 0}`. This dictionary will store the prefix balance at each position.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by 1.
     - The balance at position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - After the loop, the key-value pair corresponding to the last position `n` is removed from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values (second element of each key-value pair) in increasing order. In case of ties, the positions (first element of each key-value pair) are sorted in decreasing order. This is achieved by the sorting key `lambda x: x[1]`, which only considers the balance. However, the problem specifies that ties should be broken by position in decreasing order, which is not implemented correctly here. The correct sorting key should be `lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`.
   - The program then constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.

### Issues Identified:
- The sorting key in `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` does not correctly handle the tie-breaking requirement. It should sort by balance first and then by position in decreasing order.
- Due to the incorrect sorting key, the output sequence may not meet the requirements of the balanced shuffle operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
