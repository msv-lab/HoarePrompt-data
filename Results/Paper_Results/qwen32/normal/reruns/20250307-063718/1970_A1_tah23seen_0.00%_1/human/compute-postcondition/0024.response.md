The code `ans += s[i]` appends the character at position `i` in the string `s` to the variable `ans`. Given that `s` is a balanced string of parentheses and `i` is the second tuple in the list `d` (which contains positions in `s` sorted by the balance of parentheses), the character at position `i` in `s` is appended to `ans`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` will be the original value of `ans` concatenated with the character `s[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is a balanced string of parentheses, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the character at position `i` in `s` concatenated with the original value of `ans`, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s` that must contain at least two tuples, `i` and `j` are the second tuple in `d`.**
