The code snippet provided modifies the dictionary `d` by setting `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `d[i]`, we can only express the new value in terms of the previous one. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
