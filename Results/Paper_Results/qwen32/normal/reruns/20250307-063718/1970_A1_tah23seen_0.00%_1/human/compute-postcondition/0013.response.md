Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that the sequence is balanced, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is '(', then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`. If `s[i]` is ')', then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.**
