Output State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0 and one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `solve()` has been executed twice.**

Explanation: The code snippet simply calls the `solve()` function again. The precondition that the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0 and one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration still holds. The only change is that `solve()` has now been executed twice instead of once.
