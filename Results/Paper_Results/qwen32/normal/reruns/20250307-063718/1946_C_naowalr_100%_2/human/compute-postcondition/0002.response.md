To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

Given:
- The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop will execute as long as the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.
2. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition.
3. After each iteration, the loop reads a new integer from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must also be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that a new integer has been read and it must be greater than 0.

State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**.
