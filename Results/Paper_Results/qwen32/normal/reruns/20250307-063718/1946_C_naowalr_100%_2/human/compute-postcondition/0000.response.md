In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the integer value read from standard input. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the integer value obtained from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

To ensure the loop executes, this integer value must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `_` is not something we can directly adjust before the loop starts, as it is assigned during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that the integer read from standard input is greater than 0.

State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**.
