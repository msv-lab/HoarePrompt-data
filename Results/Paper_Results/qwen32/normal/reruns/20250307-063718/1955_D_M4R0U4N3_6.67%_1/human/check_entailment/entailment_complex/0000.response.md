### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments in array `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing elements of `b`. This represents the elements from `b` that we still need to find in the current subsegment of `a`.
   - `done` is initialized as an empty set, which will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are also in `b`.
   - `extra` is initialized as an empty set, which will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are not in `b`.

2. **Initial Window**:
   - The program processes the first subsegment of `a` (from index `0` to `m-1`).
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`. If yes, it sets `ans` to `1`; otherwise, it sets `ans` to `0`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent subsegment of `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`), the program slides the window one element to the right.
   - It removes the element that is no longer in the window (`old = a[r - m]`) from either `done` or `extra`.
   - If `old` was in `done`, it is moved back to `todo`.
   - It adds the new element in the window (`a[r]`) to either `done` or `extra`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`. If yes, it increments `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, the program prints the value of `ans` for the current test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments. It maintains the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of the elements in the current window and checks if the number of matching elements is at least `k` for each window.
- **Efficiency**: The program processes each element of `a` exactly once for each test case, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
