The code snippet provided adds the value `a[r]` to the set `done`. The initial state already described the manipulation of several variables and sets (`r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and the list `a`).

Let's break down the changes:
- `r` has been incremented by 1.
- `old` has been assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.
- Depending on the value of `old`, it was either removed from `extra` or removed from `done` and added to `todo`.
- `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`.

The new code line adds `a[r]` to the set `done`.

Thus, the output state will be:
- `r` is incremented by 1 (remains as per the initial state description).
- `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` (remains as per the initial state description).
- The set `extra` may have `old` removed if it was present (remains as per the initial state description).
- The set `done` will now include `a[r]` and may have `old` removed if it was present (remains as per the initial state description).
- The set `todo` will have `a[r]` removed and may have `old` added if it was present in `done` (remains as per the initial state description).

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`. The value `a[r]` is removed from the set `todo` and added to the set `done`.**
