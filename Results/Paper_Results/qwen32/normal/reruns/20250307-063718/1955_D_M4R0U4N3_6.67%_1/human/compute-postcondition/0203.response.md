The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is `a[2]`.

If `old` was in `extra`, it will no longer be present after the removal. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`. `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `m` is less than `n`. `r` is `m + 2`. `old` is `a[2]`. `old` has been removed from `extra`.**
