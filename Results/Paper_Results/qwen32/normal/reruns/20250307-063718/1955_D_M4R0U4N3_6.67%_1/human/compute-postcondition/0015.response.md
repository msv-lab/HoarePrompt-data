Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 1. `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[j]` (regardless of whether `a[0]` was initially in `todo` or not), and `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`.**

Explanation: The `done` set now includes `a[j]`, so it will always contain both `a[0]` and `a[j]` after the execution of the code. The `todo` set remains unchanged in terms of its definition (it still has `a[j]` removed), and `extra` remains unchanged as well.
