To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code for each test case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, `k` are read for each test case.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `todo` is a set of `m` integers.
   - `done` and `extra` are initialized as empty sets.

2. **First `m` Elements**:
   - The first `m` elements of `a` are processed.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is moved to `done`.
   - Otherwise, it is added to `extra`.
   - `ans` is incremented if the size of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Subsequent Elements**:
   - For each element from `m` to `n-1`, the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[r - m]`) is removed from `extra` or `done` and possibly added back to `todo`.
   - The new element (`a[r]`) is processed similarly to the first `m` elements.
   - `ans` is incremented if the size of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all elements, `ans` contains the number of times the size of `done` was at least `k`.

The output state after all iterations is the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Output State Calculation

Given the loop executes `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, the final output state will be a series of `ans` values, one for each test case.

**Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Let's assume we have the following input for simplicity (note that the actual input will be provided during execution, so this is just an example):

- `t = 2`
- First test case: `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `todo = {1, 2}`
- Second test case: `n = 6`, `m = 4`, `k = 3`, `a = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`, `todo = {6, 7, 8}`

**Processing the first test case**:
- Initial `todo = {1, 2}`, `done = set()`, `extra = set()`
- Process first 3 elements: `a[0] = 1` (in `todo`), `a[1] = 2` (in `todo`), `a[2] = 3` (not in `todo`)
  - `todo = set()`, `done = {1, 2}`, `extra = {3}`
  - `ans = 1` (since `len(done) = 2 >= k = 2`)
- Process remaining elements:
  - `a[3] = 4` (not in `todo`), `a[4] = 5` (not in `todo`)
  - `todo = set()`, `done = {1, 2}`, `extra = {3, 4, 5}`
  - `ans = 2` (since `len(done) = 2 >= k = 2`)

**Processing the second test case**:
- Initial `todo = {6, 7, 8}`, `done = set()`, `extra = set()`
- Process first 4 elements: `a[0] = 6` (in `todo`), `a[1] = 7` (in `todo`), `a[2] = 8` (in `todo`), `a[3] = 9` (not in `todo`)
  - `todo = set()`, `done = {6, 7, 8}`, `extra = {9}`
  - `ans = 1` (since `len(done) = 3 >= k = 3`)
- Process remaining elements:
  - `a[4] = 10` (not in `todo`), `a[5] = 11` (not in `todo`)
  - `todo = set()`, `done = {6, 7, 8}`, `extra = {9, 10, 11}`
  - `ans = 2` (since `len(done) = 3 >= k = 3`)

**Final Output State**:
- Output State: **2 2**

This means the final output after all iterations for the given example input would be `2 2`.

However, since the actual input is not provided, the final output state will be the series of `ans` values for each test case, one per line.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, the output state after all iterations is a series of integers, each representing the number of times the size of the `done` set was at least `k` for each respective test case.
