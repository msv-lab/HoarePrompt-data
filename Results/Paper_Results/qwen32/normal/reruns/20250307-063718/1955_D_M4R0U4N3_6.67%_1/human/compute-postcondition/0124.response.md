Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[r]` and any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, `ans` is recalculated; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`; `r` is incremented by 1; `done` now includes `a[r]`.**

In simpler terms, the element `a[r]` has been added to the set `done`. The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, and `old` remain unchanged except for `done`, which now includes the new element `a[r]`.
