Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed except it now contains `old`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially, except it no longer contains `old`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after removing `old`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`.**

In simpler terms, the set `todo` now includes the element `old` that was previously in `done`. All other variables remain unchanged.
