The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`.

Given the initial state:
- `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`, with `a[r]` removed from `todo`.
- `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`.
- `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`.
- If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2.
- `m` is less than `n`.
- `r` is `m + 2`.
- `old` is `a[2]`.

After the execution of `done.add(a[r])`:
- The element `a[r]` is added to the set `done`.
- The length of `done` may increase by 1, which could potentially change the value of `ans` if the new length of `done` is equal to or greater than `k`.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`, with `a[r]` removed from `todo`; `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, and now includes `a[r]`; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; if the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2; `m` is less than `n`; `r` is `m + 2`; `old` is `a[2]`.**
