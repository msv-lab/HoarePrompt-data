Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers that were in `todo` initially or were moved back from `done`; `done` is a set of integers that were in `todo` initially and were moved to `done` or were in `done` initially and not moved; `extra` is a set of integers that were not in `todo` initially and not moved to `done` or were in `extra` initially and not moved; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers after processing elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`; `done` is a set containing elements that have been moved from `todo` to `done` based on the loop's conditions; `extra` is a set containing elements that were not in `todo` and were not moved to `done`; `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `todo` contains elements not processed or moved back to `todo`, `done` contains elements processed and remaining in `done`, `extra` contains elements never in `todo` or moved to `extra`, `ans` is incremented by 1 each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
