Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now removed from `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now added to `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now added to `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`; `r` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `done`, which no longer contains the element `old`. The value of `ans` may change based on the new length of `done` after `old` is removed.
