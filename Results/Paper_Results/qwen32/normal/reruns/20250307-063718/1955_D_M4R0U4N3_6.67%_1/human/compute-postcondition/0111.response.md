The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This means that `extra` will now contain `a[r]` as one of its elements, provided `a[r]` was not already in `extra`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`.
- `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`.
- `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`.
- `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`.
- `a[r]` is not in `todo`.

After the code `extra.add(a[r])` is executed, `extra` will include `a[r]` as an element. The values of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `ans`, `old`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and now includes `a[r]`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
