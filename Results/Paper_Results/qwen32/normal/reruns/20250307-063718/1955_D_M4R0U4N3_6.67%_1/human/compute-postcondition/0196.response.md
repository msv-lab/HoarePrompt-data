The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. Given that `r` is `m + 1`, the element `a[m + 1]` is added to `done`.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]`; `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and now includes `a[m + 1]`; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `m` is less than `n`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]`.**

In simpler terms, the element `a[m + 1]` is now part of the `done` set. The other conditions and states remain unchanged.
