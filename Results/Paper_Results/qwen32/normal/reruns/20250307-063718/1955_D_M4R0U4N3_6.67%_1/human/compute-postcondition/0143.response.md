To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and how the variable `ans` is modified during the execution of the code. The variable `ans` is incremented each time the length of the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `todo` is a set of integers after processing elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`.
- `done` is a set containing elements that have been moved from `todo` to `done` based on the loop's conditions.
- `extra` is a set containing elements that were not in `todo` and were not moved to `done`.
- `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

Without the specific values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the conditions under which `ans` is incremented and what it represents.

The variable `ans` is incremented based on the condition `len(done) >= k`. Therefore, `ans` will represent the number of times during the loop's execution that the set `done` has accumulated at least `k` elements.

Since the exact values and the loop's logic are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its definition and the conditions under which it is incremented.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the length of the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution)**
