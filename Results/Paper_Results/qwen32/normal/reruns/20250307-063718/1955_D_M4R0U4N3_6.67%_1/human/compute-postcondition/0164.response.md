The code snippet adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. This means that the set `done` will now include the value `a[j]` if it was not already present. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged unless directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, `todo` has one less element at the index `a[j]` and subsequent elements are shifted down by one, `done` includes `a[j]`**.
