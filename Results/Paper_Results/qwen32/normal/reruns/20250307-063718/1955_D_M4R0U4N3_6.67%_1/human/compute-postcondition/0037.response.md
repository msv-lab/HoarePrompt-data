Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed, and if `old` was in `done`, it is now in `todo`, except `a[r]` has been removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done`, and now includes `a[r]`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after adding `a[r]` and removing `old` if it was in `done`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is no longer in `todo`.**

In simpler terms, the element `a[r]` has been added to the set `done`. If `old` was previously in `done`, it has been removed. The value of `ans` is updated based on whether the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`. All other conditions and variable values remain as specified in the initial state.
