The code snippet provided initializes a new set called `extra`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, or `done`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `extra` set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set.**
