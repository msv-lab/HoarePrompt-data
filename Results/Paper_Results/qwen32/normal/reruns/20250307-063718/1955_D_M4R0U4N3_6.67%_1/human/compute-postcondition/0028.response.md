The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is an element that was initially in `extra`. After this operation, `extra` will no longer contain `old`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, but `old` has been removed from `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` was in `extra` but is no longer in `extra`.**
