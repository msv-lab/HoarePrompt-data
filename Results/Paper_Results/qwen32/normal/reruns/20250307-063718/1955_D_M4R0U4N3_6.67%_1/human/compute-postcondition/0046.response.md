The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`. This means that after the execution of the code, the set `extra` will no longer contain the element `a[r - m]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` and `n` are still integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`.
- `k` is still an integer.
- `a` is still a list of integers.
- `todo` and `done` sets are still modified as described in the initial state.
- `ans` is still 2 if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 1.
- `old` is still `a[r - m]`.
- `r` is still `r + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed, and if `old` was in `done`, it is now in `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is no longer in `todo` and is now in `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra` but does not contain `a[r - m]`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 1; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`.**
