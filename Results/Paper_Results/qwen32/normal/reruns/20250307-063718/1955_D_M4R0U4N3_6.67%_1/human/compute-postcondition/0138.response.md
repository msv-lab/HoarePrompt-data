The code adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The values of `r`, `old`, `a[r - m]`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are affected as per the initial state description. The values of `a[r]`, `r`, `m`, `a[r - m]`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are not specified, so we will describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`; otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`; `extra` now includes `a[r]`.**

In natural language: After executing the code, `r` has been incremented by 1, `old` holds the value of `a[r - m]`, any previous occurrence of `old` in `extra` is removed, and if `old` was in `done`, it is moved to `todo`. Additionally, the value of `a[r]` is added to the set `extra`.
