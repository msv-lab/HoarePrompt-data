Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The integer `k` satisfies 1 <= k <= m <= n, each element `a_i` in list `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and each element `b_i` in list `b` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
