The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. Given the initial state, `r` has been incremented by 1, and `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. After executing the code, the list `extra` will no longer contain the element that was stored in `old`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; `extra` has `old` removed from it.**
