The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 2. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[j]`, and `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers with `a[0]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**
