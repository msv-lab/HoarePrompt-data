Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The set `todo` will not contain any elements that were originally in `a`.
- The set `done` will contain all the elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`.
- The set `extra` will contain all the elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`.
