The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. This means that `a[r]` will now be included in the set `done`, and if `a[r]` was previously in `todo`, it will be removed from `todo` because `todo` and `done` are mutually exclusive sets.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `done` will now contain `a[r]` in addition to all the elements it previously contained.
- `todo` will no longer contain `a[r]` if it was previously in `todo`.
- The value of `ans` may change based on the new size of `done`. If the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` will be 2; otherwise, it will remain 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with `a[r]` removed and `old` added back if it was in `done`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[r]` and `old` removed if it was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 1; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`.**
