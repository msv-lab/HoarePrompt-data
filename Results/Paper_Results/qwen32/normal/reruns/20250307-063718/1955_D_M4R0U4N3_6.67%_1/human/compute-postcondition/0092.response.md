The code snippet adds the first element of the list `a` (which is `a[j]` where `j` is 0) to the set `done`. This means that `done` will now include `a[0]` if it was not already present.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set that includes `a[0]` along with any previous elements; `extra` is a set that may or may not have been affected based on the presence of `a[0]` in `todo`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is 0**.
