Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 1. `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` or `a[0]` and `a[j]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, and `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`.**

In simpler terms, the integer `t` and integers `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` and the integer `j` also remain unchanged. The set `todo` has `a[j]` removed from it. The set `done` now includes `a[j]` if `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`, or includes both `a[0]` and `a[j]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`. The set `extra` is empty if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, or contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`.
