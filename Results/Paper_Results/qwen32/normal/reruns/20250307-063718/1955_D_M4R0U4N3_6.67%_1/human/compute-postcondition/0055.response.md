Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with `a[r]` removed if it was in `todo` and `old` added back if it was in `done`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo` and `old` removed if it was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`, and `old` removed if it was in `extra`; `ans` is 3 if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) was initially greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is now 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
