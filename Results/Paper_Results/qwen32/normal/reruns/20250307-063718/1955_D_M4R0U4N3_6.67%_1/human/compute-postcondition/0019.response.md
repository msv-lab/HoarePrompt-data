The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so the element `a[2]` is removed from `todo`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `j` is 2.
- The conditions for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are based on whether `a[0]` and `a[2]` are in `todo`.

Since `a[2]` is removed from `todo`, the set `todo` will no longer contain `a[2]`. The sets `done` and `extra` remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 2; `todo` is a set with `a[2]` removed; `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and possibly `a[2]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`.**
