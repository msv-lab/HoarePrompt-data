The code snippet `ans += 1` simply increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `todo` is a set of integers with `a[r]` removed if it was in `todo` and `old` added back if it was in `done`.
- `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo` and `old` removed if it was in `done`, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`.
- `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was in `extra` and now also includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`.
- `ans` is 3 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2.
- `old` is `a[r - m]`.
- `r` is `r + 1`.

After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `ans` was initially 2, it will now be 3. If `ans` was initially 3, it will now be 4.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `old`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with `a[r]` removed if it was in `todo` and `old` added back if it was in `done`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo` and `old` removed if it was in `done`, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was in `extra` and now also includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `ans` is 3 if it was initially 2, or 4 if it was initially 3; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`.**
