Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the state after the code executes. Here's the breakdown:

- `r` is incremented by 1.
- `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.
- If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
- Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`.
- The code snippet then executes `todo.remove(a[r])`.

Let's analyze the changes:

1. `r` has already been incremented by 1 in the initial state.
2. `old` has been assigned the value of `a[r - m]` in the initial state.
3. Depending on the value of `old`, it might have been removed from `extra` or moved from `done` to `todo`.
4. The code snippet then removes `a[r]` from the set `todo`.

Therefore, the value `a[r]` is removed from the set `todo`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`. The value `a[r]` is removed from the set `todo`.**
