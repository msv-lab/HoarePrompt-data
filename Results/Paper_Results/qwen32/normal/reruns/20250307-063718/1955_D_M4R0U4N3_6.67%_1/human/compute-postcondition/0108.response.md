The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. This affects the `todo` set directly. Since `a[r]` was in `todo`, it will no longer be present in `todo` after this operation. No other variables are directly impacted by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `todo` is a set of integers that did not include any elements that were in both `a` and `done`. Since `a[r]` is being removed from `todo`, `todo` will no longer contain `a[r]`.

The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`, and `old` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; m and n are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; k is an integer; a is a list of integers read from the input; todo is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in a and also in todo, and now also excluding a[r]; done is a set containing all elements from a that were in todo; extra is a set containing all elements from a that were not in todo, excluding old if old was in extra; ans is 1 if the length of done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0; old is the value of a[r - m]. If old was in extra, it is removed from extra. If old was in done, it is removed from done and added to todo, and ans is recalculated based on the new length of done. If old was neither in extra nor in done, no changes occur to done, todo, or ans; a[r] is in todo and has been removed from todo.**
