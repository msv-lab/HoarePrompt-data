The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. This affects the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on the initial state provided.

Here's the updated state:

- `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`.
- `done` and `extra` are not directly modified by this operation, but their contents are influenced by the initial state and the removal of `a[r]` from `todo`.

Given that `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, if `a[r]` was in `done`, it would have been added back to `todo` and removed from `done` as part of the initial state description, but since it is now being removed from `todo`, it does not need to be re-added to `done` in this step. The value of `ans` is determined by the length of `done` after modifications, and since `a[r]` was not in `todo` anymore, `ans` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with `a[r]` removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo` and `old` removed if it was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was in `extra`; `ans` is 3 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`.**
