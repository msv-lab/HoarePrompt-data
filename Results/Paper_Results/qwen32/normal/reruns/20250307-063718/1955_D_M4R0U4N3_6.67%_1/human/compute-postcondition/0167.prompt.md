Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a[j]` is not in the list `todo`. If `a[j]` was originally in `todo`, it is now in the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is in the set `extra`. All other conditions from the precondition are retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `j + 1`. If the element `a[j]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` has been added to `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j + 2`, `m` is greater than `j + 1`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element at the index `a[j]` with subsequent elements shifted down by one, and `done` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `extra` contains `a[j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
