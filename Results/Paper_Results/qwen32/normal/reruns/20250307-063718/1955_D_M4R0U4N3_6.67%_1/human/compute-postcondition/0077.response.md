The code snippet `extra = set()` initializes the `extra` variable to be an empty set. This means that any previous contents of `extra` are discarded, and it is now an empty set.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
