The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `j` is `m`, so `a[m]` is added to the set `done`. The sets `todo` and `extra` are not affected by this operation. The variable `ans` counts the number of times the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, but since we only added one element to `done`, `ans` remains unchanged unless the length of `done` becomes greater than or equal to `k` after this addition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo` or `a[m]` if it was not already in `done`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is `m`.**
