Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed, and if `old` was in `done`, it is now in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after removing `old` if it was in `done`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
