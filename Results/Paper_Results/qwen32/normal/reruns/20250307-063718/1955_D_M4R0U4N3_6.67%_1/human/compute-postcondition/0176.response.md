The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. Given the initial state, `old` is `a[0]` and it was not in `todo` before the operation. Therefore, after this operation, `todo` will contain `old` along with its previous elements.

The other variables (`done`, `extra`, `ans`, `m`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the `add` operation on `todo`.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a` including `old`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, and `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is not in `done`.**
