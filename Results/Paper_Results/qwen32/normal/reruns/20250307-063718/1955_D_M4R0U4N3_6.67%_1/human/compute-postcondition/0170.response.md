The code snippet assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Given the initial state, `r` is equal to `m`, so `r - m` equals `0`. Therefore, `old` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.

The values of `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`**.
