The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial integer values. The new variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
