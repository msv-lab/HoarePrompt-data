The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. This means that the set `extra` will now include `a[j]` if it was not already present.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`
- `k` is an integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged
- `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set
- `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set
- `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution
- `j` is `m`

After executing the code snippet `extra.add(a[j])`, the set `extra` will include `a[j]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set, and now `extra` includes `a[m]`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is `m`.**
