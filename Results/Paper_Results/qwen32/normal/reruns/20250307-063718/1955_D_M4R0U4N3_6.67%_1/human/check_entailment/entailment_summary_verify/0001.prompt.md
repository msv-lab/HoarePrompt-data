You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` within the list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in the list `b`. It then prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Objective:** Count the number of subsegments of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.
- **Constraints:** 
  - Multiple test cases.
  - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
  - `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
  - `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`
  - Sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Read the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `todo`: A set of elements from `b` that need to be matched.
   - `done`: A set of elements from the current subsegment of `a` that have been matched with elements in `b`.
   - `extra`: A set of elements from the current subsegment of `a` that do not need to be matched with elements in `b`.

3. **First Subsegment Processing:**
   - For the first `m` elements of `a`, check if they are in `todo`. If yes, move them to `done` and remove them from `todo`. Otherwise, add them to `extra`.
   - Initialize `ans` to 1 if the size of `done` is at least `k`, otherwise set `ans` to 0.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - For each new element added to the subsegment (from `m` to `n-1`):
     - Remove the element that is sliding out of the window (`old = a[r - m]`).
     - If `old` is in `extra`, remove it from `extra`.
     - If `old` is in `done`, remove it from `done` and add it back to `todo`.
     - Add the new element (`a[r]`) to the subsegment.
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, move it to `done` and remove it from `todo`. Otherwise, add it to `extra`.
     - If the size of `done` is at least `k`, increment `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - Print `ans` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Sets vs. Counters:** The program uses sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. This is problematic because sets do not keep track of the frequency of elements. For example, if `b` contains two `1`s and the subsegment of `a` contains one `1`, the program will incorrectly treat it as a match. We need to use `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the frequency of elements.
- **Initialization:** The `todo` set is initialized with elements from `b`. However, since `todo` needs to keep track of the frequency of elements, it should be a `Counter` instead of a set.
- **Updating `todo` and `done`:** When elements are moved from `done` to `todo` or vice versa, the frequency should be updated accordingly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly handle the frequency of elements in `b` and the subsegments of `a`.

### Correctness: **False**
