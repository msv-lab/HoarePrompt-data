Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now in `done` and not in `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra`. `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, and `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done` and is included in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`. `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `m` is less than `n`. `r` is `m + 1`. `old` is `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo`. `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `done` now includes `a[r]`; otherwise, it includes `a[m + 2]`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 4; otherwise, `ans` is 3. `m` is less than `n`. `r` is `m + 2`. `old` is `a[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
