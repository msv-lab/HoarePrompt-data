The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. This means that `a[r]` is now part of the set `done`. Since `a[r]` was previously in `todo` and has been removed from `todo`, we need to update `todo` accordingly. The variable `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done` after adding `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; m and n are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; k is an integer; a is a list of integers read from the input; todo is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in a and also in todo, and now also excluding a[r]; done is a set containing all elements from a that were in todo, plus a[r]; extra is a set containing all elements from a that were not in todo, excluding old if old was in extra; ans is 1 if the length of done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0; old is the value of a[r - m]. If old was in extra, it is removed from extra. If old was in done, it is removed from done and added to todo, and ans is recalculated based on the new length of done. If old was neither in extra nor in done, no changes occur to done, todo, or ans; a[r] is in done and has been removed from todo.**
