The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 again, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`**
