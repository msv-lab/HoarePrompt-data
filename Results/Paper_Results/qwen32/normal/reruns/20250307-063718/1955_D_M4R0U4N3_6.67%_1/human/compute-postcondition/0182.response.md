Postcondition: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`. `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done` and is included in `todo`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
