Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now removed from `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now added to `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now added to `extra`; `ans` is 2 since the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
