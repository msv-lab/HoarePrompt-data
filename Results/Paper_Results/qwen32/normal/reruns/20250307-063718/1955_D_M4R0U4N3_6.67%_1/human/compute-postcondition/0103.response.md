The code snippet `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `done`. 

Given the initial state:
- `old` is an element in `done`
- `old` is not in `extra`
- `ans` is determined by the length of `done` compared to `k`

After executing `done.remove(old)`, the set `done` will have one less element, specifically `old` will no longer be in `done`. This change might affect the value of `ans` if the length of `done` after removal is less than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` except `old`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after removing `old`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`. Additionally, `old` is not in `done`.**
