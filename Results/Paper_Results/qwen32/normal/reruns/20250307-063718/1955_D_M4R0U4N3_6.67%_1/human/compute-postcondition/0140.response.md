The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`r`, `old`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`. If `a[r]` was in the set `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to the set `extra`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
