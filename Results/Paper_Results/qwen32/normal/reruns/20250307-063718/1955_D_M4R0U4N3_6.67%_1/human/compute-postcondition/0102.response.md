Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`. Additionally, `old` is in `done`.**
