The code adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is 0, `a[j]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`; `j` is 0; `a[j]` is not in `todo`**.
