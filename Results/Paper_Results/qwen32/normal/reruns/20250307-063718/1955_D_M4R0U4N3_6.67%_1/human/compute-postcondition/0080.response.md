The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `a[j]` is removed from `todo`, `todo` will no longer contain `a[j]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]`; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**
