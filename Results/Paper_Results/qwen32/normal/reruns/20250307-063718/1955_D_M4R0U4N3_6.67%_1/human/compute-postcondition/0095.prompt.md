Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` or `a[m]` if it was not already in `done`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`. If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `done` remains an empty set and `extra` includes `a[m]`. `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`. If `a[0]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set that includes `a[0]` or `a[m]` if it was not already in `done`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`. If `a[0]` was not in `todo`, `done` remains an empty set and `extra` includes `a[m]`. `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
