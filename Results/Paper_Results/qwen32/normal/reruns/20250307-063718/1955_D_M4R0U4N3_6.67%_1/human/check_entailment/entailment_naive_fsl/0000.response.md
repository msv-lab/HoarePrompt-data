Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the code uses sets to track elements in the subarrays, which can lead to incorrect results because sets do not account for duplicate elements. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3 2
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1
```
Expected output: `3` (since every subarray of length 3 in `a` contains at least 2 elements that match the elements in `b`)

However, the provided code will output `1` because it uses sets, which do not account for the duplicates. In this case, the sets `todo` and `done` will not correctly reflect the number of matching elements due to the lack of counting duplicates.

A correct approach would involve using counters (from the `collections.Counter` module) to keep track of the frequency of elements in the subarrays. This would ensure that the code correctly handles cases with duplicate elements.
