The code snippet assigns the value `1` to `ans` if the length of the `done` set is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it assigns `0` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
