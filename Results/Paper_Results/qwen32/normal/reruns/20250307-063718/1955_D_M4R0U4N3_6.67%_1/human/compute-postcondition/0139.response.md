Postcondition: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`. If `a[r]` was in the set `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to the set `extra`.**
