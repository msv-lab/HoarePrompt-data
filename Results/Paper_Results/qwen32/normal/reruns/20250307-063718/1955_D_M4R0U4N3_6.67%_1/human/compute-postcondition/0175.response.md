Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is not in `done`.**

This means that the element `old` has been removed from the `done` list, and the `ans` value will depend on whether the length of the updated `done` list is still greater than or equal to `k`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
