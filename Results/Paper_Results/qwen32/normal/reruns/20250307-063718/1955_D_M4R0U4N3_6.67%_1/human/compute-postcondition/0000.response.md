The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` mentioned in the state description. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Since `t` is already in the required range, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

However, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 \leq t \leq 10^4`, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for the provided state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
