The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. This affects the `todo` set directly by removing the element and may also affect `ans` if `a[r]` was in the `done` set, as removing it from `todo` could potentially change the length of `done` and thus the value of `ans`.

Here's the updated state:
- `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`.
- If `a[r]` was in `done`, it remains in `done` but `ans` needs to be recalculated since the length of `done` might have changed.

Given the initial state and the code, the new state is:
- `todo` is a set of integers excluding `a[r]` and any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`.
- `done` remains unchanged unless `a[r]` was in `todo`, in which case `ans` is recalculated.
- `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[r]` and any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, `ans` is recalculated; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`; `r` is incremented by 1.**
