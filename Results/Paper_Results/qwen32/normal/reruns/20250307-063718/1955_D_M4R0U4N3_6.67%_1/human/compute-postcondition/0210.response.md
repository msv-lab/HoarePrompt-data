The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Given that `r` is `m + 2`, the element `a[m + 2]` is added to `extra`.

Let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`.
- `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`.
- `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`.
- If `old` was in `extra`, it has been removed from `extra`.
- If `old` was in `done`, it is now in `todo` and removed from `done`.
- `ans` is 3 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2.
- `m` is less than `n`.
- `r` is `m + 2`.
- `old` is `a[2]`.

After executing `extra.add(a[r])`, the set `extra` will definitely include `a[m + 2]`. No other sets (`todo` or `done`) are modified by this statement, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`; `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and now includes `a[m + 2]`; `ans` is 3 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2; `m` is less than `n`; `r` is `m + 2`; `old` is `a[2]`.**
