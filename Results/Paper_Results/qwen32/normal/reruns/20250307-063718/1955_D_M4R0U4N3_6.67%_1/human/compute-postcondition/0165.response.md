The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` indicates that the element at index `j` of the list `a` is being added to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, we know that `j` is `j + 2` (which implies `j` is being incremented by 2 in some prior context, and this is the current value of `j`), and `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.

The output state will reflect that the set `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, `extra` contains `a[j]`**.
