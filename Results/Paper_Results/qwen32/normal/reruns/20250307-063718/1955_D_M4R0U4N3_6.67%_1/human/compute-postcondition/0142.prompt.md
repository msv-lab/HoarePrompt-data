Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where m is greater than 0 and m is less than n; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now removed from `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now added to `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now added to `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo`, and if `a[r]` was in `todo`, `ans` is recalculated and `done` now includes `a[r]`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new length of `done`. If `old` was neither in `extra` nor in `done`, no changes occur to `done`, `todo`, or `ans`; `r` is incremented by 1. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in the set `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in the set `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to the set `todo`. If `a[r]` was in the set `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to the set `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
