The code adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Since `a[j]` is no longer in the list `todo`, it is now included in the set `done`. The other conditions and states from the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[j]` is no longer an element in the list `todo`; `a[j]` is an element in the set `done`; all other conditions from the precondition are retained.**
