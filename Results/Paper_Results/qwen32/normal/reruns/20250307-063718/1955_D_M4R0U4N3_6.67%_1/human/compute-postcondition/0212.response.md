Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, excluding `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, otherwise including `old` if `old` was not in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo`. `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `done` now includes `a[r]`; otherwise, it includes `a[m + 2]`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and `old` has been removed from `extra` if it was there, plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 4; otherwise, `ans` is 3. `m` is less than `n`. `r` is `m + 2`. `old` is `a[2]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
