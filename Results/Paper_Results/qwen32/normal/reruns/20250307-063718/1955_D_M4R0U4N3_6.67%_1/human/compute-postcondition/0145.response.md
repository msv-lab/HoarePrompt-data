The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`) will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers after processing elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`, `done` is a set containing elements that have been moved from `todo` to `done` based on the loop's conditions, `extra` is a set containing elements that were not in `todo` and were not moved to `done`, `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**
