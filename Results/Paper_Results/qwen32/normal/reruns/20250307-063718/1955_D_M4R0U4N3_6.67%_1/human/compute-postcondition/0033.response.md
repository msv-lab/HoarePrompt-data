Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; if `old` was in `done`, then `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially except it now contains `old`, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially except it no longer contains `old`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after removing `old`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; if `old` was not in `done`, then `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`.**
