Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 2. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set with `a[2]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[2]`, and `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set with `a[0]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[1]` and `a[2]` if `extra` initially contained `a[0]` and `a[1]`, or `a[0]` and `a[2]` if `extra` initially contained `a[0]`, or just `a[2]` if `extra` was initially empty. If neither `a[j]` nor `a[0]` is in `todo`, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`.**
