The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variables `t`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers that were in `todo` initially or were moved back from `done`; `done` is a set of integers that were in `todo` initially and were moved to `done` or were in `done` initially and not moved; `extra` is a set of integers that were not in `todo` initially and not moved to `done` or were in `extra` initially and not moved; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
