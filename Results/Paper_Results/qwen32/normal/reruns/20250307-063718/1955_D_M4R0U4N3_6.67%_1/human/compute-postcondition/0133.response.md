The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. The value of `r` being incremented by 1, `old` being assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, and `old` being removed from the set `done` are all part of the initial state and do not change due to this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `old` is now an element of the set `todo`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; `old` is removed from the set `done`; `old` is added to the set `todo`.**
