Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now in `done` and not in `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra`. `ans` is 2 since the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, and `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done` and is included in `todo`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables retain their initial states and relationships.
