The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`a[j]` is not in the list `todo`. If `a[j]` was originally in `todo`, it is now in the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is in the set `extra`. All other conditions from the precondition are retained, `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, to be more precise, if `j` was the last valid index in the previous iteration, the loop should not execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented but still less than `m`.

State: **`a[j]` is not in the list `todo`. If `a[j]` was originally in `todo`, it is now in the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is in the set `extra`. All other conditions from the precondition are retained, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` must be less than `m`**.

To make it clear, let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_old`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 1`.

State: **`a[j_old]` is not in the list `todo`. If `a[j_old]` was originally in `todo`, it is now in the set `done`. Otherwise, `a[j_old]` is in the set `extra`. All other conditions from the precondition are retained, `j` is `j_old + 1`, and `j` must be less than `m`**.

Since we are asked to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we simplify it to:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`**
