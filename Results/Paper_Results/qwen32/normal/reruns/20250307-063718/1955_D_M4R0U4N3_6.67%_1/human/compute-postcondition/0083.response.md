The code snippet adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. This means that `extra` will now contain `a[j]` as one of its elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `a[j]` is not in `todo`**.
