The provided code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers read from the input, splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. This means the previous list stored in `a` is overwritten by the new input list.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers after processing elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`, `done` is a set containing elements that have been moved from `todo` to `done` based on the loop's conditions, `extra` is a set containing elements that were not in `todo` and were not moved to `done`, `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**
