The code snippet adds `a[r]` to the `extra` set. This means that `extra` now includes `a[r]` in addition to its previous elements. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the `todo`, `done`, `ans`, `m`, `n`, and `old` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra` and now also contains `a[r]`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`.**
