The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This means that if `a[r]` was not already in `extra`, it will now be included. The sets `todo` and `done` are not affected by this operation, nor are the variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `old`, or `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially removed, and if `old` was in `done`, it is now in `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is no longer in `todo` and is now in `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now in `done`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is no longer in `done` and is now in `todo`. `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` (after the appropriate modifications) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 1; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `r` is `r + 1`; `a[r]` is now in `extra`.**
