Output State: **`todo` contains elements not processed from `a`, `done` contains elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` and `old` itself if `old` was in `done`, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is still greater than or equal to `k` after removing `old`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`.**

In simpler terms, the element `old` (which is `a[1]`) has been removed from `done`. The values of `todo`, `extra`, `m`, `n`, `r`, and `old` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is recalculated based on whether the length of `done` is still greater than or equal to `k` after removing `old`.
