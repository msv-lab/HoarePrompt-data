The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Given that the initial state is `j` is `j + 1`, it implies that `j` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.

Thus, the element `a[j]` is added to the set `extra`. The value of `j` remains `j + 1` as no further changes are made to `j` in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `extra` contains the element `a[j]`**.
