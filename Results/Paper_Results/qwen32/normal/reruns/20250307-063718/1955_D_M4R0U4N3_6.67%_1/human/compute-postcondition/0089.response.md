Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` and `n` are integers where `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is less than `n`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` or `a[m]` if it was not already in `done`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`. If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `done` remains an empty set and `extra` includes `a[m]`. `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `j` is `m`.**
