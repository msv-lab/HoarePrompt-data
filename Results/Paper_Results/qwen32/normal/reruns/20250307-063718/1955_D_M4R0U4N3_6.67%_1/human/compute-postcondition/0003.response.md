The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. This set is assigned to the variable `todo`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values as described in the initial state. The new variable `todo` is a set of integers that were read from the input.
