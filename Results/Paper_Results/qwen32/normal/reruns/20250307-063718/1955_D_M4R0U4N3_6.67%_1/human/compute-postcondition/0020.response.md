The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `a[j]` is `a[2]`.

Since `done` already contains `a[0]` and possibly `a[2]`, adding `a[2]` to `done` will not change `done` if `a[2]` is already in it. If `a[2]` was not in `done`, it will now be added, making `done` contain both `a[0]` and `a[2]`.

The sets `todo` and `extra` are not affected by this operation. The integer variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `j` is 2; `todo` is a set with `a[2]` removed; `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[2]`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo` or a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`.**
