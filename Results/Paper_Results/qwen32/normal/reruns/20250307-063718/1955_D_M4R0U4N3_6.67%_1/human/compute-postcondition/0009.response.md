The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, so the element `a[0]` is added to `done`. The set `todo` had `a[j]` removed, so `a[0]` is no longer in `todo`. The sets `done` and `extra` were initially empty, and `done` now contains `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `m` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of integers with `a[0]` removed; `done` is a set containing `a[0]`; `extra` is an empty set; `j` is 0.**
