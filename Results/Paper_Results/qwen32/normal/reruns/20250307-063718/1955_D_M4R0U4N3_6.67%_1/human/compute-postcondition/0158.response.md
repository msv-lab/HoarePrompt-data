The code snippet removes the element at index `a[j]` from the list `todo`. Given the initial state, `j` is `j + 1`, which indicates that `j` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the element at index `a[j]` (where `j` is the incremented value) is removed from `todo`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; the element at index `a[j]` has been removed from `todo`.**
