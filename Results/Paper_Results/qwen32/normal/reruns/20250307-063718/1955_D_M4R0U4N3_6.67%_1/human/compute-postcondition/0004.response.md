The given code snippet initializes a new set named `done`. This set is initially empty and does not affect the values of the other variables provided in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `todo` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `todo` is a set of integers read from the input; `done` is an empty set.**
