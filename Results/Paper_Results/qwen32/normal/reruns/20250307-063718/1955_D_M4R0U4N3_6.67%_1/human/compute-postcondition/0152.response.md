The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the list `todo`. This means that the list `todo` will have one less element after the execution of this line.

Output State: **`a[j]` is no longer an element in the list `todo`; all other conditions from the precondition are retained.**

In simpler terms, the element `a[j]` has been removed from the list `todo`, and everything else remains the same as before.
