The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the range of `len(l)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The list `l` remains unchanged throughout the loop, so there is no need to adjust it.

State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**
