The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `a[i]` is defined as `prod // a[i]`, we need to consider this in the output state. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `prod` or `a[i]` other than the relationship `a[i] = prod // a[i]`. Therefore, we can only express the change in `sumo` in terms of `a[i]`.

The other conditions (`i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`.**
