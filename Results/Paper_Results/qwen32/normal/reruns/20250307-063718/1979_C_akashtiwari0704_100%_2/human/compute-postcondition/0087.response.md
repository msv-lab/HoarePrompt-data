The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The initial state specifies that `l` has at least one element and `i` is 1. Therefore, `l[i]` is the second element of the list `l`. The value of `g` is modified based on this calculation, but the values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is 1, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`**.
