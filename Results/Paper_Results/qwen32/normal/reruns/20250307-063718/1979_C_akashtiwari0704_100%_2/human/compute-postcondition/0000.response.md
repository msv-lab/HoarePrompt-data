The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will be assigned the specific integer value provided by the input, while the conditions on `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
