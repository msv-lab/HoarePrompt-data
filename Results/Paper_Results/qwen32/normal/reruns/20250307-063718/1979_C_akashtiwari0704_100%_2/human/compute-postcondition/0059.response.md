The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is already an integer, so the `int()` conversion does not change its value. The value of `sumo` is updated to be its previous value plus `a[i]`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from input with `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` has at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`.**
