The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The values of `prod`, `bets`, `a`, `sumo`, and the condition that `sumo` is less than `prod` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**
