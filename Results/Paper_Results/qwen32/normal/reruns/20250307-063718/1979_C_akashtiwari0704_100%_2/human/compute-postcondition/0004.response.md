Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `g` is updated to the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The list `l` remains unchanged and still has at least one element.
