Postcondition: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial `a`. `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`. `bets`, `l`, `g`, `T`, and `prod` remain unchanged. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes occur. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `bets` must be greater than 0 with `i` set to `bets - 1`.**
