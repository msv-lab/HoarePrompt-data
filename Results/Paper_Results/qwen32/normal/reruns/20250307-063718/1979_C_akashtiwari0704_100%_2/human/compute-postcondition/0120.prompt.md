Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function remains in this state. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the modified values of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space, and all other variables (`prod`, `bets`, `a`, `sumo`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a new list of integers read from input with `a[len(l) - 1]` modified to `prod // a[len(l) - 1]`, `bets` is the number of iterations, `l` has at least one element, `i` is either `len(l) - 1` if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, or `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[len(l) - 1])`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 0 and `ans` is a string containing the string representation of all elements in `a` separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial `a`. `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`. `bets`, `l`, `g`, `T`, and `prod` remain unchanged. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes occur. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `bets` must be greater than 0 with `i` set to `bets - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
