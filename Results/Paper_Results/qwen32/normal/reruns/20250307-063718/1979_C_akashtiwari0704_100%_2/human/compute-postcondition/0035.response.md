The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is `bets - 1`, the element `a[i]` is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the string `ans` will now include the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space, in addition to whatever it previously contained.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `bets - 1` and `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space.**
