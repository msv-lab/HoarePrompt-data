`bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` is an input integer, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, and `T` is `len(l) + 1`.**
