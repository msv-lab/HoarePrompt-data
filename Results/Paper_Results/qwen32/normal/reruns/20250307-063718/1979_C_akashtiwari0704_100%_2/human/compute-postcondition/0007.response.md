The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \)
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
- `l` is a list with at least one element
- `i` is `i + 1`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `l` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

So, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 2`**
