The value of `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` and `i` is `i + 1`. The precondition that `bets` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`**.

This means that `sumo` has been updated to include the integer value of `a[i]`, while the other conditions and values remain as specified.
