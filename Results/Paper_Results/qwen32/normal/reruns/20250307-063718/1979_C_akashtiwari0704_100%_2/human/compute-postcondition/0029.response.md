Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `prod` is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the original list `a`.
2. `bets` remains unchanged.
3. The first `bets` elements of the list `a` are modified to `prod // a[i]`.
4. `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`.
5. `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(-1)` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `prod`, `bets`, `a`, or `sumo`. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
