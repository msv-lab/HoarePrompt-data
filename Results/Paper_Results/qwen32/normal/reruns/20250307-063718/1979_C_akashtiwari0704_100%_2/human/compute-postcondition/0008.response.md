The code snippet updates the value of `g` using the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The values of `t`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `g` is recalculated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 2`**

In simple terms, the value of `g` is recalculated using the new formula provided, while `t`, `l`, and `i` retain their initial values.
