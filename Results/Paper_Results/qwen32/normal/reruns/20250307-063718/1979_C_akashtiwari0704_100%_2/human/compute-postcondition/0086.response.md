The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` has at least one element.
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `l` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

So, if `i` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 2 at the start of the next iteration, and so on.

State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make it more concrete, if we assume `i` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is 1**.

If `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is 2**.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we can generalize it as:
State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, if we need a specific example, let's assume `i` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration:
State: **`l` has at least one element, `i` is 1**.
