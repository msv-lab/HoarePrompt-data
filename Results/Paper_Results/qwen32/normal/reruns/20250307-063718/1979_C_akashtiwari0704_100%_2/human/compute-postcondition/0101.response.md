The code snippet provided increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is defined as `prod // a[i]`, which implies that `a[i]` has been updated to this value before the current line of code is executed. 

Therefore, the value of `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, which is `prod // a[i]`.

The values of `bets`, `i`, and `a[i]` remain as per their initial state description, except that `sumo` is updated.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[i]`.**
