Output State: **The function accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. `bets` is an input integer. `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

In simple terms, the list `a` is now populated with integers from the input, while the function's purpose and the variable `bets` remain unchanged.
