The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Since `i` is equal to `bets` and `bets` is incremented by 1 after this operation, the value of `ans` will now include the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `bets`, `bets` is `bets + 1`, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space.**
