To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `T` and `t`. The variable `T` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, and `t` is the number of iterations, which is given as an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given the loop:
```python
for T in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t`.

The state before the loop starts does not need to include `n` or `k` because they are not part of the loop head. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \)**
