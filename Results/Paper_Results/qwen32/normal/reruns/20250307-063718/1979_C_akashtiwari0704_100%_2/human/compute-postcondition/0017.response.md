The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sumo` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `prod`, `bets`, or `a`. Therefore, the value of `sumo` is now 0 while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of all the elements in the list `a`; `bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `sumo` is 0.**
