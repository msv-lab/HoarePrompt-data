You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function remains in this state. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the modified values of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space, and all other variables (`prod`, `bets`, `a`, `sumo`) remain unchanged. `T` is incremented by 1
    g = 1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        
    #State: `prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, and `T` is `len(l) + 1`.
    return g
        def lcm(l):
        #Overall this is what the function does: The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns `g`, which is the Least Common Multiple of all elements in `l`.
    #The program returns `g` which is the LCM of all elements in `l`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `g` which is the LCM of all elements in `l`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
