The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the variable `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, and this value is added to `sumo`. The other variables (`bets`, the other elements of `a`, and `prod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `sumo` is incremented by `int(a[i])`; all other elements of `a` and `prod` remain unchanged.**
