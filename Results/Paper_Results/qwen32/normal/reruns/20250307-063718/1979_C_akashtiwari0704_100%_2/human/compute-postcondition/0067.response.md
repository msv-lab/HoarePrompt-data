Postcondition: **`a` is a new list of integers read from input with `a[len(l) - 1]` modified to `prod // a[len(l) - 1]`, `bets` is the number of iterations, `l` has at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[len(l) - 1])`, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
