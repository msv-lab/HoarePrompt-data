The code snippet sets `sumo` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `l` has at least one element, `i` is either `len(l) - 1` if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, or `bets - 1` if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 2`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0.**
