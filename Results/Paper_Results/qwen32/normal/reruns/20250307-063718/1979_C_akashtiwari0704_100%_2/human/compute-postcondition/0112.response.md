The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is an empty string. After the execution of the code, `ans` will contain the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial `a`; `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`; `bets`, `l`, `g`, `T`, `prod` remain unchanged; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i]) + ' '`; `bets` must be greater than 0.**
