To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and updates the variable `g` using the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \)
- `g` is 1

And the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

The loop will execute `len(l)` times, where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(l) - 1`. After each iteration, the value of `g` is updated based on the current element of the list.

After all iterations, the final value of `g` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list `l`. This is because the formula `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` is a standard way to compute the LCM of a list of numbers iteratively.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \)
- `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list `l`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is the LCM of all elements in the list `l`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `t` remains the same integer that was initially provided, and `g` is the least common multiple of all the numbers in the list `l`.
