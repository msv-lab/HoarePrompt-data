The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the variable `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` where `prod` is the Least Common Multiple of all the elements in the list `a`. The value of `sumo` was initially 0.

After executing the code, `sumo` will be updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`, which simplifies to `0 + int(a[i])` or simply `int(a[i])`.

The other variables (`prod`, `bets`, and `a`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of all the elements in the list `a`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `int(a[i])`.**
