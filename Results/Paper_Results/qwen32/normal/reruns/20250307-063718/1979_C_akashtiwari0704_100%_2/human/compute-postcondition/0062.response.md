The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to the current value of `sumo`. Given the initial state, `sumo` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from input with `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than `len(l)`, `l` has at least one element, `i` is `len(l)`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `sumo` is now the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
