Output State: **`l` has at least one element; `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**

In this output state, the list `l` retains its property of having at least one element. The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `gcd(g, l[i])` is the greatest common divisor of `g` and the element at index `i` in the list `l`.
