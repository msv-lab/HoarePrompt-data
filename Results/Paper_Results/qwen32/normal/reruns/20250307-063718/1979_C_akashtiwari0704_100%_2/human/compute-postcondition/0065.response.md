The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to the current value of `sumo`. Given that `a[i]` is already an integer (since `a` is a list of integers), the `int()` conversion does not change the value of `a[i]`.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `sumo` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`.

The other variables (`a`, `bets`, `l`, `i`, `g`, `T`, `prod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from input with `a[i]` modified to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than `len(l)`, `l` has at least one element, `i` is `len(l) + 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`.**
