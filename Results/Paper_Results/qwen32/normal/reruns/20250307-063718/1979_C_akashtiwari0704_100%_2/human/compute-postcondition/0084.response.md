The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last element that was processed, and `g` is updated based on the current element `l[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `l`.

Given that `l` has at least one element, the loop will start with `i` being 0, and it will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `l`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`l` has at least one element, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1**
