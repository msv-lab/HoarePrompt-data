Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from input, `bets` is an input integer, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `T` is `len(l) + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sumo` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
