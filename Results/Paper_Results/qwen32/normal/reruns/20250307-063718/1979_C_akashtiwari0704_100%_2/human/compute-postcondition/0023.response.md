The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was initially set to `int(a[i])`. After the execution of the code, `sumo` will be the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`.

Since `a[i]` is already an integer, `int(a[i])` is simply `a[i]`. Therefore, `sumo` will be updated to `int(a[i]) + a[i]`, which is `2 * a[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of all the elements in the list `a`, `bets` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `2 * a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
