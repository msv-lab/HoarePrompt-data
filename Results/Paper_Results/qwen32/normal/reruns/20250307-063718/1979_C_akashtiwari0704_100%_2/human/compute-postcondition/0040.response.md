Postcondition: **`prod` is the Least Common Multiple of the original list `a`, `bets` remains unchanged, `a` has its first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function remains in this state. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the modified values of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space, and all other variables (`prod`, `bets`, `a`, `sumo`) remain unchanged.**
