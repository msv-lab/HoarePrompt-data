The `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement is independent of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state. The initial state describes the transformation of the list `a`, the calculation of `sumo`, and the conditions involving `bets`, `l`, `g`, `T`, and `prod`. However, these do not influence the execution of the `print` statement.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply output the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **-1**
