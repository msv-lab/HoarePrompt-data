The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of the list `l`. Since the length of the list `l` does not change during the iteration, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has just completed its execution for that `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `t` and `g` are updated within the loop but are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 1 \), `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**.
