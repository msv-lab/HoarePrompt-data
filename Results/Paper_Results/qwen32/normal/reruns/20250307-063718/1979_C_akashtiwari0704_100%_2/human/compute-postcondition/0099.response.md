The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index that was just processed, and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `sumo` is incremented by `int(a[i])`; all other elements of `a` and `prod` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we only adjust the objects in the loop head, the final state we need to specify is:
State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
