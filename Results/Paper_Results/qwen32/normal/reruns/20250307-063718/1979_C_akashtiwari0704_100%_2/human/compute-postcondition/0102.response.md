Let's analyze the given information step by step.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`
- `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[i]`

For loop statement:
```python
for i in range(bets):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Adjustments:

- `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 1` (since it was incremented at the end of the previous iteration).
- `bets` must be greater than the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

### Final State:

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is `i + 1`. Therefore, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
