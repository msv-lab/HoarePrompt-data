The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` from the initial `a`; `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`; `bets`, `l`, `g`, `T`, `prod` remain unchanged; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` up to the current value of `i`; `bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the string `ans` now includes the string representation of the current element `a[i]` followed by a space, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
