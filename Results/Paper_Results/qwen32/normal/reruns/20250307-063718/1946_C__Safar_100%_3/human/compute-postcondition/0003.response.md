Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, and stack is [(1, 1)]. `visited` is an empty set. `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`. `r` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for the new variable `r`, which is assigned the value `0`.
