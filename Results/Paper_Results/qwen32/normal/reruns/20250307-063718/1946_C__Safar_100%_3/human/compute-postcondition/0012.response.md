Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is either `[(1, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` depending on whether `node` is not equal to `p`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1 and `x` is in `visited`, `p` is 1. If `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` is updated to `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`.**
