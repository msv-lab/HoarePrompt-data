Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`, otherwise `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`. `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1 and `x` is in `visited`, `p` is 1, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]`.**
