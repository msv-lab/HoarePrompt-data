Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is [], `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1`, `r` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1. The condition `x == 1` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, then `r` is 1. Otherwise, `d[x]` is 2 and `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `visited` initially contains the value `1`, and after executing `visited.remove(x)`, `visited` becomes an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged.
