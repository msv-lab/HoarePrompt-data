Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, where 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function returns a result based on these inputs, which is not further specified in the given output description.**
