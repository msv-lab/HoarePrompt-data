Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, and stack is [(1, 1)]. `visited` is {1}. `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`. `r` is 0. `x` is 1 and `x` is in `visited`. `p` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: A is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is either `[(1, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` depending on whether `node` is not equal to `p`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1 and `x` is in `visited`, `p` is 1. If `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` is updated to `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]`, otherwise `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`. `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1 and `x` is in `visited`, `p` is 1, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1), (node, x)]` if `node != p`, otherwise `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, and `p` is 1, and `node` is the second element in `g[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
