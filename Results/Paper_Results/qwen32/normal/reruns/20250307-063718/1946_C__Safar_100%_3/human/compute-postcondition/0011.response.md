The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` adds a tuple `(node, x)` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state, the value of `node` is not explicitly provided, but we know that `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree where g[1] has at least one element, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, stack is [(1, 1), (node, 1)], visited is {1}, d is a dictionary with the key 1 and the value 1, r is 0, x is 1 and x is in visited, p is 1, node is not equal to p.**

In natural language: The `stack` now contains two tuples: `(1, 1)` and `(node, 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
