Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, and stack is [(1, 1)]. `visited` is an empty set. `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`. `r` is 0. `x` is 1. `p` is 1. Additionally, `x` is in `visited`**
