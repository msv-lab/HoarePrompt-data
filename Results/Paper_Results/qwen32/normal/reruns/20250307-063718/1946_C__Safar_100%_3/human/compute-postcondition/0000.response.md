Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree (where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices), k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, and stack is [(1, 1)].**

In this output state, the variables `A`, `g`, and `k` retain their initial values. A new variable `stack` is introduced and initialized with the tuple `(1, 1)`.
