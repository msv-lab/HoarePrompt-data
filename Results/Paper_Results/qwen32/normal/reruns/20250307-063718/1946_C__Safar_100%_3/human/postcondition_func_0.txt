The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (where 1 <= k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge between two vertices in the tree. It calculates and prints the maximum value `r` for which a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) holds true.
