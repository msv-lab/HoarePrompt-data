To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple \((a, b)\) represents an edge between vertices \(a\) and \(b\) in the tree.
- `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `l` is initialized to `r + 1`.
- `r` is the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`.

The variable `r` is described as the maximum value for which a function `check(mid)` was `True`. However, the function `check(mid)` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `r`. Nonetheless, we know that `r` is a specific integer value determined by the `check(mid)` function during some previous part of the code.

Given this information, the output of the `print(r)` statement will be the value of `r`, which is the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`.

Output: **r (where r is the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`)**
