The code snippet provided extracts the last tuple from the `stack` and assigns its first element to `x` and its second element to `p`. Given that the `stack` is initialized as `[(1, 1)]`, the values of `x` and `p` will both be `1`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code has been executed:

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, and stack is [(1, 1)]. `visited` is an empty set. `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`. `r` is 0. `x` is 1. `p` is 1.**
