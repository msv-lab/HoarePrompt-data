You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is `r + 1`, `r` is the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, where 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function returns a result based on these inputs, which is not further specified in the given output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
