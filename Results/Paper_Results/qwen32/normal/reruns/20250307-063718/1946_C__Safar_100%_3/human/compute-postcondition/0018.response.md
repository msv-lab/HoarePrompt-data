Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` has at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1), (node, x)]` if `node != p`, otherwise `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, and `p` is 1, and `node` is the second element in `g[1]`.**
