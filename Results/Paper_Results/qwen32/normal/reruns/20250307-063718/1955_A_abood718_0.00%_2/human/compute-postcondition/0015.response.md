The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

This statement will print the product of the integers `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A * B`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
