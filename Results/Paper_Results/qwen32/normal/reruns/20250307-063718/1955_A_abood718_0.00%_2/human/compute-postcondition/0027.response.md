To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this specific print).
4. `X` is calculated as `A // 2` (integer division of `A` by 2).

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(X)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which is the integer division of `A` by 2. This means `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
- Since the exact value of `A` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `X`. However, we know that `X` is computed based on the value of `A`.

### Output:
The `print(X)` statement will print the value of `X`, which is the result of the integer division of `A` by 2.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division of A by 2)**
