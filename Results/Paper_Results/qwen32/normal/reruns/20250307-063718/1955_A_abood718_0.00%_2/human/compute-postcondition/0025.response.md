To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

The value of `t` does not affect the output of the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task. The values of `A` and `C` are the critical elements here.

The expression `int(A * C / 2)` calculates the product of `A` and `C`, divides the result by 2, and then converts the result to an integer. The value of `B` is not used in the expression, so we can ignore it as well.

Given that `A` and `C` are integers, the expression `A * C / 2` will first compute the product of `A` and `C`, resulting in a real number if the division by 2 does not result in an integer. The `int()` function then truncates the decimal part, effectively performing integer division.

Therefore, the output will be the integer part of the division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
