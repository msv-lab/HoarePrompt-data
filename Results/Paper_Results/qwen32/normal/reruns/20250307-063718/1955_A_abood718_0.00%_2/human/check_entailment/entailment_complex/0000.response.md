### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided Python program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program uses the following logic to determine the minimum cost:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them under promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
     - If `n` is even, buying yogurts in pairs under promotion is generally cheaper (or equal). The total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost for `n-1` yogurts (which is even) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt. The total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Evaluation of the Logic:**
   - The first condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if a * 2 <= b` to check if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper or equal to the promotion price. The current condition will incorrectly suggest buying individually when the promotion price is the same as buying two individually.
   - The second condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is correct for calculating the cost when `n` is even.
   - The third condition handles the case when `n` is odd. However, the print statement `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect because it prints an intermediate value instead of the final result. The correct calculation is `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Logic:
- The corrected logic should be:
  - If `a * 2 <= b`, print `n * a`.
  - Else if `n` is even, print `(n // 2) * b`.
  - Else (if `n` is odd), print `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect condition `if B * 2 < C` and the unnecessary print statement in the third condition, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
