To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(X * C + B)`, we need to analyze the given initial state and calculate the value of the expression step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
3. `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
4. `A` is an odd integer.
5. `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

### Calculating the Output:
- `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will be the integer part of `A / 2`, which means `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`. For example, if `A` is 5, then `X` will be 2.
- The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`.
- Since `X` is `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Explanation of the Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`, where:
- `A // 2` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- `C` is an integer.
- `B` is an integer.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, C is an integer, and B is an integer such that B * 2 >= C)**
