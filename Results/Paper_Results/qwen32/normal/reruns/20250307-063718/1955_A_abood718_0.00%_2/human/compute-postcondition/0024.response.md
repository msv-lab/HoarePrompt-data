Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. The value of `C` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `i` is incremented by 1. However, `i` is not used in the provided code snippet.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

Since `A` and `B` are integers read from the input, the expression `A * B` will compute the product of these two integers. However, the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided in the initial state, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A * B`.

Based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
