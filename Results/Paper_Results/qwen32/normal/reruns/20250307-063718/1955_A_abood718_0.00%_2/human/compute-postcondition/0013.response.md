The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer input value, which is `t` in this context.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `i` is the current loop counter. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. If `B * 2 < C`, the value of `B` remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C`, the value of `A` remains unchanged if `A` is even. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`. `i` is incremented by 1**
