The value of `X` is assigned the result of `A // 2`, which is the integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `t`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value is not specified, we only note that it has been incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `X` is `A // 2`.**
