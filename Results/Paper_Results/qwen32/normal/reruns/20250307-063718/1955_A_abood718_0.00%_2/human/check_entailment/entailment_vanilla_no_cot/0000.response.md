Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in how it handles the calculation of the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the else block where it handles the case when `A` (number of yogurts) is odd, is incorrect. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- If `B * 2 < C`, it correctly calculates the cost as `A * B` since buying yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them in pairs.
- If `A` is even, it correctly calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C`, as it can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
- However, if `A` is odd, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then tries to calculate the cost as `X * C + B`. The first `print(X)` should be removed, and the correct calculation should be `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                print(X * C + B)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version handles all cases correctly, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated for buying `n` yogurts.
