Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. Let's analyze the logic of the program to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - If `b * 2 < a`: This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually. If true, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `n * a`, which does not account for the promotion. The correct approach would be to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and handle any remaining yogurt separately.
   - If `n % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the number of yogurts is even. If true, the program correctly calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`, because all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - If `n % 2 != 0`: This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd. The program calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a`, which buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The first condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if b <= 2 * a` to check if the promotion price is beneficial. If `b` is less than or equal to `2 * a`, it is beneficial to use the promotion. The program should then calculate the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and handling any remaining yogurt separately.
   - The program incorrectly prints the value of `X` in the last condition, which is unnecessary and disrupts the expected output format.

Given these issues, the program does not always compute the minimum cost correctly. Specifically, the first condition is flawed, and the unnecessary print statement in the last condition disrupts the output format.

Correctness: **False**
