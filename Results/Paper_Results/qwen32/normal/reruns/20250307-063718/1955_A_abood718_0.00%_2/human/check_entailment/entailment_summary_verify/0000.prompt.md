You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a specific result based on the conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, there is an issue with the logic in the last `else` block. The code is printing the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then attempting to calculate the cost, but it is not correctly calculating the cost when `A` is odd.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```
The `print(X)` statement is unnecessary and incorrect. The program should directly compute and print the cost without printing intermediate values. When `A` is odd, the cost should be calculated as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price, and `B` is the price for the remaining single yogurt.

Here is a corrected version of the problematic part:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    Y = A % 2
    print(X * C + Y * B)
```
In this corrected version, `Y` is the number of single yogurts bought at the regular price, which is `A % 2`. The total cost is then `X * C + Y * B`.

Let's verify the corrected logic with the provided examples:

1. For `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - `X = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 2 % 2 = 0`
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 0 * 5 = 9`

2. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - `X = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14`

3. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - `X = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost = `1 * 11 + 1 * 5 = 16` (Note: The problem states the cost should be 15, which means `b` should be used for two yogurts and `a` for the third, but the code correctly calculates the minimum cost as 15)

4. For `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - `X = 4 // 2 = 2`
   - `Y = 4 % 2 = 0`
   - Cost = `2 * 11 + 0 * 5 = 22` (Note: The problem states the cost should be 20, which means `b` should be used for two pairs, but the code correctly calculates the minimum cost as 20)

The original code incorrectly prints `X` and does not correctly handle the cost calculation when `A` is odd. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
