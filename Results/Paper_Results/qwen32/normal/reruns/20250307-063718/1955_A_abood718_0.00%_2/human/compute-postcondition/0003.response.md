Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `B` is such that `B * 2` is less than `C`.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(A * B)`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical result for `A * B`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

The `print(A * B)` statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
