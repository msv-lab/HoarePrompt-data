To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
   - `i` is incremented by 1. However, `i` is not used in the provided code snippet.
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which is integer division of `A` by 2.

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`.

3. **Substitute `X` with its Definition:**
   - Since `X` is `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression to be printed is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

5. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Given that the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
