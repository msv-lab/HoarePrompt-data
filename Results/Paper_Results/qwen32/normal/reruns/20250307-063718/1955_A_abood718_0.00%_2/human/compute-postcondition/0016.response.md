Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

To understand what will be printed, we need to analyze the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.

1. **Multiplication**: The expression first computes the product of `A` and `C`, which results in an integer value (assuming `A` and `C` are integers, as given in the initial state).
2. **Division**: The product is then divided by 2. Since the division is done using the `/` operator, it would normally result in a floating-point number.
3. **Conversion to Integer**: The `int()` function is applied to the result of the division, which truncates the decimal part and converts the result to an integer.

Thus, the expression `int(A * C / 2)` computes the integer part of half the product of `A` and `C`.

Given the initial state does not specify the exact values of `A` and `C`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
