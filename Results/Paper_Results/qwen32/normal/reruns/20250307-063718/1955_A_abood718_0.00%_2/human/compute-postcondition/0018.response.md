Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. However, these variables are also not used in the print statement.
- `X` is `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The print statement is:
```
print(X)
```

Since `X` is defined as `A // 2`, the value of `X` will be the integer division of the value of `A` by 2. The exact value of `X` depends on the value of `A`.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division of A by 2)**

However, if we want to provide a more precise output based on the information given, we can state that `X` is the result of `A // 2`, without needing the specific value of `A`.

So, the final formatted output is:
Output: **X (where X is A // 2)**
