t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, a, b) such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30. Each tuple represents a test case with n as the number of yogurts, a as the price for one yogurt, and b as the price for two yogurts on promotion.
