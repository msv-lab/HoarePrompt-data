The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `t` and `i`. The conditions and operations described in the initial state are not applied in this snippet, as they come after the input reading.

Thus, the only change is that `A`, `B`, and `C` are now assigned the values read from the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**

However, since the increment of `i` is mentioned in the initial state but not in the provided code snippet, the correct output state should reflect only the changes made by the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.**
