### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts during promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - **Condition 1**: If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them under promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - **Condition 2**: If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, each costing `b`. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - **Condition 3**: If `n` is odd, Maxim should buy `(n // 2)` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` and one yogurt at the regular price `a`. Therefore, the total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The execution summary indicates that the program prints `A * B` if `B * 2 < C`, `A * C / 2` if `A` is even, and `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2` if `A` is odd.
   - However, there is a mistake in the execution summary: the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before printing the final cost `X * C + B`. This print statement for `X` should not be there.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for calculating the minimum cost is correct, but there is an extraneous print statement that outputs `X` (which is `A // 2`) before the final cost. This extraneous print statement makes the program incorrect based on the problem's output requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
