### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Conditions**:
  - If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts together.
  - If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`.
- For each test case, it prints a specific result based on the conditions:
  - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`.
  - If `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Condition `B * 2 < C`**:
   - This condition checks if buying two yogurts together is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - If true, the cost is `A * B`, which is incorrect. It should be calculated as `(A // 2) * C + (A % 2) * B` to account for the remaining yogurt if `A` is odd.

2. **Condition `A % 2 == 0`**:
   - This condition checks if the number of yogurts is even.
   - If true, the cost is `A * C / 2`, which is also incorrect. It should be `X * C` where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Else Condition**:
   - This condition handles the case when the number of yogurts is odd.
   - The code prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then `X * C + B`.
   - The print statement `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The correct calculation should be `X * C + (A % 2) * B`.

#### Corrected Code:
The correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
```

#### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect `print(X)` statement in the `else` block. Additionally, the cost calculation in the `if` block is incorrect. The corrected version should handle the cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
