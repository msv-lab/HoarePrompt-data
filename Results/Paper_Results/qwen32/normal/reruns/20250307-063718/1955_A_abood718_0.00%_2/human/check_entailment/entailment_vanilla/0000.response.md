Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts, and there are two pricing options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations
- If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts together.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. For each test case, read the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. Determine the cost based on the number of yogurts and the prices:
   - If `b < 2 * a`, calculate the cost considering the promotion.
   - If `b >= 2 * a`, calculate the cost by buying all yogurts individually.

### Detailed Steps
- If `b < 2 * a`:
  - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`).
  - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts (`n % 2`).
  - The total cost is `number_of_pairs * b + remaining_yogurts * a`.
- If `b >= 2 * a`:
  - The total cost is simply `n * a`.

### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```
- The code correctly checks if `b < 2 * a` and calculates the cost accordingly.
- However, there is an issue in the `else` block:
  - The line `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect.
  - The correct calculation should be `X * C + B` for the case when `n` is odd, but it should be `X * C + (A % 2) * B` to correctly handle the remaining yogurt.

### Corrected Code
The correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
```

### Conclusion
The original code is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect `print(X)` statement in the `else` block. The corrected version should handle the cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
