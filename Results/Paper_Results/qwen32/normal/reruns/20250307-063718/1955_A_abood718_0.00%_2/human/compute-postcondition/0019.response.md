Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine `X`**: 
   - `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. This means `X` is the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
2. **Calculate the Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `X * C + B`.
   - Since `X` is `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
