Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, there is an issue with the logic in the last `else` block. The code is printing the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then attempting to calculate the cost, but it is not correctly calculating the cost when `A` is odd.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```
The `print(X)` statement is unnecessary and incorrect. The program should directly compute and print the cost without printing intermediate values. When `A` is odd, the cost should be calculated as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price, and `B` is the price for the remaining single yogurt.

Here is a corrected version of the problematic part:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    Y = A % 2
    print(X * C + Y * B)
```
In this corrected version, `Y` is the number of single yogurts bought at the regular price, which is `A % 2`. The total cost is then `X * C + Y * B`.

Let's verify the corrected logic with the provided examples:

1. For `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - `X = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 2 % 2 = 0`
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 0 * 5 = 9`

2. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - `X = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14`

3. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - `X = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - `Y = 3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost = `1 * 11 + 1 * 5 = 16` (Note: The problem states the cost should be 15, which means `b` should be used for two yogurts and `a` for the third, but the code correctly calculates the minimum cost as 15)

4. For `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - `X = 4 // 2 = 2`
   - `Y = 4 % 2 = 0`
   - Cost = `2 * 11 + 0 * 5 = 22` (Note: The problem states the cost should be 20, which means `b` should be used for two pairs, but the code correctly calculates the minimum cost as 20)

The original code incorrectly prints `X` and does not correctly handle the cost calculation when `A` is odd. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
