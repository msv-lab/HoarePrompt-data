The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a specific result based on the conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`.
