### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to evaluate its correctness:

#### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts with the goal of minimizing the cost. There are two pricing options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The strategy involves:
- If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts together.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

#### Detailed Steps
1. **If `b < 2 * a`:**
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`).
   - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts (`n % 2`).
   - The total cost is `number_of_pairs * b + remaining_yogurts * a`.

2. **If `b >= 2 * a`:**
   - The total cost is simply `n * a`.

#### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

- **Condition `if B * 2 < C`:**
  - This condition checks if the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
  - The code correctly prints `A * B`, which is incorrect. It should be `X * C + remaining * B` where `X = A // 2` and `remaining = A % 2`.

- **Condition `elif A % 2 == 0`:**
  - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
  - The code correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs.

- **Condition `else`:**
  - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd.
  - The code incorrectly prints `X` and then `X * C + B`.
  - The correct calculation should be `X * C + B` for the pairs and `B` for the remaining yogurt, i.e., `X * C + (A % 2) * B`.

### Corrected Code
The correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
        else:
            print(A * B)
```

### Conclusion
The original code is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect `print(X)` statement in the `else` block and the incorrect handling of the `if B * 2 < C` condition.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
