To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the conditions and the provided initial and intermediate states. 

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` are read from the input. The loop then checks three conditions and prints values based on these conditions:

1. If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
2. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
3. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` and then `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`.

The output state after the loop completes would include the following:
- The loop variable `i` will have completed all `t` iterations, so `i` will be equal to `t`.
- For each iteration, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will have been read from the input and processed according to the conditions above.
- The specific printed values will depend on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each iteration.

Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables affected by the loop, we can summarize the final state as follows:

Output State: **The loop variable `i` will be equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` iterations, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will have been read and processed, leading to specific printed outputs based on the conditions provided.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations are complete, the loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `t`, and the program will have printed the appropriate values for each set of `A`, `B`, and `C` based on the given conditions.
