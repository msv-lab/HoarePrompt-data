The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the value of `i` before this operation is not specified, we can only note that it has been incremented. The variables `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are affected, while `i` is incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
