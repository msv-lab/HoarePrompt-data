### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts with two possible pricing options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

#### Key Observations
- If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts together.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

#### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. For each test case, read the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. Determine the cost based on the number of yogurts and the prices:
   - If `b < 2 * a`, calculate the cost considering the promotion.
   - If `b >= 2 * a`, calculate the cost by buying all yogurts individually.

#### Detailed Steps
- If `b < 2 * a`:
  - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`).
  - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts (`n % 2`).
  - The total cost is `number_of_pairs * b + remaining_yogurts * a`.
- If `b >= 2 * a`:
  - The total cost is simply `n * a`.

### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `A`, `B`, and `C` are read and processed.
- The program checks conditions and prints the appropriate result.

#### Issues in the Code
- **Condition `B * 2 < C`**:
  - If `b < 2 * a`, the program prints `A * B`, which is incorrect. It should calculate the cost considering the promotion.
  - Correct calculation: `X = A // 2` (number of pairs), `remaining = A % 2` (remaining yogurts), `total_cost = X * C + remaining * B`.
  
- **Condition `A % 2 == 0`**:
  - If `n` is even, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is correct for the promotion price.

- **Else Block**:
  - The program prints `X` (number of pairs) and then `X * C + B`.
  - This is incorrect because it does not account for the remaining yogurt when `n` is odd.
  - Correct calculation: `X = A // 2` (number of pairs), `remaining = A % 2` (remaining yogurts), `total_cost = X * C + remaining * B`.

### Corrected Code
The corrected code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(X * C + remaining * B)
```

### Conclusion
The original code is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the `B * 2 < C` condition and the unnecessary and incorrect `print(X)` statement in the `else` block. The corrected version should handle the cases correctly.

**Final: False**
