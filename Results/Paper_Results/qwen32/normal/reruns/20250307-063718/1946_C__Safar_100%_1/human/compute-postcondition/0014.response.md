The provided code snippet appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. Given the initial state, `node` is the second element in `g[1]`, and `x` is `1`. Therefore, the `stack` will now contain the initial tuple `[(1, 1)]` plus the newly added tuple `(node, 1)`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices where `g[1]` must have at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` contains `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, `node` is the second element in `g[1]`.**
