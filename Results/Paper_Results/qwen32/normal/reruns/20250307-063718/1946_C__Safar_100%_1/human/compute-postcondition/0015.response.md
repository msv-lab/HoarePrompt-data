Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices where `g[1]` must have at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`. If `node != p`, then `stack` contains `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`, otherwise `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`. `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the second element in `g[1]`.**
