Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, which is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, with the constraint that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which could be a description of the resulting forest or a specific value related to the modified tree structure.**
