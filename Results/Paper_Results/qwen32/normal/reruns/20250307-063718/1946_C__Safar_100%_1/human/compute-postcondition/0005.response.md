The code `x, p = stack[-1]` takes the last element of the `stack` list, which is `(1, 1)`, and unpacks it into the variables `x` and `p`. Therefore, `x` is assigned the value `1` and `p` is also assigned the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack contains [(1, 1)]; visited is an empty set; d is {1: 1}; r is 0; x is 1; p is 1**.
