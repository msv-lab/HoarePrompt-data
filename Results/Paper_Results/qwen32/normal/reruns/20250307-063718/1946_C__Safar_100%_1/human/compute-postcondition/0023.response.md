Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack contains [(1, 1)]; visited is a set that includes the integer 1; d is {1: 1}; r is 0; x is 1; p is 1; x is in visited. If the current value of x is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
