The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` adds a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state, `node` is the third element in `g[1]` and `x` is `1`. Therefore, the tuple `(node, 1)` is appended to `stack`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices where `g[1]` must have at least three elements, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` contains `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]` if `node != p`, otherwise `stack` contains `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the third element in `g[1]`.**
