Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices where `g[1]` must have at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` contains `[(1, 1)]` if `node == p`, otherwise `stack` contains `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`. Additionally, if `node` is not equal to `p`, `node` is added to the stack with its distance `x`.**
