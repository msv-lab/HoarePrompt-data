Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack is empty; visited is a set that includes the integer 1; x is 1; p is 1; x is in visited; if d[x] (which is d[1]) is greater than or equal to A, then r is 1; otherwise, r is 0 and d[x] is 2. If the current value of x is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `stack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the stack, which was `(1, 1)`. Therefore, the stack becomes empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
