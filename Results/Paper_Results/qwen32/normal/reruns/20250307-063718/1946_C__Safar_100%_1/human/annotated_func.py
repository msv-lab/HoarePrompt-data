#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. `g` is a list of lists with a length of `n + 1`, where each list at index `a` contains all vertices `b` such that there is an edge between vertex `a` and vertex `b`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: - `n`, `k`, `edges`, and `g` remain unchanged.
    #   - `c` remains 0.
    #   - `l` will be `r + 1`.
    #   - `r` will be the maximum value for which `check(mid)` was `True`.
    #
    #Given the nature of the binary search, the final value of `r` will be the largest integer for which `check(mid)` holds true. The value of `l` will be one more than this value because the loop exits when `l` becomes greater than `r`.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the largest integer for which check(mid) was True during the binary search)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed (with the constraint 1 <= k < n); and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree. It performs a binary search to determine the largest integer `r` for which a certain condition `check(mid)` holds true and prints this value `r`.
