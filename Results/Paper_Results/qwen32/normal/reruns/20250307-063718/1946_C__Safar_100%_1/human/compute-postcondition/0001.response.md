Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack contains [(1, 1)]; visited is an empty set.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `visited` is initialized as an empty set, while all other variables retain their initial values.
