The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed (with the constraint 1 <= k < n); and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree. It performs a binary search to determine the largest integer `r` for which a certain condition `check(mid)` holds true and prints this value `r`.
