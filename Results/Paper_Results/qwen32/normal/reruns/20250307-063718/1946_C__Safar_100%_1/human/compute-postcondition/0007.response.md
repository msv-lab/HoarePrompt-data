Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack contains [(1, 1)]; visited is {1}; d is {1: 1}; r is 0; x is 1; p is 1; x is in visited**

In this output state, the variable `visited` has been updated to include the value `1`, indicating that the node `1` has been visited. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
