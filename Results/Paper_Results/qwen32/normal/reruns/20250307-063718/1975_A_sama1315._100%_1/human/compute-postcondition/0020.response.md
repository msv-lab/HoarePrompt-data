The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
