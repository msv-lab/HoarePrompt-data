Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `a` is the last list of integers processed.
   - `data` remains unchanged (its exact value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `idx` is calculated as `1 + sum(n_i for i in range(t)) + t`, where `t` is `0`.
   - `t` is `0`.
   - `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(a)` for each corresponding `a`.

2. **Calculation of `idx`:**
   - Since `t` is `0`, `idx` simplifies to `1 + sum(n_i for i in range(0)) + 0`, which is `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`.

3. **Understanding `results`:**
   - `results` is a list of `t` elements. Since `t` is `0`, `results` is an empty list `[]`.

4. **The print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('\n'.join(results))`.
   - Since `results` is an empty list, `'\n'.join(results)` will return an empty string.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
