Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them). Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a sorted version of itself (`sorted_a`) by performing the described operation.
   - It creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself. This allows us to check all possible rotations of the array `a` within the range of its length.
   - It then iterates through all possible starting points in `concatenated_a` and checks if a slice of length `n` (the length of `a`) starting from that point matches `sorted_a`.
   - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. If no match is found after checking all possible slices, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program handles all edge cases, including arrays that are already sorted, arrays that cannot be sorted by any number of operations, and arrays that can be sorted by one or more operations. The logic is sound and covers all potential scenarios described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output is `Correctness: **True**`.
