The code snippet provided is `result = func_1(a)`. This line of code means that the variable `result` is being reassigned to the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `a`.

Initial State: 
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input
- `idx` is `3 + 2n`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`

After the execution of `result = func_1(a)`, the variable `result` will hold the value returned by `func_1(a)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
