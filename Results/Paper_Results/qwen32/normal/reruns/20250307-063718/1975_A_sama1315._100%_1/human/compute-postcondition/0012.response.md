The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, which is not further defined in the provided context, so we can only say that `results` now contains this value.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
