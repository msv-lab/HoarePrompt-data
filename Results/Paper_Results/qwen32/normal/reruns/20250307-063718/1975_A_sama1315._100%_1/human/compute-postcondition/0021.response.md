The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, and `n` is initially the integer value of `data[2 + n]`. After executing the code, the value of `n` changes to the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
