You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each integer in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: the loop completes without returning 'Yes'.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers with length `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each integer in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if such a subsequence exists, otherwise it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where 2 <= n <= 50, and each integer in a is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `a` is the last list of integers processed, `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `1 + sum(n_i for i in range(t)) + t`, `t` is `0`, and `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(a)` for each corresponding `a`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (an empty string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it computes a result using another function `func_1` with a list of integers. It then prints the results of these computations, each on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps.
   - A prefix-suffix swap involves splitting the array into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapping their positions.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, then there must exist a point in the array where the sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the doubled version of the array. This is because the operation is equivalent to rotating the array.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and checks if the sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the doubled version of the array.
   - The function `func_1` performs this check by creating a concatenated version of the array (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and then checking if any contiguous subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted version of the array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

4. **Verification of the Approach:**
   - The approach is correct because it leverages the property of the prefix-suffix swap operation, which is equivalent to rotating the array. By checking the doubled array, we ensure that any valid rotation is considered.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and directly addresses the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - It correctly processes arrays of varying lengths.
   - It checks for the presence of the sorted subarray in the doubled array, which covers all possible rotations.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
