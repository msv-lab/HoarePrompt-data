The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
