To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps.
   - A prefix-suffix swap involves splitting the array into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapping their positions.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, then there must exist a point in the array where the sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the doubled version of the array. This is because the operation is equivalent to rotating the array.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and checks if the sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the doubled version of the array.
   - The function `func_1` performs this check by creating a concatenated version of the array (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and then checking if any contiguous subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted version of the array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

4. **Verification of the Approach:**
   - The approach is correct because it leverages the property of the prefix-suffix swap operation, which is equivalent to rotating the array. By checking the doubled array, we ensure that any valid rotation is considered.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and directly addresses the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - It correctly processes arrays of varying lengths.
   - It checks for the presence of the sorted subarray in the doubled array, which covers all possible rotations.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
