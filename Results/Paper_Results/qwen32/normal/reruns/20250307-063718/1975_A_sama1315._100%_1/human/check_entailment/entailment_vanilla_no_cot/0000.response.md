To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it matches the requirements.

The task is to check if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and these parts are swapped. The key observation is that if we concatenate the array with itself, any possible rotation of the array (which is equivalent to splitting and swapping parts) will appear as a contiguous subarray within this concatenated array.

Here is the breakdown of the provided solution:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - **Input**: An array `a`.
   - **Process**:
     - Determine the length `n` of the array `a`.
     - Create a sorted version of `a` called `sorted_a`.
     - Concatenate `a` with itself, resulting in `concatenated_a`.
     - Check if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
   - **Output**: Returns 'Yes' if a match is found, otherwise 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input**: Reads input from standard input.
   - **Process**:
     - Parses the input to get the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads the length `n` of the array and the array elements.
     - Calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check for any rotation of the array that would result in a sorted array. If such a rotation exists, the function will return 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

Therefore, the provided program is correct according to the problem description.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
