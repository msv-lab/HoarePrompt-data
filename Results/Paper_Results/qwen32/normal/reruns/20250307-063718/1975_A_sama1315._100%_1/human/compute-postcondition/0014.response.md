The code snippet provided is `n = int(data[idx])`. Given the initial state, `idx` is `2 + n`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. When this line of code is executed, `n` is reassigned the value of `int(data[idx])`.

Here is the step-by-step impact:
1. `idx` is initially `2 + n`.
2. `n` is reassigned to `int(data[idx])`.

Since `idx` is `2 + n` and `n` is initially `int(data[1])`, after the code execution, `n` will be updated to the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
