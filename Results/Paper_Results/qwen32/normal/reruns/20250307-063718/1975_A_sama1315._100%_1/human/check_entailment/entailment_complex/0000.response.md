### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key insight is that if we concatenate the array with itself, any valid rotation of the array will appear as a contiguous subsequence of this concatenated array. If any such subsequence is sorted, then the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

Let's break down the provided functions:
1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - It does this by sorting the original array `a` and then checking every possible subsequence of length `n` in `a + a`.
   - If any such subsequence matches the sorted version of `a`, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.
   - If no such subsequence is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles reading input for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints all results, one per line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the provided code with the example given in the problem:

**Input:**
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

**Processing:**
- For the first test case (`[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`):
  - The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
  - The doubled array is `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
  - No subsequence of length 6 in the doubled array matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'No'.

- For the second test case (`[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`):
  - The sorted version is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
  - The doubled array is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.
  - The subsequence starting at index 2 (`[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`) matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

- For the third test case (`[1, 2, 3]`):
  - The sorted version is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The doubled array is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - The subsequence starting at index 0 (`[1, 2, 3]`) matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

**Output:**
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

This matches the expected output, confirming that the functions work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
