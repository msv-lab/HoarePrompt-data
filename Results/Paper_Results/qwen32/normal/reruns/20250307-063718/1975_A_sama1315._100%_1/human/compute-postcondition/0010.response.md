The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
