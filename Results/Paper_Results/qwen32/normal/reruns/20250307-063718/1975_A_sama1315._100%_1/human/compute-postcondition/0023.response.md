The code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the substring of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers. Given the initial state, `idx` is `3 + 2n + 1` and `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`. Therefore, `a` will be updated to a list of integers derived from `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 2n + 1 + n]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 2n + 1 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
