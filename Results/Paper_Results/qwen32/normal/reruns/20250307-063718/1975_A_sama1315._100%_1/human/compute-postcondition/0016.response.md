The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` updates the list `a` by mapping the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers. This means `a` will now contain the integers derived from the strings in `data` starting from index `idx` and spanning `n` elements.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input
- `idx` is `3 + n`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`

After the execution of the code snippet, the new value of `a` will be derived from `data` starting at index `idx` (which is `3 + n`) and will span `n` elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
