The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `n`. Given that `idx` is 1, `n` will be the integer value of the string at index 1 in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer in `a` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
