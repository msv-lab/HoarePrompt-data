The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
