The code reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list of substrings is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of positive integers, but the code does not modify `a` directly. Instead, it creates a new list `data` from the input.

Given that the input is expected to be a sequence of positive integers separated by spaces, after the execution of the code, `data` will be a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where 2 <= n <= 50, and each integer in a is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input.**
