### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and these two parts are swapped. The key insight here is that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order if and only if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted.

The provided program implements this logic in the `func_1` function. Here's how it works:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any rotation of the array within the concatenated array.
2. **Checking Rotations**: The program iterates over the possible starting points of a rotation within the concatenated array. For each starting point, it checks if the subarray of length `n` starting from that point is equal to the sorted version of the original array.
3. **Returning Result**: If a sorted version of the array is found as a subarray within the concatenated array, the function returns "Yes". If no such subarray is found after checking all possible rotations, the function returns "No".

The `func_2` function handles input reading and output formatting, calling `func_1` for each test case and collecting the results.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Concatenated: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - None of the subarrays of length 6 within the concatenated array match the sorted array, so the function returns "No".

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - Concatenated: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` starting at index 2 matches the sorted array, so the function returns "Yes".

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Concatenated: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` starting at index 0 matches the sorted array, so the function returns "Yes".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It checks all possible rotations of the array efficiently by leveraging the concatenated array.

**Correctness: True**
