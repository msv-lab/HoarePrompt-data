Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer in `a` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
