Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer in `a` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
