### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting the array into a prefix and suffix and swapping them. The key insight is that the array can be sorted by rotations if and only if there exists a contiguous subsequence in the doubled array that is sorted and has the same length as the original array.

- **Function `func_1(a)`**:
  - This function takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` (the length of `a`) in the doubled array `a + a` is sorted in ascending order.
  - If such a subsequence exists, it implies that the array can be rotated to become sorted, and the function returns `'Yes'`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
  - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by rotations.
  - It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct because checking for a sorted subsequence of length `n` in the doubled array `a + a` effectively checks if the array can be rotated to become sorted.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases by using `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
