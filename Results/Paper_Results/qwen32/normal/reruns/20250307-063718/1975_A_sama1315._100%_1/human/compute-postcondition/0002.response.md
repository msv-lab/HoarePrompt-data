The code snippet provided initializes a variable `idx` to 0. The lists `a` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer in `a` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is 0.**
