Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 2n + 1 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by `n`, changing from `3 + 2n + 1` to `3 + 3n + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
