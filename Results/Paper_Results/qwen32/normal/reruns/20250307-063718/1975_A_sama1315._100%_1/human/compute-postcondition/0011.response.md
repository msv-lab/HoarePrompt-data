To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet `result = func_1(a)` on the existing variables. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we will assume that `func_1` processes the list `a` and returns a result, which is then stored in the variable `result`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n` are defined as follows:
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input.
- `idx` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.

After executing `result = func_1(a)`, the variable `result` will hold the value returned by `func_1(a)`. The other variables (`a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
