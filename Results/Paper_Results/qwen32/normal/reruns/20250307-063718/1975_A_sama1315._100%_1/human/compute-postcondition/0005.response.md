The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t`). Therefore, the output state remains the same for `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t`, except for the newly introduced `results` list which is empty.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer in `a` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
