The code snippet provided appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now contain the original `result` value followed by the new `result` value.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

In simple terms, the `results` list now has two elements, both of which are the same and equal to `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
