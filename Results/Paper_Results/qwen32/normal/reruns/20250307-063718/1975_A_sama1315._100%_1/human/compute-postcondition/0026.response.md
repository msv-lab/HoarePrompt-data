Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 2n + 1 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing three values, the first two of which are the value of `result` and the third is also the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

Natural language description: The variable `results` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the value of `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
