### Reasoning:

The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps.
   - A prefix-suffix swap involves splitting the array into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapping their positions.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The insight that the sorted version of the array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the doubled version of the array is correct. This is because any rotation of the array can be represented as a subarray in the doubled array.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, processes each test case by reading the array, and uses `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps.
   - `func_1` doubles the array (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and checks if any contiguous subarray of length `n` matches the sorted version of the array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

4. **Verification of the Approach:**
   - The approach is correct because it leverages the property of the prefix-suffix swap operation, which is equivalent to rotating the array. By checking the doubled array, we ensure that any valid rotation is considered.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and directly addresses the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - It correctly processes arrays of varying lengths.
   - It checks for the presence of the sorted subarray in the doubled array, which covers all possible rotations.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` is accurate. It correctly describes that the function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
