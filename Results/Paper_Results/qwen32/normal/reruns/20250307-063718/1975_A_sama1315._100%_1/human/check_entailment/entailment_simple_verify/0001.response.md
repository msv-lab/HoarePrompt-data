### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and its annotations to ensure that it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps. A prefix-suffix swap involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping their positions.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
   - The program concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`).
   - It then checks if any contiguous subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) in the concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array (`sorted_a`).

2. **Logic Explanation**:
   - By concatenating the array with itself, the program effectively considers all possible rotations of the array. This is because any rotation of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array.
   - If a sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array, it means the array can be rotated to become sorted.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and checks for the presence of the sorted subarray in the concatenated array.
   - The annotations also indicate that the program returns 'Yes' if such a subarray is found and 'No' otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - It processes arrays of varying lengths.
   - It correctly checks for the presence of the sorted subarray in the doubled array, covering all possible rotations.

#### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
  - Concatenated: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - The sorted array is not a contiguous subarray of the concatenated array.
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Program Output: `No`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
  - Concatenated: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - The sorted array is a contiguous subarray of the concatenated array.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Program Output: `Yes`

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Concatenated: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
  - The sorted array is a contiguous subarray of the concatenated array.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Program Output: `Yes`

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by leveraging the property of the prefix-suffix swap operation, which is equivalent to rotating the array. The annotations validate the program's behavior, and the program correctly handles the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
