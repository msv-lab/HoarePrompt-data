The code snippet provided updates the variable `result` by assigning it the value returned by the function `func_1(a)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `result` after the function call. However, we can say that `result` will now hold the value returned by `func_1(a)`.

The other variables (`a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers derived from `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 2n + 1 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input; `idx` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing two values, both of which are the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
