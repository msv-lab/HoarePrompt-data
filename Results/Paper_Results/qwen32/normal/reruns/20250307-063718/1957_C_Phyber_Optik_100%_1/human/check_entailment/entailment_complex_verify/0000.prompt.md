You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and `dp[i]` is computed for all i from 6 to n using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the value of `dp[n]` where `dp` is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function accepts an integer `n` as input, which represents the index up to which the sequence is computed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description.

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, but it is not clear why this specific size is chosen. The problem states that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, so the `dp` array should be initialized with a size of at least 3 * 10^5 + 1 to accommodate all possible values of `n`.

2. **Function `func_1` call**: The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000, which initializes the `dp` array up to index 300000. However, if `n` is greater than 300000, the program will not have the correct precomputed values in the `dp` array and will result in incorrect answers.

3. **Handling of `invalid` set**: The `invalid` set is used to store the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set for each move. This is incorrect because `r` and `c` represent different dimensions (row and column), and they should be tracked separately. The code should maintain two separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.

4. **Calculation of `invalid` count**: The code calculates the number of invalid positions by taking the length of the `invalid` set. This is incorrect because it counts both rows and columns together, which can lead to an overestimate of the number of invalid positions.

5. **Final configuration calculation**: The code calculates the number of final configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the fact that the computer can skip its turn if `r == c`. The code should correctly account for the number of available rows and columns separately, and then calculate the number of valid configurations based on these counts.

To fix the program, the following changes should be made:

- Initialize the `dp` array with a size of at least 3 * 10^5 + 1.
- Call `func_1` with an argument that is at least as large as the maximum possible value of `n`.
- Maintain separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.
- Calculate the number of invalid positions separately for rows and columns.
- Correctly calculate the number of final configurations based on the number of available rows and columns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
MOD = 1000000007
MAX_N = 300005
dp = [-1 for _ in range(MAX_N)]

def func_1(n):
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD

func_1(MAX_N - 1)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    invalid_rows = set()
    invalid_cols = set()
    for _ in range(k):
        (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
        invalid_rows.add(r)
        invalid_cols.add(c)
    
    available_rows = n - len(invalid_rows)
    available_cols = n - len(invalid_cols)
    
    if available_rows == 0 or available_cols == 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        result = (dp[available_rows] * dp[available_cols]) % MOD
        print(result)
```

This corrected version initializes the `dp` array with a size of 300005, correctly initializes the `dp` values, maintains separate sets for rows and columns, and calculates the number of final configurations correctly.
