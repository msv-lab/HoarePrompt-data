Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description.

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, but it is not clear why this specific size is chosen. The problem states that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, so the `dp` array should be initialized with a size of at least 3 * 10^5 + 1 to accommodate all possible values of `n`.

2. **Function `func_1` call**: The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000, which initializes the `dp` array up to index 300000. However, if `n` is greater than 300000, the program will not have the correct precomputed values in the `dp` array and will result in incorrect answers.

3. **Handling of `invalid` set**: The `invalid` set is used to store the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set for each move. This is incorrect because `r` and `c` represent different dimensions (row and column), and they should be tracked separately. The code should maintain two separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.

4. **Calculation of `invalid` count**: The code calculates the number of invalid positions by taking the length of the `invalid` set. This is incorrect because it counts both rows and columns together, which can lead to an overestimate of the number of invalid positions.

5. **Final configuration calculation**: The code calculates the number of final configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the fact that the computer can skip its turn if `r == c`. The code should correctly account for the number of available rows and columns separately, and then calculate the number of valid configurations based on these counts.

To fix the program, the following changes should be made:

- Initialize the `dp` array with a size of at least 3 * 10^5 + 1.
- Call `func_1` with an argument that is at least as large as the maximum possible value of `n`.
- Maintain separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.
- Calculate the number of invalid positions separately for rows and columns.
- Correctly calculate the number of final configurations based on the number of available rows and columns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
MOD = 1000000007
MAX_N = 300005
dp = [-1 for _ in range(MAX_N)]

def func_1(n):
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD

func_1(MAX_N - 1)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    invalid_rows = set()
    invalid_cols = set()
    for _ in range(k):
        (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
        invalid_rows.add(r)
        invalid_cols.add(c)
    
    available_rows = n - len(invalid_rows)
    available_cols = n - len(invalid_cols)
    
    if available_rows == 0 or available_cols == 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        result = (dp[available_rows] * dp[available_cols]) % MOD
        print(result)
```

This corrected version initializes the `dp` array with a size of 300005, correctly initializes the `dp` values, maintains separate sets for rows and columns, and calculates the number of final configurations correctly.
