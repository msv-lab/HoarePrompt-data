To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `dp` array. The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n`, updating the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. 

Given the initial conditions and the first three iterations, we can continue this process until `i = n`. The loop updates `dp[i]` using the formula:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \]

Let's continue the iterations from the known state after 3 iterations:

- **Iteration 4**: `dp[4]` is already given as 25.
- **Iteration 5**: `dp[5]` is already given as 81.

Now, let's calculate `dp[6]` as an example:
\[ dp[6] = (dp[5] + 2 \times (6 - 1) \times dp[4]) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 2 \times 5 \times 25) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 250) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \]

Continuing this process up to `dp[n]`, we would calculate each `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `n`. However, since the problem requires the final state and not the intermediate states, we can generalize that the loop will continue to compute `dp[i]` for all `i` up to `n` using the provided formula.

Thus, after all iterations, the `dp` array will have been fully computed up to `dp[n]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves `r_i`, `c_i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and `dp[i]` is computed for all i from 6 to n using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the final state of the `dp` array after all iterations of the loop, with all other variables remaining as they were initially described.
