#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and `dp[i]` is computed for all i from 6 to n using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the value of `dp[n]` where `dp` is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function accepts an integer `n` as input, which represents the index up to which the sequence is computed.
