### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem involves a game where rooks are placed on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - Moves are mirrored, except when a move is on the diagonal (\( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations of the board after all valid moves are made.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Initialization and Input Handling**:
     - The program sets a recursion limit and initializes a DP array `dp` to store the number of configurations for different board sizes.
     - It calls `func_1` to fill the DP array.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
     - For each move, it adds the row and column to a set `invalid` to keep track of positions that are already occupied.

   - **Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1`)**:
     - This function fills the `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations for an \( i \times i \) board.
     - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - For larger board sizes, the recurrence relation is used: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

   - **Configuration Counting**:
     - For each test case, the program calculates the number of valid positions left on the board by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
     - It then prints `dp[n - len(invalid)]` as the number of possible configurations, ensuring it is at least 1.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, including the initialization of the DP array and the computation of the DP values using the given recurrence relation.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **DP Recurrence**: The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the number of configurations for an \( i \times i \) board. This relation needs to be verified to ensure it correctly models the problem.
   - **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are plausible. A 1x1 board has only one configuration, and a 2x2 board can have 3 valid configurations.
   - **Handling of Invalid Positions**: The program correctly identifies and excludes invalid positions from the count of valid configurations.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The results are correctly taken modulo \(10^9+7\).

5. **Verification of the Recurrence Relation**:
   - The recurrence relation appears to be derived from the combinatorial nature of placing rooks on the board. However, without a formal proof or derivation, we can rely on the provided test cases to verify the correctness.
   - The provided test cases match the expected output, suggesting that the recurrence relation is correct for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and the provided recurrence relation and base cases seem reasonable given the problem constraints. The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, and the provided test cases match the expected output, suggesting that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
