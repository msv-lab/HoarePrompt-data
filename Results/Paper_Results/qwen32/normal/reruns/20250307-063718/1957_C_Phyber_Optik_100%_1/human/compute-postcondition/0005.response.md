The code snippet calculates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of the `dp` array. Given the initial state, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, and `i` is 4. The formula provided is:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 \times (4 - 1) \times dp[2]) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[4] = (7 + 2 \times 3 \times 3) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[4] = (7 + 18) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[4] = 25 \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[4] = 25 \]

The value of `dp[4]` is 25, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 4**.
