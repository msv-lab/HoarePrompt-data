### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, with the constraint that no two rooks can attack each other. The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for different board sizes and then uses these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization (`func_1` function):**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are defined as `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board).
   - For larger board sizes, the function uses a recursive formula to compute the number of configurations: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula considers all possible placements of rooks on the board, taking into account the mirroring rule and ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves, updating a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of remaining valid rows and columns is calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program then uses the precomputed `dp` values to determine the number of possible final configurations for the remaining board size, ensuring the result is printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Correctness of the Dynamic Programming Formula:**
   - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board. It considers:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which is equivalent to solving the problem for an \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board (`dp[i-1]`).
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column and then mirroring it, which involves choosing one of the \( i-1 \) columns and solving the problem for an \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board (`2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no moves have been made (`k = 0`), in which case the number of configurations is `dp[n]`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the board is fully occupied (`len(invalid) = n`), in which case there are no more valid moves, and the number of configurations is 1 (the current configuration).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and it efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
