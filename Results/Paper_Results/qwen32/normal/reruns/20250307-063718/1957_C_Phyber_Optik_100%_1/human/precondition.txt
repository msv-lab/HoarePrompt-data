t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. Additionally, for each of the k lines in a test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, representing valid moves on the chessboard.
