### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the number of valid final configurations of the chessboard after `k` initial moves and subsequent mirrored moves by the computer. The core of the solution involves precomputing a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[n]` represents the number of valid configurations for an `n x n` board with no initial moves.

The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the number of configurations for a board of size `i x i`. This relation is derived from the problem constraints and the nature of rook placements.

However, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. **Initialization of `dp` array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, but it is not clear why this specific size is chosen. Given that the maximum value of `n` is `3 * 10^5`, the `dp` array should be initialized to at least this size.
2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called before reading the input, which is fine, but it should be ensured that it is called with the correct argument, which is the maximum possible value of `n` (i.e., `3 * 10^5`).
3. **Computation of `invalid` set**: The `invalid` set is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied after `k` moves. However, the program only adds `r` and `c` to the set, which is incorrect. It should add both `r` and `c` as separate entries because they represent different dimensions (rows and columns).
4. **Calculation of remaining positions**: The program calculates the number of remaining valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`, which is incorrect because `invalid` contains both rows and columns, so its length is twice the number of occupied rows/columns.
5. **Handling of `k=0`**: When `k=0`, the program should directly use `dp[n]` as the result, but the current implementation handles this correctly.

Given the above points, especially the incorrect handling of the `invalid` set and the computation of remaining positions, the program is not correct as it stands.
