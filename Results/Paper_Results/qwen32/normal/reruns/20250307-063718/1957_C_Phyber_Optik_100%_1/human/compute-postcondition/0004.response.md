The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, and other variables (`t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`) do not affect the loop's continuation directly.

To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The other variables should remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `i` is 4**
