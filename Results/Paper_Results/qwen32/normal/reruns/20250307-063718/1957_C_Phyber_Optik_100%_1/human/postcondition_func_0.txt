The function `func_1` calculates and returns the value of `dp[n]` where `dp` is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function accepts an integer `n` as input, which represents the index up to which the sequence is computed.
