The code snippet provided calculates a new value for `dp[i]` based on the previous values in the `dp` array. Here's the updated value for `dp[i]`:

`dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`

Given the initial state:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `i` is 5

We substitute these values into the formula to find `dp[5]`:

`dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * (5 - 1) * dp[3]) % 1000000007`
`dp[5] = (25 + 2 * 4 * 7) % 1000000007`
`dp[5] = (25 + 56) % 1000000007`
`dp[5] = 81 % 1000000007`
`dp[5] = 81`

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, `i` is 5**
