In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, as the loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `i = n`. The state of `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as they do not appear in the loop head. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 3. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
