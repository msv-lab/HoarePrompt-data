The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The value of `n` must remain the same or be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 5**
