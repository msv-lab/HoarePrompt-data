Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n` which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. Based on the provided constraints and the description, the function seems to be designed to process a test case with a grid of size n x n and a series of moves. However, the provided function signature `def func_1(n):` only includes `n` as a parameter, and the output description does not specify what the function returns. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, but the exact return value or behavior is not fully described.**
