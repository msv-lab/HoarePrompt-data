The code snippet provided initializes an element in the `dp` list (or array) at index 1 with the value 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the specific moves `r_i` and `c_i` are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `dp[1]` is 1.**
