The given code snippet calculates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The initial state provides values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the first two elements of the `dp` array. The code snippet does not specify a loop or the range for `i`, so we will assume that `i` is a specific value greater than 2, as `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are already defined.

Given:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We will calculate `dp[i]` for some `i > 2`. Let's assume `i` is 3 for this calculation.

Calculation:
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7`

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the lines containing `r_i` and `c_i` are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` denoting the i-th move, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7.**
