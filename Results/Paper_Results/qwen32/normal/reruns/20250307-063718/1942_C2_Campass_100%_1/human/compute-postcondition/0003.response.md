Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
