Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least one element, `sx` is `sx + y * 2` if `y < c`, otherwise `sx` remains unchanged, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and `c` is `i // 2`.**
