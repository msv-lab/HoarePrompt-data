The code snippet `sx += i` increments the value of `sx` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `x`, the new value of `sx` will be the previous value of `sx` plus `x`.

Let's break down the possible values of `sx` based on the initial conditions:
- If `y < c`, `sx` was initially set to `6 * y + x + i`, and then `sx` becomes `6 * y + x + i + i` which simplifies to `6 * y + x + 2 * i` (since `i` is `x`).
- If `y >= c`, `sx` was initially set to `x + 4 * y + i`, and then `sx` becomes `x + 4 * y + i + i` which simplifies to `x + 4 * y + 2 * i` (since `i` is `x`).

In both cases, `i` is `x`, so `sx` is effectively increased by `x`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is x // 2, and `sx` is increased by `x`. If `y < c`, `sx` is now `6 * y + x + 2 * i`. Otherwise, `sx` is now `x + 4 * y + 2 * i`.**
