The code snippet `y -= c` decrements the value of `y` by `c`. Here, `c` is defined as `i // 2`, where `i` is the third element in the list `val`. The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `i`. The output state will reflect the new value of `y` after the decrement.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements; `i` is the third element in `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `i`; `y` is decreased by `c`.**
