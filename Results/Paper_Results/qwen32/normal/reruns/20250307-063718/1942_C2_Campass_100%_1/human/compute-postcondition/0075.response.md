The code snippet provided increments `sx` by the value of `y * 2`. The other variables `val`, `c`, `sx`, `y`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but only `sx` is modified by the code.

Let's break down the changes:
- `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value. This property remains unchanged.
- `c` is `i // 2`. This value remains unchanged.
- `sx` is increased by `i`. This value is further increased by `y * 2` in the given code snippet.
- `y` is decreased by `i // 2`. This value remains unchanged in the provided code snippet.
- `i` is the next element in the list `val`. This value remains unchanged.

The new value of `sx` is the sum of its previous value, `i`, and `y * 2`.

Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i + y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `i` is the next element in the list `val`.**
