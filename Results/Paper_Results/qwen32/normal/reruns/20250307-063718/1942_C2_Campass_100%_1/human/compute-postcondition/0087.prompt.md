Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x + 1` and `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness (even numbers first) and then by value.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `c` is `i // 2`; `i` is the next element in the list `val`; `sx` is increased by `i`; `y` is decreased by `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `i` is the next element in the list `val`; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2; `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `i`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `y * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `sx` and the loop or if statement continues; `y` is decreased by `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
