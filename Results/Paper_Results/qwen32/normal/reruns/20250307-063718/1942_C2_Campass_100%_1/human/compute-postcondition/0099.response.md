Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `val` is an empty list.
- `sx` is 0.
- `y` is decreased by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements `i` in `val` (since `val` is empty, `y` remains unchanged).
- `cons` is `x + sx - 2` (simplified to `x - 2` since `sx` is 0).
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `n` is the first value returned by `R()`.
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `y` is the third value returned by `R()`.
- `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.

Code Snippet:
```
c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
```

Since `l` is the list returned by `R()` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and `i` is not defined in the initial state, we need to assume `i` is a valid index within the range of `l`.

The output state will include the calculation of `c` based on the elements of `l` at indices `i` and `i-1`.

Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `sx` is 0, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 1, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the variable `c` is introduced and assigned the value `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, where `l` is the list returned by `R()` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and `i` is a valid index within the range of `l`.
