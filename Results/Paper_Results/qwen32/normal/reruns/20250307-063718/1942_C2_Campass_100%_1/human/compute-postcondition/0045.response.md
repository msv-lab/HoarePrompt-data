To determine the output of the `print(cons)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables step by step.

1. **Initial State and Variables:**
   - `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
   - `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
   - `y` is an integer that is decremented by the sum of `c` for all elements in `val`.
   - `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
   - `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
   - `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`.
   - `i` is the last element in `val`.
   - `c` is `i // 2` for the last element in `val`.
   - `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`.
   - `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.

2. **Key Variables for the Output:**
   - `x` is the number of distinct integers in `val`.
   - `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`.
   - `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.

3. **Understanding `cons`:**
   - `cons` is a function of `x` and `sx`. Since `x` is the number of elements in `val` and `sx` is the sum of these elements, `cons` is derived directly from these values.
   - The specific values of `x` and `sx` depend on the input and the sorting criteria used to create `val`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(cons)` statement will output the value of `cons`, which is `x + sx - 2`.
   - Since `x` and `sx` are determined by the input and the sorting criteria, we can describe `cons` in terms of these variables.

Given the information, the output will be:

Output: **x + sx - 2 (where x is the number of elements in val and sx is the sum of all elements in val)**
