The value of `c` is assigned the result of the integer division of `i` by 2. Since `i` is the third element in the list `val`, the value of `c` is `val[2] // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`**.
