The given Python code snippet updates the value of the variable `c` by recalculating it with the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. 

Given the initial state, we have:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `sx` is 0.
- `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
- `val` is `[c, c]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `c` is initially `l[2] - l[1] - 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `c` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, which is `l[3] - l[2] - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is `[c, c]`, `i` is 3, `c` is `l[3] - l[2] - 1`.**
