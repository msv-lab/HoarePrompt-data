The code snippet `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged because they are not referenced or modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its previous value**.
