The code snippet provided is `sx += y * 2`. This means the value of `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value. The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is updated to its original value plus `y * 2`.**
