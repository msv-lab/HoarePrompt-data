The code snippet calculates the value of `cons` based on the existing variables `x` and `sx`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `R`, `l`, `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged, except for the calculation of `cons`. The new value of `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that `y` is decremented by the sum of `c` for all elements in `val`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is the last element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2` for the last element in `val`, and `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.**
