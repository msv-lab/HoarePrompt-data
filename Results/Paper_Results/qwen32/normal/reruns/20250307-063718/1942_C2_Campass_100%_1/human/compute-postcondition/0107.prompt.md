Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is an empty list; `sx` is 0; `y` is decreased by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements `i` in `val`; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` is the second value returned by `R()`, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a list containing `c`, `sx` is 0, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 1, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a list containing `c` and `c` (the new appended value), `sx` is 0, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 4, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[4] - l[3] - 1`, `i` is 4

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list containing `c`, `c`, and `c`; `sx` is 0; `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 5, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[5] - l[4] - 1`, `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
