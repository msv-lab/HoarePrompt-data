Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 4 * y + x if y < x // 2, otherwise sx is x + y * 2, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x (indicating the end of the loop), `c` is x // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `R`, `sx`, `l`, `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
