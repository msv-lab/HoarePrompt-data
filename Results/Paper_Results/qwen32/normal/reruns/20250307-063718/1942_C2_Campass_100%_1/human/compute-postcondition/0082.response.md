The code snippet `sx += y * 2` modifies the variable `sx` by adding the value of `y * 2` to it. The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `i` is the next element in the list `val`; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2; `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `y * 2`.**
