The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads multiple space-separated integers from the input and returns them as a map object. This lambda function does not directly modify any existing variables but provides a way to read input values. Since the code does not execute the lambda function or modify any existing variables, the initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the `R` lambda function.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.**
