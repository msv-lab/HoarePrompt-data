The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or switch construct. Therefore, none of the variables `val`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, `n`, `l`, or `c` are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one element, `sx` is `sx + y * 2`, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `i // 2`, and `y` is less than `c`.**
