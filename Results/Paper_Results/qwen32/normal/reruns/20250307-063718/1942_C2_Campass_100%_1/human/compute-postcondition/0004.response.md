The code snippet `n, x, y = R()` assigns the values returned by the lambda function `R()` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, given the initial state, we know that `n`, `x`, and `y` already have specific values. The lambda function `R()` is expected to read space-separated integers from the input and map them to a map object, but since it is immediately unpacked into `n`, `x`, and `y`, we can infer that `R()` will return the same values that `n`, `x`, and `y` already hold in this context.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation. The variable `t` and the lambda function `R()` remain unaffected as well.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.**
