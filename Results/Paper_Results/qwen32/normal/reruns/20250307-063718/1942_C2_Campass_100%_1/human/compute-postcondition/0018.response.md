The code snippet `val.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Given that the initial state of `val` is `[c, c]`, after appending `c` again, `val` becomes `[c, c, c]`.

Here are the details of the output state:
- `t` remains the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` remains an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- `R` remains a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `sx` remains 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
- `val` is updated to `[c, c, c]`.
- `i` remains 3.
- `c` remains `l[3] - l[2] - 1`.
