The code snippet provided appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, `val` initially contains a single element `c`. After executing the code, `val` will contain two elements: the original `c` and the newly appended `c`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` remains an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- `R` remains a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `sx` remains 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
- `val` now contains two elements: `[c, c]`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `c` remains `l[2] - l[1] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is `[c, c]`, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`.**
