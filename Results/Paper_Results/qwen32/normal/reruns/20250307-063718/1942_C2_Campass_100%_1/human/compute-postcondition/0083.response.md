Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `i` is the next element in the list `val`; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2; `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `y * 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `val`, `i`, `c`, and `sx` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables.
