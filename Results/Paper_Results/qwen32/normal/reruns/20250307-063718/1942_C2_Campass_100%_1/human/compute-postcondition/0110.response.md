The given code snippet only affects the variable `c`. The variable `c` is assigned the value of `i` integer divided by 2 (`i // 2`). None of the other variables (`val`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, `n`, `l`) are altered by this code.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one element, `sx` is 0, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `i // 2`.**
