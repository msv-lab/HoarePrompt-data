The code snippet `l = list(R())` converts the result of the lambda function `R()` into a list and assigns it to the variable `l`. The lambda function `R()` is supposed to map space-separated integers from input to a map object. Therefore, `l` will be a list of integers read from the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `sx` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` is introduced and will hold the list of integers from the second line of the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object; `sx` is 0; `l` is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
