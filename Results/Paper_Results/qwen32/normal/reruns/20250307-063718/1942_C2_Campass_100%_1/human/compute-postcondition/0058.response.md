Output State: **`val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` must be at least `i`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.**

Natural Language: The last element of the list `val` is `c`, which is now calculated as the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of list `l`, minus 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `x` must be at least the new value of `i`.
