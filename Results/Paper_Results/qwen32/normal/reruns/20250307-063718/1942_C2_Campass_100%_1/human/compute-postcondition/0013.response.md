The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- The loop will execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `x + 1`.
- To execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

No other variables in the loop head (`x`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the single element `c`, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`**
