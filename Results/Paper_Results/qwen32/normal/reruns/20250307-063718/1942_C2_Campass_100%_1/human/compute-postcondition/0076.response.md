Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i + y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `i` is the next element in the list `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain as described in the initial state, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
