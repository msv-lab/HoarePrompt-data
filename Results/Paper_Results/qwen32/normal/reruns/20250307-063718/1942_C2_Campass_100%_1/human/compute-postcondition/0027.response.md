The code snippet `sx += i` adds the value of `i` to `sx`. Given the initial state, `sx` is either `y * 2` if `y < x // 2`, or `0` otherwise. After executing the code, `sx` will be updated to its previous value plus `i`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `y < x // 2`, `sx` initially is `y * 2`. After the operation, `sx` will be `y * 2 + i`.
2. If `y >= x // 2`, `sx` initially is `0`. After the operation, `sx` will be `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is `y * 2 + i` if `y < x // 2`, otherwise `sx` is `i`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is `x`, `c` is `x // 2`. If `y < x // 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
