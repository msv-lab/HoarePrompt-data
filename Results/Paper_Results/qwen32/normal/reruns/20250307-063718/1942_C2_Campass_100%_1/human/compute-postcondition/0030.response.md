The code snippet `c = i // 2` updates the value of `c` based on the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is `x` (indicating the end of the loop), the new value of `c` will be `x // 2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is y * 2 + i if y < x // 2, otherwise sx is i, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x (indicating the end of the loop), `c` is x // 2`.**
