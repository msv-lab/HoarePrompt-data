The code snippet provided is `sx += y * 2`. This means the value of `sx` will be updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value.

Let's break down the initial state and the effect of the code:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c`.
- `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it.
- `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x).
- `i` is x.
- `c` is x // 2.
- `sx` is calculated differently based on the value of `y` relative to `c`. If `y < c`, `sx` is `4 * y + x + i`; otherwise, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + i`. If `y < c`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The code `sx += y * 2` modifies `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value.

Given the initial state, we need to account for the two possible initial values of `sx`:
1. If `y < c`, `sx` was initially `4 * y + x + i`.
2. If `y ≥ c`, `sx` was initially `x + y * 2 + i`.

After the code `sx += y * 2` is executed:
- If `y < c`, `sx` becomes `4 * y + x + i + y * 2 = 6 * y + x + i`.
- If `y ≥ c`, `sx` becomes `x + y * 2 + i + y * 2 = x + 2 * y * 2 + i = x + 4 * y + i`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c`.
- `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it.
- `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x).
- `i` is x.
- `c` is x // 2.
- If `y < c`, `sx` is `6 * y + x + i`.
- If `y ≥ c`, `sx` is `x + 4 * y + i`.
