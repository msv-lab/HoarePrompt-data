The code snippet calculates the difference between the second and first elements of the list `l`, subtracting 1 from this difference, and assigns this value to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, we know that `l[0]` is the smallest element in `l` (which is at least 1), and `l[1]` is the second smallest element in `l`. Therefore, `l[i] - l[i - 1]` (where `i` is 1) gives the difference between the second smallest and the smallest element in `l`, and subtracting 1 from this difference gives the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `c` is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`**
