Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted first by evenness (even numbers first) and then by value; `sx` is 0; `y` is the third value returned by `R()`; `cons` is `x - 2`; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the first value returned by `R()`; `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a list containing at least one element, `sx` is `sx + i`, `y` is the third value returned by `R()` minus `i // 2`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and `c` is `i // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is updated to its original value plus `y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sx` remains unchanged. `sx` is now `sx` plus `i`. `y` is `y - c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list containing at least two elements; `i` is the third element in `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `i`; `y` is decreased by `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
