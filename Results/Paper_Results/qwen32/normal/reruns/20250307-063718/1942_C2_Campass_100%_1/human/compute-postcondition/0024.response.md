The code snippet `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `sx` is 0, the new value of `sx` will be `y * 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `R`, `l`, `val`, `i`, and `c`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y < x // 2, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is `y * 2`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is `x`, `c` is `x // 2`.**
