The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the `while` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the integer read from the input representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that it is a positive integer.

Given the current state, `t` is the integer read from the input, and there are no constraints provided that make `t` non-positive. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is the integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.**
