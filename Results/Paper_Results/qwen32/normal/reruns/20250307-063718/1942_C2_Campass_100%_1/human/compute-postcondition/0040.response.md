Postcondition: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is x // 2. If `y < c`, `sx` is set to `6 * y + x + i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sx` is set to `x + 4 * y + i`.**
