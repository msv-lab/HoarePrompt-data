The code snippet `sx += i` increases the value of `sx` by `i`. The values of `val`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged. The condition involving `y` and `c` does not affect the execution of this line.

Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i`, and `y` is unchanged.**
