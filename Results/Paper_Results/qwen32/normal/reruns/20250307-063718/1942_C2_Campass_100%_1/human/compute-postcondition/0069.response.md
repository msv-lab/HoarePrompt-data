Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, and `val` must have at least one element; `c` is `i // 2`; the current value of `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is increased by `y * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `val`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged. The variable `sx` is increased by `y * 2`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
