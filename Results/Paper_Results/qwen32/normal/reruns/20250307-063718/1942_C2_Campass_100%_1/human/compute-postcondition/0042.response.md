The code snippet `y -= c` reduces the value of `y` by `c`. Given the initial state, we know that `c` is `x // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `y` after the operation will be `y - (x // 2)`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so we update only `y` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c` and now `y` is `y - (x // 2)`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is x // 2, and `sx` is increased by `x`. If `y < c`, `sx` is now `6 * y + x + 2 * i`. Otherwise, `sx` is now `x + 4 * y + 2 * i`.**
