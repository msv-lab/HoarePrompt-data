The code snippet appends the value of `n + l[0]` to the list `l`. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code has been executed:

- `t` is still the integer read from the input minus 1.
- `n` remains the same integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` remains the same integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` remains the same integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- `R` is still the lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
- `sx` remains 0.
- `l` is now a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it.**
