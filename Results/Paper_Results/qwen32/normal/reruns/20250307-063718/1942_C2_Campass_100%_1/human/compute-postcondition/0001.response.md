The provided code snippet reads a single integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices do not change with this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.**
