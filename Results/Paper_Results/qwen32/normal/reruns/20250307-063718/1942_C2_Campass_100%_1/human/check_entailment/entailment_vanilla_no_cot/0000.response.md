Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sorting and Calculation of Gaps**:
   - The program calculates the gaps between chosen vertices and sorts them. This is a good start because forming triangles often involves considering gaps between vertices.
   - However, the sorting key `(1 - x & 1, x)` is not clear and might not be optimal for maximizing the number of triangles.

2. **Choosing Additional Vertices**:
   - The program attempts to maximize the number of triangles by adding additional vertices. The logic for choosing these vertices is based on the gaps calculated and the remaining allowed vertices (`y`).
   - The calculation `c = i // 2` and the subsequent logic to update `sx` and `y` might not correctly reflect the best strategy to maximize the number of triangles.

3. **Final Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The final calculation `cons = x + sx - 2` is not clearly derived from the problem requirements. The formula does not directly relate to the number of triangles formed.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Triangle Formation**:
   - A triangle can be formed by choosing three vertices such that they do not create intersecting diagonals.
   - The key is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles, which often involves a greedy or dynamic programming approach.

2. **Using Gaps**:
   - The gaps between chosen vertices are crucial. If a gap is large enough, it can be divided into smaller gaps by adding vertices, which can help in forming more triangles.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Strategy**:
   - A dynamic programming approach can be used to keep track of the maximum number of triangles that can be formed up to a certain point.
   - Alternatively, a greedy strategy can be used to iteratively add vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement a strategy to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. A more thorough approach involving proper gap analysis and a correct strategy for adding vertices is required. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
