Postcondition: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `i` is the next element in the list `val`; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `y * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `sx` and the loop or if statement continues.**
