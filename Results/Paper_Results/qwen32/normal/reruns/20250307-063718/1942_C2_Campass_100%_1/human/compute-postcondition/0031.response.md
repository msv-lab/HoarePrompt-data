The code snippet `sx += y * 2` modifies the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Let's determine the new value of `sx` based on the given conditions.

Initially, `sx` is defined as:
- `y * 2 + i` if `y < c` (where `c` is `x // 2`)
- `i` if `y >= c`

After the operation `sx += y * 2`, the new value of `sx` will be:
- `y * 2 + i + y * 2 = 2 * y * 2 + i = 4 * y + i` if `y < c`
- `i + y * 2` if `y >= c`

Since `i` is `x` (as per the initial state), the new value of `sx` becomes:
- `4 * y + x` if `y < c`
- `x + y * 2` if `y >= c`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 4 * y + x if y < x // 2, otherwise sx is x + y * 2, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x (indicating the end of the loop), `c` is x // 2**
