Postcondition: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value. `c` is `i // 2`. If `y < c`, then `sx` is increased by `i + y * 2` and `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sx` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i // 2`. `i` is the next element in the list `val`.**
