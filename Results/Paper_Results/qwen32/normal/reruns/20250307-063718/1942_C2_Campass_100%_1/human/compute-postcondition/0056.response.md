Initial State: `val` is a list, `c` is an element to be appended to the list.

The code `val.append(c)` adds the element `c` to the end of the list `val`. This changes the state of `val` by including `c` as its new last element.

Output State: **`val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element.**
