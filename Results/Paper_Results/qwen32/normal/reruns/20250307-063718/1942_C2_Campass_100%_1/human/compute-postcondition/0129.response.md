The code snippet `sx += i` updates the value of `sx` by adding the value of `i` to it. The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The condition involving `y` and `c` does not impact this specific line of code, so we do not need to consider it for this calculation.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is updated to its previous value plus `i`.**
