To determine what will be printed by the `print(cons)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`.
2. `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`.
3. `val`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
4. `cons` is defined as `x + sx - 2`.

From this, we know:
- `sx` is a computed value based on the sum of `val`.
- `y` is adjusted based on `val`, but this does not affect `cons`.
- `cons` is explicitly defined as `x + sx - 2`, where `x` and `sx` are used in the calculation.

The `print(cons)` statement will output the value of `cons`. Given the definition of `cons`, we need to express it in terms of the known variables and the sum of `val`.

Output: **x + sx - 2 (where sx is the sum of all elements in `val` and x is the value of `x`)**
