Given the provided code snippet `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, we need to determine the new state of the variables after execution. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the affected variable:** The variable `c` is being assigned a value.
2. **Determine the value of `c`:** The value of `c` is calculated based on the elements of the list `l` at indices `i` and `i - 1`. Specifically, `c` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for `c`. However, we can describe the state in terms of the variables involved.

**Output State:** **`t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the first input integer; `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `y` is the third input integer; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object; `l` is the sorted list of integers from the input with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended; `val` is an empty list; `i` is not defined; `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`; `sx` is 0; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `c` is now set to the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of the list `l`, minus 1. All other variables remain in their initial state except for `c`.
