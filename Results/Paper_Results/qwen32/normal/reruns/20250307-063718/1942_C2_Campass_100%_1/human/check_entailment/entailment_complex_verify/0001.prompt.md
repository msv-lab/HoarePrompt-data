You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` vertices already chosen. We can select up to `y` additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. The key is to maximize the number of triangles by strategically choosing additional vertices.

### Approach

1. **Identify Gaps**: First, we need to identify the gaps between the chosen vertices. These gaps represent the number of sides between two consecutive vertices.
2. **Sort Gaps**: Sort these gaps in a way that prioritizes gaps that can form more triangles. Specifically, we should prioritize gaps that are odd in length (since they can form more triangles by adding vertices).
3. **Add Vertices to Gaps**: For each gap, determine how many additional vertices can be added to maximize the number of triangles without exceeding `y`.
4. **Calculate Triangles**: Calculate the number of triangles that can be formed based on the chosen vertices and the gaps.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of `x` vertices and sorts them.

2. **Handling Gaps**:
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices and wraps around by adding `n + l[0]` to the list.
   - It computes the gaps and sorts them based on a custom key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, which prioritizes odd gaps.

3. **Adding Vertices**:
   - For each gap, it calculates how many additional vertices (`c = i // 2`) can be added.
   - It checks if the remaining `y` vertices are sufficient to add `c` vertices to the current gap.
   - If not, it adds as many as possible and breaks out of the loop.
   - It keeps track of the total number of vertices added (`sx`).

4. **Calculating Triangles**:
   - The number of triangles is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.

### Issues and Corrections

#### Issue 1: Incorrect Calculation of Triangles

The formula `x + sx - 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be based on the number of triangles that can be formed with the chosen vertices. The number of triangles is actually determined by the number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn, which is related to the number of vertices and gaps.

#### Issue 2: Incorrect Handling of Gaps

The program sorts gaps based on a custom key, but this key does not correctly prioritize gaps for forming the maximum number of triangles. The correct approach should be to prioritize gaps that can form the most triangles by adding vertices.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the provided program is not correct. It does not correctly calculate the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
