Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that `y` is decremented by the sum of `c` for all elements in `val`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is the last element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2` for the last element in `val`, and `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value; `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`; `y` is decreased by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements `i` in `val`; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`, `val`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
