The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. The value of `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, and `l`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and constraints, but `val` now includes `c` as its last element.

Output State: **`val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` must be at least `i`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.**
