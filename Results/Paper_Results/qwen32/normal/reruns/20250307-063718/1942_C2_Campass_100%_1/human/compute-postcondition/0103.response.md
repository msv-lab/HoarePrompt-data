The code snippet `val.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Therefore, `val` will now contain its original elements plus the new element `c`.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing `c` and `c` (the new appended value), `sx` is 0, `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 4, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[4] - l[3] - 1`, `i` is 4**.

In simpler terms, the list `val` now includes an additional element `c` at the end, while all other variables retain their previous values.
