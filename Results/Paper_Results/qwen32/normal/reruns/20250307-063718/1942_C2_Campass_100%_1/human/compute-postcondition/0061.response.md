The code snippet provided is:

```python
c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
```

Given the initial state, `c` is initially defined as `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. The code snippet reassigns `c` with the same expression, so the value of `c` remains the same.

The variables `val`, `i`, `x`, and the list `l` are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` must be at least `i + 1`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`**.
