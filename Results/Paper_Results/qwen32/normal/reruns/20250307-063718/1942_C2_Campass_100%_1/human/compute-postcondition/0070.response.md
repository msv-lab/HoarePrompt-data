Postcondition: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, and `val` must have at least one element; `c` is `i // 2`. If the current value of `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is increased by `y * 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sx` and the loop continues.**
