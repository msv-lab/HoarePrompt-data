Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is `x`, `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that `0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is `y * 2 + i` if `y < x // 2`, otherwise `sx` is `i`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is `x`, `c` is `x // 2`. If `y < x // 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x (indicating the end of the loop), `c` is x // 2. If `y < c`, `sx` is 4 * y + x + i; otherwise, `sx` is x + y * 2 + i`. If `y < c`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y - c ≤ n - x minus `c` and now `y` is `y - (x // 2)`, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, `val` is a list containing x elements sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is x // 2, and `sx` is increased by `x`. If `y < c`, `sx` is now `6 * y + x + 2 * i`. Otherwise, `sx` is now `x + 4 * y + 2 * i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
