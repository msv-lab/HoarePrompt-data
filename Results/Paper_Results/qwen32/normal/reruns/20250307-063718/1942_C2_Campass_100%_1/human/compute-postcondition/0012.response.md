The code snippet appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the single element `c`, `i` is 1, `c` is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`**.
