Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the first input integer; `x` is the second input integer; `y` is the third input integer; `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object; `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it; `val` is a list containing `x` elements sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`; `i` is the last element in `val`; `c` is `i // 2` for the last element in `val`; `sx` is 0; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `sx` is explicitly set to 0 by the given code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
