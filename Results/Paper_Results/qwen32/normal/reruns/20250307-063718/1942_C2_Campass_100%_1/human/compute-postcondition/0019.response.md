Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `R` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a map object, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for i from 1 to x, `i` is `x`, `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `val` list will contain `x` elements. Each element in `val` represents the difference between consecutive elements in the list `l`, minus one. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `x`, and `c` will be the last computed difference, which is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
