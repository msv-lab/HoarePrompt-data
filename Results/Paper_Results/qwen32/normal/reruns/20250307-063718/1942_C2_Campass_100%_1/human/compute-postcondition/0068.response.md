The value of `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`. The values of `val`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged. Since `y` is less than `c`, this condition still holds true after the operation.

Output State: **`val` is a list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness and then by value, and `val` must have at least one element; `c` is `i // 2`; the current value of `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is increased by `y * 2`.**
