The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to some value that allowed the loop to execute, and `x` is the upper limit of the loop.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must be such that `i` is still less than or equal to `x`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element, and `i` is the current iteration value.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `x` should be at least `i` for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` was the value that allowed the loop to execute in the previous iteration, we increment `i` by 1. The state of `val` does not affect the loop's continuation, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`val` is a list that includes `c` as its last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` must be at least `i`**
