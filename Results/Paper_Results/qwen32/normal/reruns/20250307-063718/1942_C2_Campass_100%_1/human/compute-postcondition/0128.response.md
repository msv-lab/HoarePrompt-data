Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sx`, and the loop or if statement continues.**
