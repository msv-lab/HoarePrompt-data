The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Given that `val` initially contains `c` and `c`, after appending `c` again, `val` will contain `c`, `c`, and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing `c`, `c`, and `c`; `sx` is 0; `y` is the third value returned by `R()`, `cons` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first value returned by `R()`, `x` must be at least 5, `l` is the list returned by `R()` sorted with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `l[5] - l[4] - 1`, `i` is 5.**
