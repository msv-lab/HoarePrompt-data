Let's break down the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`val`**: A list of `x` elements sorted first by evenness (even numbers come before odd numbers) and then by value.
2. **`sx`**: The sum of all elements in the list `val`.
3. **`y`**: Decreased by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements `i` in `val`. However, this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore its final value for this task.
4. **`cons`**: Defined as `x + sx - 2`, where `x` is the number of elements in the list `val`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(cons)
```

### Analysis:
- **`x`**: The number of elements in the list `val`. Since `val` is a list of `x` elements, `x` is explicitly known as the length of `val`.
- **`sx`**: The sum of all elements in the list `val`. This is a computed value based on the elements of `val`.
- **`cons`**: Calculated as `x + sx - 2`. This is a direct formula involving `x` and `sx`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `cons`, which is `x + sx - 2`.

Since `x` is the number of elements in the list `val` and `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **x + sx - 2 (where x is the number of elements in the list `val` and sx is the sum of all elements in the list `val`)**
