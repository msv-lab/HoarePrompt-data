The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the only state we can adjust is the value that will be obtained from `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will execute. Let's denote this value by `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After one iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 if we were to think of it in terms of a countdown. However, since the loop head directly uses the value from `int(input())`, we need to consider what the next input should be for the loop to execute one more time.

If the loop has just finished an iteration, it means that the previous input value for `t` was greater than 0, and now it should be one less for the next iteration to occur. Therefore, if `t` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, the next value for `t` should be `t - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is equal to 1, no additional variables `ans1` and `ans2` are defined.** 

However, since `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, the correct state should reflect that `t` is decremented but still positive:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is equal to 1, no additional variables `ans1` and `ans2` are defined.**
