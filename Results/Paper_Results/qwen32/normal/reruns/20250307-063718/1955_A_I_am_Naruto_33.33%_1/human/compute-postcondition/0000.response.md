In the given task, the loop is controlled by the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. This means that the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the input itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not directly involved in the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.
4. The only state we can adjust is the input to the loop, which must be a number greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that the input to the loop is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, input must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**
