You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` because there's no discount available for a single yogurt.
   
2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, i.e., `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. Here, `n // 2` gives the number of pairs, and `n % 2` gives the number of single yogurts left over, which are bought at the regular price `a`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by directly returning `a`.
- For `n > 1`, the program considers both buying yogurts individually and in pairs, which is the optimal strategy.
- The formula `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that we maximize the use of the promotion while accounting for any remaining single yogurts correctly.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the correct output for all the given test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles all edge cases, including when `n` is 1 and when `n` is greater than 1. There are no apparent issues with the logic or implementation.

**Correctness: True**.

The program is correct as it meets the requirements in the problem description for all potential cases.
