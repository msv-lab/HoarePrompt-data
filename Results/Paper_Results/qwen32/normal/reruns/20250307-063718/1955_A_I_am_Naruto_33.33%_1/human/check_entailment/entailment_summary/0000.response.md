Reasoning: 

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for purchasing `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. For `n = 1`, the cost is simply `a` because there's no promotion applicable for a single yogurt.
2. For `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually at the regular price `a`, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible at the promotional price `b`, with any remaining yogurt bought individually at the regular price `a`. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
3. The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

The execution summary aligns with this logic, and the program handles all edge cases, including when `n` is 1 and when `n` is even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
