Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer, and `b` is the third integer; `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans1` is now equal to the product of `a` and `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values.
