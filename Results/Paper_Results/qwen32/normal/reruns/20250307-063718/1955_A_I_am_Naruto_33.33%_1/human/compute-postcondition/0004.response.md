The code snippet calculates `ans2` based on the values of `b`, `n`, and `a`. The value of `ans1` is not changed by the given code snippet. Here’s the updated state:

- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer, and `b` is the third integer; `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`; `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**
