Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `ans1` is `a * n`; `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
