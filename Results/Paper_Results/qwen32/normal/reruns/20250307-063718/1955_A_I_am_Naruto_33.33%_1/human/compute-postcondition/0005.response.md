To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement, let's break down the expressions `ans1` and `ans2` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it's not used in the calculations of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is the second integer.
- `b` is the third integer.
- `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`: \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \).
- `ans2` is calculated as \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times (n \mod 2) \).

### Calculations:
1. **ans1 Calculation:**
   - \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \)
   - This is straightforward: multiply `a` by `n`.

2. **ans2 Calculation:**
   - \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times (n \mod 2) \)
   - \( \frac{n}{2} \) is the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - \( n \mod 2 \) is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If `n` is even, \( n \mod 2 = 0 \); if `n` is odd, \( n \mod 2 = 1 \).

### Cases for `ans2`:
- If `n` is even:
  - \( n \mod 2 = 0 \)
  - \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times 0 = b \times \frac{n}{2} \)
- If `n` is odd:
  - \( n \mod 2 = 1 \)
  - \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times 1 = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \)

### Final Output:
The `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement will print the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2` based on the above calculations.

### Conclusion:
- If `n` is even:
  - \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \)
  - \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} \)
- If `n` is odd:
  - \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \)
  - \( \text{ans2} = b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \)

The final printed value will be the smaller of `a * n` and either `b * (n // 2)` or `b * (n // 2) + a`, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.

Output: **min(a * n, b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2))**
