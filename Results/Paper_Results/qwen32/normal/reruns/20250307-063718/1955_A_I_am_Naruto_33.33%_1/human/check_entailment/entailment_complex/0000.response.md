### Reasoning:
The function `func()` processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

For each test case:
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1`: The cost when buying all yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
  - `ans2`: The cost when buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt (if any) at the regular price, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a` because there is no promotion for a single yogurt.

The function correctly handles all the given constraints and examples. For instance:
- In the third test case, `n=3`, `a=5`, and `b=11`. The function calculates `ans1 = 15` and `ans2 = 11 + 5 = 16`, so it prints `15`.
- In the fourth test case, `n=4`, `a=5`, and `b=11`. The function calculates `ans1 = 20` and `ans2 = 22`, so it prints `20`.

The logic in the function is consistent with the problem statement, and the annotated states of the program align with the expected behavior.
