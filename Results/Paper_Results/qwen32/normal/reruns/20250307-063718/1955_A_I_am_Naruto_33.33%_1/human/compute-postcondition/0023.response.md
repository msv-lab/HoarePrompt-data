Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - t_initial, where t_initial is the initial value of t; no more iterations will occur as t has reached 0.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0, meaning no more iterations will occur. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last iteration will still be in memory, but they will not be used further since the loop has ended. The variables `ans1` and `ans2` will only exist if `n` was greater than 1 in the last iteration, and they will hold their last computed values. The initial value of `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations that were executed.
