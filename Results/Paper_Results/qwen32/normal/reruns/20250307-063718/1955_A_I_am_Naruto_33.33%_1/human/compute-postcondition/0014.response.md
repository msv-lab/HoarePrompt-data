Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

The variable `a` is an integer obtained from the input. Since the exact value of `a` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a`.

Output: **a (where a is an integer obtained from the input)**
