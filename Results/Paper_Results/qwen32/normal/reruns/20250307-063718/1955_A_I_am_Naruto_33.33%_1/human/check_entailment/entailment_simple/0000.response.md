### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts on promotion.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Calculation for Minimum Cost**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought on promotion, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - The minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` is printed.
   - If `n == 1`, since buying two yogurts on promotion is not possible, the cost is simply `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case on a new line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n=2, a=5, b=9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=3, a=5, b=9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=3, a=5, b=11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15` (since 15 is less than 16)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=4, a=5, b=11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20` (since 20 is less than 22)

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided logic and example verification.

**Correctness: True**
