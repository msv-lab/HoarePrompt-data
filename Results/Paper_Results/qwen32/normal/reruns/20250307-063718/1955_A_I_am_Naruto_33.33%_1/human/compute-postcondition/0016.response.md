The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop iterates based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state we need to adjust is related to the input value that controls the number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` are defined based on the value of `n` if `n` > 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be decremented by 1. This means `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.**
