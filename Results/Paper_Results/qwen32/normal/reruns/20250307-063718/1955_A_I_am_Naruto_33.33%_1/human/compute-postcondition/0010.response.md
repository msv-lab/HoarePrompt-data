The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state mentions the variable `t` which is not affected by this code snippet. The variables `ans1` and `ans2` are defined based on the value of `n` after the input, but the code snippet itself only handles the input reading and does not define `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
