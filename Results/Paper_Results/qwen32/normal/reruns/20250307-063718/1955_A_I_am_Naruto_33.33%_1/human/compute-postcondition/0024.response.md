The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function takes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints are that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and for each test case, `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30`. The function returns a value based on the input for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
