You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - t_initial, where t_initial is the initial value of t; no more iterations will occur as t has reached 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost, where the cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. He can either buy each yogurt individually for `a` burles or buy two yogurts together for `b` burles. The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles he needs to spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost in the following way:
1. If `n > 1`:
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible (i.e., `b * (n // 2)`) and any remaining yogurt is bought individually (i.e., `a * (n % 2)`).
   - It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
2. If `n == 1`:
   - It directly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: n > 1**
  - The program correctly calculates the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`ans1`).
  - It also correctly calculates the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and any remaining yogurt individually (`ans2`).
  - It then prints the minimum of these two costs, which is the correct approach.
  
- **Case 2: n == 1**
  - The program correctly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy, and there's no discount available for a single yogurt.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 2, a = 5, b = 9**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
   
2. **Test Case 2: n = 3, a = 5, b = 9**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
   
3. **Test Case 3: n = 3, a = 5, b = 11**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
   
4. **Test Case 4: n = 4, a = 5, b = 11**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
