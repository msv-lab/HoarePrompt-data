Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(a)
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `n`, but not the exact values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` is an integer obtained from the input, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variable `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer obtained from the input)**
