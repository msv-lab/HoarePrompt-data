Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. He can either buy each yogurt individually for `a` burles or buy two yogurts together for `b` burles. The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles he needs to spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost in the following way:
1. If `n > 1`:
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible (i.e., `b * (n // 2)`) and any remaining yogurt is bought individually (i.e., `a * (n % 2)`).
   - It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
2. If `n == 1`:
   - It directly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: n > 1**
  - The program correctly calculates the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`ans1`).
  - It also correctly calculates the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and any remaining yogurt individually (`ans2`).
  - It then prints the minimum of these two costs, which is the correct approach.
  
- **Case 2: n == 1**
  - The program correctly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy, and there's no discount available for a single yogurt.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 2, a = 5, b = 9**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
   
2. **Test Case 2: n = 3, a = 5, b = 9**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
   
3. **Test Case 3: n = 3, a = 5, b = 11**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
   
4. **Test Case 4: n = 4, a = 5, b = 11**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
