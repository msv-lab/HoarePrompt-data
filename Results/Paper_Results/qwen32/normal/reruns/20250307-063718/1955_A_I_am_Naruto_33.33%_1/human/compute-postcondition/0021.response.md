To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `n > 1`, then:
  - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
  - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
- If `n` is not greater than 1, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet `print(a)` simply prints the value of the variable `a`. The value of `a` is provided as part of the input and is not dependent on any calculations or conditions within the code snippet itself.

### Output:
The output will be the value of the variable `a` as it is directly printed.

Output: **a (where a is the value of the integer a obtained from the input)**
