Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(ans1, ans2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculation of `ans1`**:
   - `ans1` is simply `a * n`.

2. **Calculation of `ans2`**:
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
   - Here, `b * n // 2` computes the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
   - `a * n % 2` computes the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

3. **Determine the Minimum**:
   - The `min(ans1, ans2)` function will return the smaller of the two values `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Output:
The output will be the smaller value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
