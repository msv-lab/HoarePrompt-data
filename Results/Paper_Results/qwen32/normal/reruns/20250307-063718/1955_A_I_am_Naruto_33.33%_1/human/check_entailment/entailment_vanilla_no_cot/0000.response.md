Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, where the price for one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
2. **Approach**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, calculate two potential costs:
     - `ans1`: Cost when buying each yogurt individually, i.e., `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: Cost when buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price, and then buying any remaining individual yogurt at the regular price, i.e., `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` since there's no promotion applicable.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It correctly calculates `ans1` as `a * n`.
- It calculates `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, which is correct for the following reasons:
  - `n // 2` computes the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
  - `n % 2` computes the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
- The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Testing the Program with the Example:
Let's verify the program with the given example inputs:

1. **First Test Case** (`n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`):
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost is `9`.

2. **Second Test Case** (`n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`):
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost is `14`.

3. **Third Test Case** (`n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`):
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost is `15` (since `ans1 < ans2`).

4. **Fourth Test Case** (`n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`):
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost is `20`.

The program produces the correct output for all the test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given problem description.

**Your response:** Correctness: **True**
