The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but after the code executes, these variables will hold the input values. The variables `t`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged or undefined as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.**
