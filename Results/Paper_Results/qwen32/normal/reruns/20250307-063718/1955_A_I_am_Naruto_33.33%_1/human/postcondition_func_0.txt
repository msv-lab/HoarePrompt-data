The function processes a number of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost, where the cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.
