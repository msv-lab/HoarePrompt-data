The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since `ans1` is now defined, it holds the value of `a * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `ans1` is `a * n`.**
