To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement, we need to understand the values of `ans1` and `ans2` based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, `t` is not used in the given code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `ans1` is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `ans2` is a bit more complex. It consists of two parts:
     - `b * n // 2`: This is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
     - `a * n % 2`: This is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

3. **Combining the parts:**
   - `ans2` effectively computes `b * n // 2` and adds the remainder of `a * n` when divided by 2.
   - This means `ans2` is influenced by both `a` and `b`, and it includes a correction term based on the parity of `a * n`.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - The `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement will print the smaller of the two values `ans1` and `ans2`.

Given the definitions and calculations, the output will be the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
