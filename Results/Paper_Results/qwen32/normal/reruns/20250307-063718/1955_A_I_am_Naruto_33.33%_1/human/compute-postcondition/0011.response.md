The value of `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for the new value of `ans1`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `ans1` is `a * n`.**
