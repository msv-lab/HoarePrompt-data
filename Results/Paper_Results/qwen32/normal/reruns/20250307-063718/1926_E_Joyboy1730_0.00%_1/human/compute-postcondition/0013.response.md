To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the variable `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `n` is updated by subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from itself. This operation effectively halves `n` and rounds it down to the nearest integer.

Let's analyze the behavior of the loop:

1. In the first iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
2. In the second iteration, `n` is again updated to the new `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
3. This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

Since `n` is halved (and rounded down) in each iteration, the number of iterations required for `n` to become 0 is approximately `log2(n) + 1`. However, the exact number of iterations can be determined by repeatedly applying the operation until `n` reaches 0.

Given the constraints, the loop will execute until `n` is reduced to 0. At this point, the value of `n` will be 0, and the values of `t` and `k` will remain unchanged from their initial values. The list `L` remains empty as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` (which is 0, so this condition is vacuously true), `L` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0, and the final state is that `n` is 0 while `t` and `k` retain their initial values, and `L` remains empty.
