Since the given code snippet only reassigns the value of `m` and does not change any other variables, the value of `m` is recalculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**.
