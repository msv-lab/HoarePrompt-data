Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list with at least one element (though `L` is not used in the print statement).
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (though `tot` and `a` are not used in the print statement).
- `pow` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is an input integer, meaning its value is not defined by the problem statement but is assumed to be a specific integer provided as input.

The expression `2 * k - 1` will compute twice the value of `k` and then subtract 1. Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to just `2 * k - 1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
