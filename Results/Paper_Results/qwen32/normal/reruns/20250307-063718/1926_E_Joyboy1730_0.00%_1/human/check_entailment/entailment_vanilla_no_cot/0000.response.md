Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Initialization of `L`**: The list `L` is initialized as an empty list but is never populated with any values. This means that the loop `for a in L:` will not execute any iterations, and the function will not print anything for any test case.

2. **Calculation of `m` and decrement of `n`**: The code calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2` and then decrements `n` by `m`. This loop is intended to determine the number of odd numbers up to `n`, but it does not store these values in `L`, and the loop continues until `n` becomes 0. This part of the code is correct for determining the number of odd numbers, but the results are not used.

3. **Logic for finding the k-th card**: The loop `for a in L:` is supposed to determine which segment the k-th card belongs to and then find the exact card. However, since `L` is empty, this loop never runs, and the function does not perform the necessary calculations.

4. **Printing the k-th card**: The print statement inside the loop `for a in L:` is intended to print the k-th card, but it is never reached because the loop does not execute.

To fix the program, you need to properly populate `L` with the counts of cards in each segment, and then use this information to determine the k-th card. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            L.append(m)
            n -= m
        
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            pow *= 2

func()
```

In this corrected version, `L` is populated with the counts of cards in each segment, and the logic for finding the k-th card is correctly implemented.
