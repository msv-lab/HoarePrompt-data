The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state provided includes `t` as an integer input, but since `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, its value remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**.
