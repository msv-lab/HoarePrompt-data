The code snippet `n -= m` decrements the value of `n` by the value of `m`. Given that the initial state specifies `n` is 1 and `m` is 1, the operation results in `n` becoming 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 1**.
