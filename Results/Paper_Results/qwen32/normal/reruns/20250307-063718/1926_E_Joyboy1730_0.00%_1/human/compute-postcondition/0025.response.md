Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is defined as `k - tot`.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is 2.
- `tot` is increased by `a`.
- `a` is `L[1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **`pow`**: This is explicitly given as 2.
2. **`k`**: The value of `k` is defined as `k - tot`. However, the initial value of `k` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine its exact value directly. But we know that `k` is adjusted by subtracting `tot` from it.
3. **`tot`**: Initially, `tot` is not defined, but it is increased by `a`. The value of `a` is `L[1]`, which means `tot` is increased by the second element of list `L`.
4. **`a`**: This is the second element of list `L`, i.e., `a = L[1]`.
5. **`L`**: This is a list with at least one element, but we don't know the exact elements of the list.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```
Given `pow` is 2, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print(2 * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Determining the Output:
- We know `pow` is 2.
- The value of `k` is not explicitly defined, but it is adjusted by subtracting `tot` from it.
- `tot` is increased by `a` (which is `L[1]`).

Since the exact values of `k` and `L[1]` are not provided, we can only express the final output in terms of `k` and `L[1]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `2 * (2 * k - 1)`, where `k` is adjusted by subtracting `tot` from it, and `tot` is increased by `L[1]`.

Output: **2 * (2 * k - 1) (where k is adjusted by subtracting tot from it, and tot is increased by L[1])**
