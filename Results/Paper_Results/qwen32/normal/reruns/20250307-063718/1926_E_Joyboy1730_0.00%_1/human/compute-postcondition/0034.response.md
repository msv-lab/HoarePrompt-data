Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is the value after the previous iteration, `a` is `L[2]`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
