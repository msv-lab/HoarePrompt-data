The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` was already defined as `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `m` does not change after this line of code is executed. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with respect to `m`.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
