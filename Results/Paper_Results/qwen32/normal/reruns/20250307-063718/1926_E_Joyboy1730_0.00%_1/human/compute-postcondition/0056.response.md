To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the formula used in the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (where `a` is some value not explicitly mentioned).
- `pow` is 1.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is an input integer, and its exact value is not provided in the initial state, so we will keep it as `k`.
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
- Substituting `pow` with 1, the expression simplifies to `1 * (2 * k - 1)`, which further simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
