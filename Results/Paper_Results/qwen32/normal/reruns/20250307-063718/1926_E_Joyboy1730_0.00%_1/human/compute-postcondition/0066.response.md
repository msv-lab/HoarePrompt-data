The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `L`, `pow`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. The value of `a` is the next element in `L` and is used to update `tot`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * `pow`, `tot` is `tot` + `a`, `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
