Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` (which is 0, so this condition is vacuously true), `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `tot` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
