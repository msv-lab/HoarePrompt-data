The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` has been updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than zero after this update.

Let's analyze the update operation:
- If `n` is even, `(n + 1) // 2` is equivalent to `n // 2 + 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `(n + 1) // 2` is equivalent to `(n // 2) + 1`.

In both cases, `n - (n + 1) // 2` results in `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) - 1` if `n` is odd. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than zero after this operation.

Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 before the update (because if `n` is 1, `n - (n + 1) // 2` will be 0, and the loop will not execute again).

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**
