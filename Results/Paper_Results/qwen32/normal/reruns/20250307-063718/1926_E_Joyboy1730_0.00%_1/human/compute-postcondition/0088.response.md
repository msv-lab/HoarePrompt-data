Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Natural language: `t` remains decremented by 1, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` retains its input integer value, `L` remains an empty list, and `m` is still calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
