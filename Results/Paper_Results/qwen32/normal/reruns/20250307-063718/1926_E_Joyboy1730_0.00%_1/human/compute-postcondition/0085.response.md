The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables `t`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
