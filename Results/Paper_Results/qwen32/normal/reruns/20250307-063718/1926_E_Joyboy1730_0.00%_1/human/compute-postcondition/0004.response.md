To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variable `n` since it is the only variable present in the loop condition `while n:`.

The loop will execute if `n` is truthy, which means `n` must be a non-zero value. Given the constraints, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Since `n` is already within this range, it will always be truthy and the loop will execute as long as it's not explicitly set to zero.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes the first time. The state right before the loop can remain as is.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list.**
