Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in `tot`.**
