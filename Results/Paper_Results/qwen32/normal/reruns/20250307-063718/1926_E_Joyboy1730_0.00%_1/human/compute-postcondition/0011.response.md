The given code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` was originally defined as `(original n + 1) // 2`, the reassignment does not change the value of `m` because the expression used for the reassignment is the same as the original definition.

Therefore, the value of `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
