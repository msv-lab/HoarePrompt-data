The value of `n` is decreased by `m`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is (n + 1) // 2.**
