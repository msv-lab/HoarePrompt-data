Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is set to 0.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\). Since `n` is 0, `k` must also be 0 (the only integer that satisfies \(1 \leq k \leq 0\) is not possible, so we assume `k` is 0 for the sake of logical consistency).
   - `L` is a list with at least one element (the exact elements are not specified).
   - `tot` is less than `k`. Since `k` is 0, `tot` must be less than 0, but the exact value of `tot` is not specified.
   - `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. This condition is not relevant to the print statement and does not affect the output.
   - `pow` is set to 1.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.
   - We know `pow` is 1.
   - We know `k` is 0.
   - Substituting the known values into the expression, we get:
     \[
     \text{pow} \times (2 \times k - 1) = 1 \times (2 \times 0 - 1) = 1 \times (-1) = -1
     \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be \(-1\).

Output: **-1**
