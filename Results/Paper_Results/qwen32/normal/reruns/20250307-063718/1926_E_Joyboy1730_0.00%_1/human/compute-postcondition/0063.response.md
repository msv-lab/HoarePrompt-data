To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and how the variables are defined and manipulated.

### Initial State and Variable Descriptions:
- `t`: An integer input such that \(0 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 - 1\).
- `n`: Explicitly set to 0.
- `k`: Defined as `k - tot`. This implies that `k` is initially some value, and then it is modified by subtracting `tot` from it.
- `L`: A list with at least one element.
- `pow`: Initially defined as `2 * pow`. This means `pow` is initially some value, and then it is doubled.
- `tot`: Initially defined as `tot + a`. This means `tot` is initially some value, and then `a` (the next element in `L`) is added to it.
- `a`: The next element in `L`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `k`, `pow`, and `tot` are defined in terms of previous values and `a` (the next element in `L`).

2. **Modifications**:
   - `k` is modified to `k - tot`.
   - `pow` is modified to `2 * pow`.
   - `tot` is modified to `tot + a`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state, we do not have explicit values for `k`, `pow`, and `tot`. However, we can express the output in terms of these variables and `a` (the next element in `L`).

- Initially, `pow` is doubled, so if `pow` was `x` before the modification, it is now `2 * x`.
- `k` is modified to `k - tot`.
- `tot` is modified to `tot + a`.

The print statement will output:
\[ \text{Output} = \text{pow} \times (2 \times \text{k} - 1) \]

Since the exact values of `pow` and `k` are not provided, we express the output in terms of these variables and `a`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **pow * (2 * k - 1) (where pow is 2 * pow before the modification, k is k - tot, and tot is tot + a)**
