The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, which is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**
