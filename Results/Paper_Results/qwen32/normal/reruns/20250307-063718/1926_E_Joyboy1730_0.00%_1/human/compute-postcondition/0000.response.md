The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer provided by the input, and the constraints on `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**
