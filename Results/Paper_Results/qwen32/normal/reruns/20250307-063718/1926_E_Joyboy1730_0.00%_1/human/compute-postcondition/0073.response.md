Output State: **`a` is the next element in `L`; `tot` is increased by `a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state.**

Natural language: The value of `tot` is now the sum of its previous value and `a`. The element `a` remains the next element in the list `L`. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement still holds as described: if `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the new value of `tot` (which is the old value of `tot` plus `a`), the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no other changes occur.
