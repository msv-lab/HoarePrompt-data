Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, no change is made to `tot`.**
