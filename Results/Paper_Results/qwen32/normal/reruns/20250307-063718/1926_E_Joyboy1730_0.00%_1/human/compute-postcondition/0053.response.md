The code snippet `pow = 1` simply assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `pow`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**
