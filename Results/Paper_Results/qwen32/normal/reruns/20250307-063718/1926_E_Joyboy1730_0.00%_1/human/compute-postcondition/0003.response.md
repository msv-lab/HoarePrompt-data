Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `L` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
