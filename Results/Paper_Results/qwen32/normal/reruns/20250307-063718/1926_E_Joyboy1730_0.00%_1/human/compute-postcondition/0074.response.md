The value of `k` is decreased by `tot`. The values of `a`, the fact that `a` is the next element in `L`, and the condition that `tot` is increased by `a` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (`if tot < k and k <= tot + a`) is also unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `L`; `tot` is increased by `a`; `k` is decreased by `tot`.**
