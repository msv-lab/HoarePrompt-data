The code snippet provided is `pow *= 2`, which means the value of `pow` is multiplied by 2. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k - tot`.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is 2.
- `tot` is increased by `a` twice, where `a` is `L[1]`.
- `k` is now `k - tot`.
- If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` changes from 2 to 4. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is increased by `a` twice, `a` is `L[1]`, and `k` is now `k - tot`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
