Postcondition: **`t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is now `2 * pow`, `tot` is now `tot + a`, and `a` is the next element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
