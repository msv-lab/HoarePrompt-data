The code snippet `L = []` reassigns the list `L` to be an empty list. This means that all the elements that were previously in `L` are removed, and `L` now contains no elements. As a result, `tot`, which was the sum of all elements in `L`, will now be 0 because the list is empty. Similarly, `pow`, which was previously `2^len(L)`, will now be `2^0`, which is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**
