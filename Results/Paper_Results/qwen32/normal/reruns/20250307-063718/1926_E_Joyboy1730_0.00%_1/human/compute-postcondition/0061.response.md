The code snippet `pow *= 2` doubles the value of the variable `pow`. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * `pow`, `tot` is `tot` + `a`.**
