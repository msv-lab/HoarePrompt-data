The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1, and if `tot` was less than `k` and `k` was less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `tot` is now `tot + a`.**
