Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In simpler terms, `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` has been updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` retains its value as an input integer, `L` remains an empty list, and `m` is still calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
