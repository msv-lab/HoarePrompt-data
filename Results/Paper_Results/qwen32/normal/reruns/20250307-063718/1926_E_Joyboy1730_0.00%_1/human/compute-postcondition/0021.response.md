The code snippet provided is `tot += a`, which means the value of `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state regarding `tot` and `k` do not affect the execution of this line of code directly, as they are only relevant for conditional checks that are not present here. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `tot`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1, and `tot` is increased by `a`.**
