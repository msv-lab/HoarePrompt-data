The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `pow` by multiplying it by 2. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `L`, `tot`, `a`, `k`) are affected by this operation.

Initial State: `t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * `pow`, `tot` is `tot` + `a`, `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `k` is `k` - `tot`.

After the operation `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` is now double its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * (2 * `pow`), `tot` is `tot` + `a`, `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `k` is `k` - `tot`.**
