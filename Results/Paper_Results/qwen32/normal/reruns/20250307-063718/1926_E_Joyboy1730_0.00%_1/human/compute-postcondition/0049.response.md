The given code snippet only contains the assignment `m = (n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is initially 1, the value of `m` will be calculated as `(1 + 1) // 2`, which equals `1`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect this change in the value of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 1**.
