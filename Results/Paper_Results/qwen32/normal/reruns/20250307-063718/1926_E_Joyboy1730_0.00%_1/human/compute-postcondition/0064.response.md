Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2 * `pow`, `tot` is `tot` + `a`, `a` is the next element in `L` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `a` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The only change is that the execution flow breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
