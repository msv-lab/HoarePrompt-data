Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is (n + 1) // 2.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `L` maintain their initial values. The variable `m` is newly assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`.
