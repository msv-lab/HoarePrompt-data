The value of `k` is decremented by the value of `tot`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1, and if `tot` was less than `k` and `k` was less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `tot` is now `tot + a`.
