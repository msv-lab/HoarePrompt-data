In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. Since `t` is already within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**. 

No further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state is already sufficient for the loop to run `t` times.
