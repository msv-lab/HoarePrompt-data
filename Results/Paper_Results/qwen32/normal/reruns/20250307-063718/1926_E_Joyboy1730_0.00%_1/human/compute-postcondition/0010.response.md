The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decremented by `(n + 1) // 2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after this decrement.

Let's analyze the decrement operation:
- `n` is decremented by `(n + 1) // 2`
- This means the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, after this decrement, `n` should still be greater than 0. This implies that before the decrement, `n` should be such that after subtracting `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains greater than 0.

To ensure this, `n` should be at least 2 because:
- If `n` is 2, `(n + 1) // 2` is 1, and `n - 1` is 1, which is greater than 0.
- If `n` is 1, `(n + 1) // 2` is 1, and `n - 1` is 0, which means the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 before the decrement operation.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `L` is an empty list, `m` is (original `n` + 1) // 2**
