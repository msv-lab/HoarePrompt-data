Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is the value after the previous iteration, `a` is `L[2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the innermost loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `a` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
