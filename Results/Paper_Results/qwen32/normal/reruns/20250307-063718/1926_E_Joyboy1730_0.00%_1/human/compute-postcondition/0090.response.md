The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `L`. Therefore, the values of `t` (which is decremented by 1 for each iteration, though the current value is not specified), `n` (which is 0), `k` (which is an input integer), and `L` (which is an empty list) remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `tot`, which is set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0.**
