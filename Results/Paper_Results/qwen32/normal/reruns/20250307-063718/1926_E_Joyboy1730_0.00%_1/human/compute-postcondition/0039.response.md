The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is a placeholder for the loop variable and is not used within the loop body. The loop executes `t` times, and the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, or `pow`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself, as it controls the number of iterations remaining.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `tot` at each iteration, `L` is a list of integers, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, and `pow` is 2^len(L)**

Since `t` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration, we adjust `t` as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4 - 1, `n` is 0, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `tot` at each iteration, `L` is a list of integers, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, and `pow` is 2^len(L)**
