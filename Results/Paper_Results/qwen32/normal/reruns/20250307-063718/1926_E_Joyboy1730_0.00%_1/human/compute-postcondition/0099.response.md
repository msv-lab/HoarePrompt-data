The code snippet provided is `pow *= 2`, which means the value of `pow` is doubled. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `pow` is now twice its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is now `2 * pow`, and if `tot` was less than `k` and `k` was less than or equal to `tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `tot` is now `tot + a`.**
