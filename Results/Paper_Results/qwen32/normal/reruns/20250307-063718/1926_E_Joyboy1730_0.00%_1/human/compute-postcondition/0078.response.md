The code snippet assigns the values from `input().split()` to `n` and `k` after converting them to integers. The initial state mentions that `t` is decremented by 1, but since `t` is not used or modified in the provided code snippet, its value remains as it was after being decremented.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
