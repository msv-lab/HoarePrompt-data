Postcondition: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot - tot`, `L` is a list with at least two elements, `pow` is `4 * pow`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
