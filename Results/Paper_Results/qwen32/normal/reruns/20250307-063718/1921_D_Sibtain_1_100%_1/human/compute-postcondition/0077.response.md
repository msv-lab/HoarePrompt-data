To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **`n` and `m`**: Integers retrieved from the input.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
4. **`c`**: A new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
5. **`i`**: The number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`.
6. **`j`**: The number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
7. **`ans`**: The sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.

### Variables and Their Roles:
- **`t`**: Represents the number of iterations or test cases.
- **`n`** and **`m`**: Typically represent the sizes of lists `a` and `c` respectively.
- **`a`**: A sorted list in ascending order.
- **`c`**: A sorted list in descending order.
- **`i`** and **`j`**: Counters for certain conditions during iterations.
- **`ans`**: Accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences over all iterations.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is described as the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration. This suggests that in each iteration, there is some comparison or calculation involving elements from `a` and `c`, and the maximum absolute difference from these comparisons is added to `ans`.

### Output Determination:
Given that `ans` is the final accumulated sum of maximum absolute differences, the output of `print(ans)` will be the value of `ans` after all iterations are completed.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c`, and the number of iterations `t` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the information provided, we can describe what `ans` represents.

### Final Answer:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration)**
