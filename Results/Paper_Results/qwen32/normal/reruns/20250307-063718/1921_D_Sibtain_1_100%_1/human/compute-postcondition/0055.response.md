Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0]); `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t2` is now calculated as the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
