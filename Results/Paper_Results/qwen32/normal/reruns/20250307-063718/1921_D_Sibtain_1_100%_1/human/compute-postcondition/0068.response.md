Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is `len(a)`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the sum of the two maximum absolute differences (`t1` and `t2`). All other variables remain unchanged.
