The code snippet provided is `i += 1`, which increments the value of `i` by 1. However, based on the initial state, `i` is not mentioned as an existing variable. Therefore, we can infer that `i` is being introduced and initialized to 1 by this operation.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 2; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` where `i` is 0 if `t2` was initially greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is 3 if `t2` was initially greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is 1; `i` is 1.**
