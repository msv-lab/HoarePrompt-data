The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` increases the value of `ans` by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`; `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.**
