The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`.
- `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is either 1 or 3.
- If `t2 > t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 2, and `j` is either 2 or 4; otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 3.

The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + max(t1, t2)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is either 1 or 3; if `t2 > t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 2, and `j` is either 2 or 4; otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 3.**
