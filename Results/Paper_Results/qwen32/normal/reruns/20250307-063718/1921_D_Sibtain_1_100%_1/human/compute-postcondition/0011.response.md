Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State and Code Analysis

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space (These variables are not used in the provided code snippet, so they can be ignored for this specific print statement).
   - `a`: A sorted list of integers with only one unique element. Since `a` is sorted and contains only one unique element, `a[0]` will be this unique element.
   - `c`: A list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))`

   Let's break down this expression:
   - `a[0]`: Since `a` is a list with only one unique element, `a[0]` is this unique element.
   - `max(c)`: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c`.
   - `min(c)`: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is the last element of `c`.
   - `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: This is the absolute difference between the unique element in `a` and the largest element in `c`.
   - `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: This is the absolute difference between the unique element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.
   - `max(...)`: This will return the larger of the two absolute differences calculated above.

### Output Calculation

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output the larger of the absolute differences between the unique element in `a` and the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

Let's denote:
- `unique_a` as the unique element in `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).
- `largest_c` as the largest element in `c` (i.e., `max(c)`).
- `smallest_c` as the smallest element in `c` (i.e., `min(c)`).

The output will be:
```
max(abs(unique_a - largest_c), abs(unique_a - smallest_c))
```

### Final Output

Output: **max(abs(unique_a - largest_c), abs(unique_a - smallest_c)) (where unique_a is the unique element in the list `a`, largest_c is the largest element in the list `c`, and smallest_c is the smallest element in the list `c`)**
