Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains only one unique element if the length of `a` is 1; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`; `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` remains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` where `i` is 0 if `t2` was greater than `t1` else `i` is 1; `t2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` is the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` plus the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` (not recalculated in this snippet); `k` remains incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1 if `t2` is not greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is incremented by 1.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2`; `k` is incremented by 1; if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is less than the length of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
