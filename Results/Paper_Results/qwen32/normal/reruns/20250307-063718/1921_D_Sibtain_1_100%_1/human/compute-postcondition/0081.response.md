The given code snippet updates the list `c` by reading a new set of integers from the input and converting them into a list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration. `c` is now a list of integers read from the input.**
