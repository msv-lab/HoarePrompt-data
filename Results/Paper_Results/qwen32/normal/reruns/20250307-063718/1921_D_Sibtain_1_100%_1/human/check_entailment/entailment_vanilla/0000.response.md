Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) between Petya's array \(a\) and Vasya's array \(c\). Vasya can choose any \(n\) elements from his array \(b\) and arrange them in any order to form \(c\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the sizes of arrays \(n\) and \(m\), the array \(a\) of size \(n\), and the array \(b\) of size \(m\).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) contain the same single element, the maximum difference \(D\) is 0.
   - If \(n = 1\), the program computes the maximum difference by comparing the single element of \(a\) with the maximum and minimum elements of \(b\).

3. **General Case**:
   - The arrays \(a\) and \(b\) are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively.
   - The program then iterates through the elements of \(a\) and \(b\) to maximize the differences:
     - It keeps two pointers, `i` for the smallest elements of \(a\) and `j` for the largest elements of \(b\).
     - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the potential differences:
       - \(t1 = |a[i] - b[i]|\)
       - \(t2 = |a[n-j] - b[m-j]|\)
     - It adds the maximum of these two differences to the total difference \(D\).
     - It increments the pointer corresponding to the larger difference.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - When both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) contain the same single element, the program correctly outputs 0.
  - When \(n = 1\), the program correctly computes the maximum difference by comparing the single element with the extremes of \(b\).

- **General Case**:
  - Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(b\) in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered.
  - The two-pointer technique ensures that the program efficiently finds the maximum possible difference for each element of \(a\).
  - The logic of comparing and choosing the larger difference between the smallest and largest elements is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\) between the arrays \(a\) and \(c\).

Correctness: **True**
