Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0]); `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]); `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
