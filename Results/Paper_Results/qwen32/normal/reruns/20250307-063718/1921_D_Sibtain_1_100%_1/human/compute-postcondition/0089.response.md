Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration. If the length of `a` is 1, the condition checks if all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the single element in `a` is equal to the single element in `c`. If this condition is met, no further changes are specified; otherwise, no further changes are specified. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, no changes are specified based on the given information.**
