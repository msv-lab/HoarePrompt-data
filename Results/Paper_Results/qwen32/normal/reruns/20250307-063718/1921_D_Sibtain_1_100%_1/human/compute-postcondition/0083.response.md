The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and no loop is shown, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state provided.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.**
