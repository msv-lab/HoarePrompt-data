### Reasoning:
The given problem requires maximizing the sum of absolute differences between two arrays, `a` and `c`, where `c` is formed by selecting `n` integers from `b` and arranging them in any order. The strategy to maximize the difference is to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - If both `a` and `b` have all identical elements and they are the same, the maximum difference `D` is `0` because all differences will be `0`.
   - If `n` is `1`, the program calculates the maximum difference by pairing the single element of `a` with the maximum and minimum elements of `b`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order and renamed to `c` for clarity.

4. **Greedy Pairing**:
   - The program initializes pointers `i` and `j` to `0` and `1` respectively, and a variable `ans` to accumulate the total difference.
   - It iterates over the elements of `a` and `c`:
     - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute differences between the current smallest and largest unpaired elements of `a` and `c`.
     - It selects the larger difference and adds it to `ans`.
     - It updates the pointers `i` and `j` accordingly to point to the next smallest or largest elements.

5. **Output**: The program prints the accumulated total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
The greedy approach used in the program is correct because it ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered at each step, leading to the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of absolute differences between the two arrays.

**Correctness: True**
