To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the logic that computes the value of `ans`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `i` and `j` are counters for the number of times the first and last parts of `a` were used in the comparison, respectively.
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic.

The variable `ans` is computed based on the loop logic, which involves comparing elements of `a` and `c` to find the maximum absolute differences and summing them up. However, the exact loop logic is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can describe `ans` in terms of the process it undergoes.

The loop logic typically involves iterating over the elements of `a` and `c`, comparing them, and accumulating the maximum absolute differences. If the loop logic is not explicitly provided, we can only describe `ans` as the result of this process.

Given the information, the `print(ans)` statement will print the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic)**
