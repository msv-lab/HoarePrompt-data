The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the last elements of the lists `a` and `c` and assigns it to the variable `t2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `k` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `c[len(c) - 1]`.**
