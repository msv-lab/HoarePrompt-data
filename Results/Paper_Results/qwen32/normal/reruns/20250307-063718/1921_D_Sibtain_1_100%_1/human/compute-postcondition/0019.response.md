Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `ans` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`; `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`; the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` (t2) is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` (t1).**

The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
