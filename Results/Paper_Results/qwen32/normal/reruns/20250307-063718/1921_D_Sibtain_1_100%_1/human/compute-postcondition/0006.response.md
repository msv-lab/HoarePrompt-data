Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` and `c` are both lists of integers obtained from the input; both `a` and `c` contain only one unique element, and the unique element in `a` is equal to the unique element in `c`.**

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no impact on the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
