Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `c[len(c) - 1]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
