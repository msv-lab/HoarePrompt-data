The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in descending order, and assigns this value to the variable `t1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `k` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`.**
