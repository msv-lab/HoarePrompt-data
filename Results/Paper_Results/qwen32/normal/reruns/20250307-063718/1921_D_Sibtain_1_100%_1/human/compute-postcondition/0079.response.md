The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.**
