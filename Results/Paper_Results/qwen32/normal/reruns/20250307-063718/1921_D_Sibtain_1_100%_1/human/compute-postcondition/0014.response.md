Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains only one unique element if the length of `a` is 1; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.**

This means that the variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been initialized to 0, 1, and 0, respectively. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
