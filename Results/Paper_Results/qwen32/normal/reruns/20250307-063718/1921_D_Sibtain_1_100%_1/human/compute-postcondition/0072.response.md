The code snippet provided increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that `j` is either 1 or 3, after the increment, `j` will be either 2 or 4. However, since `j` is used in the calculation of `t2` where `j` is either 1 or 3, the incremented value of `j` will not be valid for the subsequent calculations as per the conditions described. Nonetheless, based on the provided code snippet, we will update `j` accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is either 1 or 3; `i` is either 0 or 2 based on the previous condition; `j` is either 2 or 4.**
