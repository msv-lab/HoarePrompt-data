Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values provided by the input, with `n` being the first integer and `m` being the second integer separated by a space.
