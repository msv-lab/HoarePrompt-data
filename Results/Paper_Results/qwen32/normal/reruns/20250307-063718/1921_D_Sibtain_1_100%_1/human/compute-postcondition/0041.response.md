The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times the first part of `a` was used in the comparison; `j` is the number of times the last part of `a` was used in the comparison; `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
