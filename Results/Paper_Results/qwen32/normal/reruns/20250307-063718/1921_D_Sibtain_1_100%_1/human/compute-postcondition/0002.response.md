The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
