Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` and `c` are lists of integers obtained from the input. If both `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and the unique element in `a` is equal to the unique element in `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
