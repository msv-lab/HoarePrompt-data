Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` remains the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` plus the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` (not recalculated in this snippet); `k` is incremented by 1; if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is less than the length of `a`.**
