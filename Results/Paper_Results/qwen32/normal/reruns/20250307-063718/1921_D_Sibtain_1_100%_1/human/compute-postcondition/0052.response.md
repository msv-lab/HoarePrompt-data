The code snippet provided resets the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` to 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The initial states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.**
