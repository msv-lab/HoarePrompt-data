The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to the current value of `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `t1`, `t2`, `k`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2`; `k` is incremented by 1; if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is less than the length of `a`.**
