The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Given that the code snippet provided is just `continue`, and it is not inside a loop, it will have no effect on the program's state.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times the first part of `a` was used in the comparison; `j` is the number of times the last part of `a` was used in the comparison; `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal, then no further changes are made to `i`, `j`, or `ans`.**
