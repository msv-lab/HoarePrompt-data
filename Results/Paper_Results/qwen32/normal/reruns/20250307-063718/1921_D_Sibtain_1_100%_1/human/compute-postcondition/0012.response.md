Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains only one unique element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order. The length of `a` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables in this context. It would typically be used within a loop to skip the rest of the loop's code and proceed to the next iteration, but since there is no loop here, the state remains unchanged.
