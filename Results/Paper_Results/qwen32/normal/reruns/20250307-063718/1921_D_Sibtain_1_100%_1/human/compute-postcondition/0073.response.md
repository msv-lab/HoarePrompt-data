The code snippet provided only increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can either be 0 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 3.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is either 1 or 3; `i` is either 1 or 3.**
