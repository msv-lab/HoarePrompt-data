Given the initial state, we have the following variables and their descriptions:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, with `n` being the first integer and `m` the second integer separated by a space.
- `a` and `c` are both lists of integers obtained from the input, and both lists contain only one unique element. Additionally, the unique element in `a` is equal to the unique element in `c`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(0)
```

This print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`. It simply prints the integer `0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **0**
