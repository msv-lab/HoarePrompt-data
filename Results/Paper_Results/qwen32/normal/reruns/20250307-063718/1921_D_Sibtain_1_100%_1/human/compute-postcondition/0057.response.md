The code increments the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, the value of `j` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. The current value of `t2` is greater than the current value of `t1`.**
