Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input.
- `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `i` is the number of times `t1` was less than or equal to `t2`.
- `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.
- `c` is now a list of integers read from the input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement is straightforward. It prints the integer `0` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, or `ans`. The value to be printed is explicitly `0`.

### Output:
Output: **0**
