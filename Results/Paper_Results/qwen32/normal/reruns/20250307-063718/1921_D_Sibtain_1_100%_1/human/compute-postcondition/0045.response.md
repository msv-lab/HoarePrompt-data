The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and no loop context is given, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is the number of times the first part of `a` was used in the comparison; `j` is the number of times the last part of `a` was used in the comparison; `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic.**
