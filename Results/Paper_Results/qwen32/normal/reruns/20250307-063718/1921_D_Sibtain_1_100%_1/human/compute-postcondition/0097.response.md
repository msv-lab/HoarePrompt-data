Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `k` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `c[len(c) - 1]`; and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
