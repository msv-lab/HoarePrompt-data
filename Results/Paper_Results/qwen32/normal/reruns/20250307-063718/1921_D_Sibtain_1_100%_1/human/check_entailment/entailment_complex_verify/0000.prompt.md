You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: the output state you calculate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when paired optimally.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya wants to create an array `c` of length `n` using `n` integers from an array `b` of length `m` (where `m >= n`) to maximize the total difference `D = Σ |a[i] - c[i]|`, where `a` is Petya's array.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads `n` and `m`.
2. It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if all elements in `a` and `b` are the same. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero when all elements are identical.
4. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
5. It then calculates the maximum possible difference by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sorting and Pairing Logic**: The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. It then alternates between pairing the smallest remaining element of `a` with the largest remaining element of `b` and vice versa. This approach may not always yield the maximum difference.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program handles some edge cases, such as when all elements in `a` and `b` are the same. However, it doesn't explicitly handle other edge cases, such as when `n = 1` or when `a` or `b` contains duplicate elements.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with a few cases to see if it behaves as expected:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
4 6
6 1 2 4
3 5 1 7 2 3
```
Expected Output: `16`
The program should output `16` because it can choose `c = [1, 5, 7, 2]` leading to `D = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16`.

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
3 4
1 1 1
1 1 1 1
```
Expected Output: `0`
The program should output `0` because all elements are the same.

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
Expected Output: `12`
The program should output `12` because it can choose `c = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` leading to `D = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12`.

#### Test Case 4:
```
1
2 6
5 8
8 7 5 8 2 10
```
Expected Output: `11`
The program should output `11` because it can choose `c = [10, 2]` leading to `D = 5 + 6 = 11`.

#### Test Case 5:
```
1
2 2
4 1
9 6
```
Expected Output: `11`
The program should output `11` because it can choose `c = [9, 6]` leading to `D = 5 + 5 = 10`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided test cases correctly. However, the logic of alternating between the smallest and largest elements may not always yield the optimal solution. For example, consider the following test case:

#### Test Case 6:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
Expected Output: `6`
The program should output `6` because it can choose `c = [3, 2, 1]` leading to `D = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`. However, the optimal solution is `D = 6` by choosing `c = [3, 1, 2]` leading to `D = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.

### Final Answer:
The program does not always yield the maximum difference `D` as required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
