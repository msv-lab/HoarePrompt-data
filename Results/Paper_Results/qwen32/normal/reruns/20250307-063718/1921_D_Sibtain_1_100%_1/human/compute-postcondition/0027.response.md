The code snippet provided only increments the variable `j` by 1. Therefore, the value of `j` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` remains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` where `i` is 0 if `t2` was greater than `t1` else `i` is 1; `t2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` remains the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` (not recalculated in this snippet); `k` remains incremented by 1; `j` is incremented by 1.**
