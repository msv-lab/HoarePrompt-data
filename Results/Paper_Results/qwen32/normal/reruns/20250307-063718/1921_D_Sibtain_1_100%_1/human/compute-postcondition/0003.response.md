The code provided assigns a new list `c` to the variable `c`, which is created by mapping the input string (split into parts) to integers. This means `c` will now hold a list of integers obtained from the input.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `m`, we will keep them as they are. The list `a` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
