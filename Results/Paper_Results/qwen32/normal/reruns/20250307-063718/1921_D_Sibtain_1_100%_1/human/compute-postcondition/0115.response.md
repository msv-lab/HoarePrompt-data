To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context around the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` and `j` depend on the specific values of `a` and `c` and the comparisons made during the loop.

### Key Points:
- The variable `ans` is crucial for the output and is defined as the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration. However, the exact values of `t1` and `t2` are not explicitly provided in the initial state.
- The lists `a` and `c` are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively, which suggests that some form of comparison or pairing might be happening between elements of these lists.
- The value of `ans` is accumulated over multiple iterations, likely involving some loop that processes elements from `a` and `c`.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact loop logic and the specific values of `t1` and `t2`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` precisely in terms of the process that generates it.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the accumulated sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, where `t1` and `t2` are likely derived from elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration, with t1 and t2 derived from elements of the sorted lists a and c)**
