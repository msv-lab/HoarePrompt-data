The code snippet assigns specific values to the variables `i`, `j`, and `ans`. Before the execution, `i` and `j` were described in terms of conditions involving `t1` and `t2`, and `ans` was described as the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration. However, the provided code snippet directly assigns `i` to 0, `j` to 1, and `ans` to 0, overriding any previous values or conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.**
