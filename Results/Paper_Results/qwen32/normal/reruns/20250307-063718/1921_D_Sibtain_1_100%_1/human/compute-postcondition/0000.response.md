The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer because the loop will iterate `int(input())` times. 

In the context of the provided state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, which indicates that `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute `t` times, once for each test case.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` retrieves the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `int(input())` retrieves the value of `t`**
