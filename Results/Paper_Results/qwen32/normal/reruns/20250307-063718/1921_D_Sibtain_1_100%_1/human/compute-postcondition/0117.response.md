Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is the length of list `b`. It also accepts two lists `a` and `b` containing `n` and `m` integers respectively. The function processes these inputs and returns some output for each test case.**
