Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains only one unique element if the length of `a` is 1; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1, no changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `c` unless the condition of having a single unique element in both `a` and `c` is satisfied, in which case no further changes are specified. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
