Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` remain the integers retrieved from the input; `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `t1` remains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` where `i` is 0 if `t2` was greater than `t1` else `i` is 1; `t2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`; `ans` is the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` plus the maximum of the original `t1` and the original `t2` (not recalculated in this snippet); `k` remains incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1 if `t2` is not greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is incremented by 1.`**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by the maximum of the original `t1` and `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state, except for `ans` which has been updated.
