The only variable in the loop head is `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `k` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 2; `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`; `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` was initially greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**
