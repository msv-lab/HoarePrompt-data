The code snippet sorts the list `c` in descending order. This change affects the list `c` but does not affect any other variables. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers retrieved from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times the first part of `a` was used in the comparison; `j` is the number of times the last part of `a` was used in the comparison; `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as defined by the loop logic. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal, then no further changes are made to `i`, `j`, or `ans`.**
