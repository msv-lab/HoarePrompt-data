The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer separated by a space; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`; `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`; and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**
