To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` function step by step.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers retrieved from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and contains at least one element.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `i` and `j` are counters related to the comparison logic (though they are not directly used in the print statement).
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

**Expression Inside the Print Statement:**
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))
```

Let's analyze the components:
1. `a[0]`: This is the first element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[0]` is the smallest element in `a`.

2. `max(c)`: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c`, which is the largest element in `c`.

3. `min(c)`: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is the last element of `c`, which is the smallest element in `c`.

4. `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: This calculates the absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `c`.

5. `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: This calculates the absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.

6. `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))`: This finds the maximum of the two absolute differences calculated above.

**Output Description:**
The print statement will output the maximum of two absolute differences:
- The absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `c`.
- The absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list a, max(c) is the largest element in the sorted list c in descending order, and min(c) is the smallest element in the sorted list c in descending order)**
