Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. The variable `s` will be each of these lines starting from the second line. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the line `s` split and converted to integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. The variable `s` has been split into `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers derived from `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the split line `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
