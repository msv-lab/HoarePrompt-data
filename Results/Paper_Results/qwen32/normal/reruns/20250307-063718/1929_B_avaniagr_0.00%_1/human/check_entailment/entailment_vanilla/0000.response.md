To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the problem statement and the provided solution. The goal is to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Total Diagonals**: In an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. These diagonals can be categorized into two types:
   - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (including the main diagonal).
   - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (including the main diagonal).

2. **Minimum Colored Cells**:
   - If \( k \le 2n - 1 \), we can color cells in the main diagonals (both types) to ensure that \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \), which is achieved by coloring cells in the main diagonals.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to color cells in additional diagonals. The strategy is to color the main diagonals first and then color additional cells in other diagonals. The formula becomes more complex, but the provided program seems to handle this case by coloring \( 2n \) cells when \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program uses a conditional expression to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 4n - 3 \):

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the expression:

- **When \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
  - The expression evaluates to \( (k // 2 + k \% 2) \), which is \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \). This is correct for \( k \le 2n - 1 \) because we only need to color cells in the main diagonals.
  
- **When \( k \ge 4n - 3 \)**:
  - The expression evaluates to \( 2n \) when \( k \ge 4n - 3 \). This is correct because we need to color all cells in the main diagonals and possibly some additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals.
  
- **When \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
  - The expression adds an extra 1 to the result, which is correct because the last diagonal needs an additional cell to be covered.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles the different cases based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 4n - 3 \). It correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color in the grid to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
