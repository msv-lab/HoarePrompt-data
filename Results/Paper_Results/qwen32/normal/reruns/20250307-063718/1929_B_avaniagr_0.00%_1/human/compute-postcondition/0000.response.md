The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`. According to the code, the loop will execute for each line in the input starting from the second line (index 1). Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that the input has at least two lines (the first line being the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent lines being the test cases themselves).

State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. The variable `s` will be each of these lines starting from the second line.**
