Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. The variable `s` will be each of these lines starting from the second line. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the line `s` split and converted to integers.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `k` are now specific integers extracted from the string `s`, where `n` is the size of the square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
