#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The function has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. The state of variables `t`, `n`, and `k` from the last iteration remains in memory, but they are not relevant to the overall output state since the function's output is the printed results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a square grid `n` and a minimum number of diagonals `k` that should have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition specified by `k`.
