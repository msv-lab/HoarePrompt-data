You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a square grid `n` and a minimum number of diagonals `k` that should have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition specified by `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell in an `n x n` grid.

### Analysis of the Program

The program given is:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the logic of the code:
- The program iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then computes the minimum number of cells to color using the formula:
  \[
  \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
  \]
- Finally, it prints the result.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. Let's analyze the formula provided:

1. **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**
   - The formula simplifies to \( \text{result} = k // 2 + k \% 2 \).
   - This means that for each pair of diagonals, we color one cell, and if there is an odd number of diagonals, we color one more cell.

2. **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**
   - The formula simplifies to \( \text{result} = 2 * n \).
   - This means that we need to color all cells in two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal) to cover all diagonals.

3. **Case 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
   - The formula adds an additional 1 to the result when \( k = 4n - 2 \).
   - This is to ensure that the last diagonal is covered.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases:

1. **Example 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - \( 4 < 4*3 - 3 = 9 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 4 // 2 + 4 \% 2 = 2 + 0 = 2 \)
   - Correct.

2. **Example 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - \( 3 < 9 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - Correct.

3. **Example 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - \( 10 \geq 9 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 2 * 3 = 6 \)
   - Correct.

4. **Example 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
   - \( 9 \geq 9 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 2 * 3 = 6 \)
   - But the correct answer is 5 (coloring cells in the main diagonal and one more cell in the anti-diagonal).
   - Incorrect.

5. **Example 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
   - \( 7 < 4*4 - 3 = 13 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 7 // 2 + 7 \% 2 = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
   - Correct.

6. **Example 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
   - \( 11 < 4*7 - 3 = 25 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 11 // 2 + 11 \% 2 = 5 + 1 = 6 \)
   - Correct.

7. **Example 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
   - \( 3 \geq 4*2 - 3 = 5 \)
   - \( \text{result} = 2 * 2 = 4 \)
   - But the correct answer is 2 (coloring cells in the main diagonal and one more cell in the anti-diagonal).
   - Incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle the cases where \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 3 \) correctly. Specifically, it overestimates the number of cells needed when \( k \) is close to but less than \( 4n - 3 \), and it overestimates when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
