The code snippet provided reads a line of input `s` and splits it into two integers `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, `s` is the next line from the input, which contains two integers separated by a space. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the split line, and `s` is no longer needed for further processing.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and the input must have at least `t + 1` lines where each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the split line `s`.**
