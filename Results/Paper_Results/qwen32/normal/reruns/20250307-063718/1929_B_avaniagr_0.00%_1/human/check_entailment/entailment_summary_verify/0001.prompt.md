You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a square grid `n` and a minimum number of diagonals `k` that should have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition specified by `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the problem statement and the provided solution. The goal is to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Total Diagonals**: In an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. These diagonals can be categorized into two types:
   - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (including the main diagonal).
   - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (including the main diagonal).

2. **Minimum Colored Cells**:
   - If \( k \le 2n - 1 \), we can color cells in the main diagonals (both types) to ensure that \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \), which is achieved by coloring cells in the main diagonals.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to color cells in additional diagonals. The strategy is to color the main diagonals first and then color additional cells in other diagonals. The formula becomes more complex, but the provided program seems to handle this case by coloring \( 2n \) cells when \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program uses a conditional expression to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 4n - 3 \):

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the expression:

- **When \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
  - The expression evaluates to \( (k // 2 + k \% 2) \), which is \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \). This is correct for \( k \le 2n - 1 \) because we only need to color cells in the main diagonals.
  
- **When \( k \ge 4n - 3 \)**:
  - The expression evaluates to \( 2n \) when \( k \ge 4n - 3 \). This is correct because we need to color all cells in the main diagonals and possibly some additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals.
  
- **When \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
  - The expression adds an extra 1 to the result, which is correct because the last diagonal needs an additional cell to be covered.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles the different cases based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 4n - 3 \). It correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color in the grid to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
