After the loop has executed all its iterations, the function has processed all the test cases specified by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`, computes the result based on the provided formula, and prints the result. The loop iterates `t` times, once for each test case.

Here's the final output state in the requested format:

Output State: **The function has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. The state of variables `t`, `n`, and `k` from the last iteration remains in memory, but they are not relevant to the overall output state since the function's output is the printed results.**

In simpler terms: The function has finished processing all test cases and has printed the results for each one. The specific values of `n` and `k` from the last test case are still stored, but the overall output is the series of printed results for each test case.
