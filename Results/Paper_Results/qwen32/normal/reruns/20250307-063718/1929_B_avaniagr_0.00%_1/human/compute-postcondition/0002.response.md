To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. We'll break it down step-by-step.

### Breakdown of the Expression

1. **Term 1: `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`**
   - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - `k % 2` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2)` will be:
     - `k // 2 + 0` if `k` is even, which equals `k // 2`.
     - `k // 2 + 1` if `k` is odd, which equals `(k + 1) // 2` (the ceiling of `k / 2`).
   - `(k < 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to `1` if true and `0` if false.
   - This term will be `(k // 2 + k % 2)` if `k < 4 * n - 3` and `0` otherwise.

2. **Term 2: `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`**
   - `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to `1` if true and `0` if false.
   - This term will be `2 * n` if `k >= 4 * n - 3` and `0` otherwise.

3. **Term 3: `(k == 4 * n - 2)`**
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to `1` if true and `0` if false.
   - This term will be `1` if `k == 4 * n - 2` and `0` otherwise.

### Combining the Terms

The overall expression combines these terms:
- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the first term is `(k // 2 + k % 2)` and the other two terms are `0`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 3`, the first term is `0`, the second term is `2 * n`, and the third term is `0`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the first term is `0`, the second term is `2 * n`, and the third term is `1`.
- If `k > 4 * n - 2`, the first term is `0`, the second term is `2 * n`, and the third term is `0`.

### Final Output

The final output depends on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 3`:
- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the output is `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, which is the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n + 1`.
- If `k > 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.

### Conclusion

The print statement will output a value based on the relationship between `k` and `4 * n - 3` as described above.

Output: **The output is `(k // 2 + k % 2)` if `k < 4 * n - 3`, `2 * n` if `k == 4 * n - 3`, `2 * n + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, and `2 * n` if `k > 4 * n - 2`.**
