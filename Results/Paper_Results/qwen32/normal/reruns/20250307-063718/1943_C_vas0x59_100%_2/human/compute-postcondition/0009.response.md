The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This means the initial values of `u` and `v` (which were the first and second integers from the input minus 1) are now replaced by the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v`, the list at index `v` contains `u` twice, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input.**
