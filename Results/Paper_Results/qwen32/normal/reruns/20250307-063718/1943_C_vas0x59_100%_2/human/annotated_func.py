#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the input, constructs the adjacency list `u2vs`, and then determines the longest path in the tree. It calculates a series of operations based on the middle node(s) of this longest path and prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves. Each operation is a tuple indicating a node and a distance, with node indices adjusted to be 1-indexed. The function returns `None`.
