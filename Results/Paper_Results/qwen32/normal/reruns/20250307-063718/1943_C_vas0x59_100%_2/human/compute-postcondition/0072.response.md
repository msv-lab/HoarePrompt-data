To determine the output of the provided print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the logic described for the variables and objects involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `u2vs`: A list of `n` lists where each sublist contains indices `j` such that there is a connection between index `i` and `j`.
- `d`: A list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function.
- `a`: Result of `func_1(d)`. (The exact nature of `func_1` is not specified, but it's not used in the print statement.)
- `previous`: A list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j`.
- `b`: Result of `func_1(d)`. (Same as `a`, `func_1` is not specified.)
- `path_ba`: A list containing `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path.
- `n`: `-1` indicating the end of the loop.
- `ops`: A list of tuples that depends on the length of `path_ba`.

### Determining `path_ba`:
- `path_ba` is constructed by starting from `b` and following the `previous` list to node `0`.

### Determining `ops`:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by `2`, and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` contains tuples `(path_ba[ci1], 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(path_ba[ci1], 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(path_ba[ci1], 2k - 3)`, and `(c2, 2k - 3)`, where `ci2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by `2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The print statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
- The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0] + 1, x[1])` into a string.
- The `sep='\n'` argument in `print` ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

### Output Determination:
- The output will be a series of strings, each representing a tuple in `ops` with the first element incremented by 1.
- The exact values depend on the construction of `path_ba` and the resulting `ops`.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume `path_ba` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]` (even length).
- `ci2 = 2`, `ci1 = 1`, `c1 = 2`, `c2 = 1`.
- `ops` would be `[(2, 1), (1, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3)]`.
- The print statement would output:
  ```
  3 1
  2 1
  3 3
  2 3
  ```

### General Output:
Given the complexity and the dependency on the specific values of `path_ba`, we can describe the output in a general form:
- The output will be a series of formatted strings, each representing a tuple in `ops` with the first element incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **3 1\n2 1\n3 3\n2 3 (if path_ba is [3, 2, 1, 0])**
- This output is an example based on a specific `path_ba`. The actual output will depend on the actual `path_ba` constructed from the initial state.

Since we don't have the exact `path_ba`, we'll describe it in a general form:
Output: **Formatted tuples from ops with the first element incremented by 1**
