The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The list `u2vs` and its contents do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
