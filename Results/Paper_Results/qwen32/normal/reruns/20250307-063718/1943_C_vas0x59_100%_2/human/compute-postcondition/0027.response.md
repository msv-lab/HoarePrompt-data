The code snippet provided assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`. Therefore, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`. Consequently, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
