The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means `n` is being reassigned to the integer value of the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed).

Since the code reassigns `n` to the integer value of the input, the value of `n` changes to whatever integer is provided by the user. The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the input operation in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed); `n` is the integer value provided by the input.**
