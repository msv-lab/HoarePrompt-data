The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` already contains `u`, and all other lists are empty. After executing the code, the list at index `v` will contain `u` twice.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v`, the list at index `v` contains `u` twice, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
