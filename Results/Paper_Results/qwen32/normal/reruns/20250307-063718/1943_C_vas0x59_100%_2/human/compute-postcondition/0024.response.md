The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will now hold the same value as `a` since both `a` and `b` are assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
