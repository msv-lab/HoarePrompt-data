The code snippet provided initializes `u2vs` to be a list of `n` empty lists. Given that `u2vs` was previously a list of lists where each sublist contained integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, after executing the code, `u2vs` will be reset to a list of `n` empty lists, discarding any previous connections.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is the integer value provided by the input.**
