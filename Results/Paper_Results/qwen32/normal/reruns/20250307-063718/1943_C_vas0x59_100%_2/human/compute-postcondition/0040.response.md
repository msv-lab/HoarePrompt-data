Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`. `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and `n`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described.**
