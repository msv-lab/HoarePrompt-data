To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the loop's behavior:

The loop runs `n - 1` times. In each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `u` and `v`, decrements each by 1, and appends the decremented `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs` and appends the decremented `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can observe the following pattern:
- After 1 iteration, the list at index `u` contains `v` once, and the list at index `v` contains `u` once.
- After 2 iterations, the list at index `u` contains `v` twice, and the list at index `v` contains `u` twice.
- After 3 iterations, the list at index `u` contains `v` three times, and the list at index `v` contains `u` three times.

Following this pattern, after `n - 1` iterations, each pair `(u, v)` will have been processed, and each list in `u2vs` will contain the indices of the nodes it is connected to, with each connection appearing exactly once in each respective list.

Therefore, the final output state after all `n - 1` iterations will be:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`.

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node points to all the nodes it is directly connected to.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`.**
