The code snippet `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains the single element `b`. After appending `n` to `path_ba`, `path_ba` will now contain two elements: `b` and `n`.

Here is the updated state:
- `u2vs` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- `d` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- `a` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- `previous` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- `b` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- `path_ba` now contains `b` and `n`.
- `n` remains the same as it was not changed by the code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is `-1`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
