Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`. `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path. The length of `path_ba` is odd. `n` is `-1` indicating the end of the loop. `ops` is an empty list. `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path with at least one element; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `n` is a non-negative integer (not necessarily -1); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which is at least 0; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path with at least one element; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `n` is a non-negative integer (not necessarily -1); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and possibly other tuples; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which is at least 0; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path with at least one element; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `n` is a non-negative integer (not necessarily -1); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` and possibly other tuples; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which is at least 0; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is incremented by 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
