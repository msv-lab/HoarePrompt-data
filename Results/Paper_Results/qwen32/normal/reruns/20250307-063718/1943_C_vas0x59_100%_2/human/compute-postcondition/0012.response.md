The code snippet `u2vs[u].append(v)` adds the value `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. 

Given the initial state, the list at index `u` already contains `v`. After executing the code, the list at index `u` will contain `v` twice.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v` twice, the list at index `v` contains `u` twice, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from the new input minus 1.**
