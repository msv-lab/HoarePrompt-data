Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`. `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path. `n` is `-1` indicating the end of the loop. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by `2`, and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(path_ba[ci1], 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(path_ba[ci1], 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(path_ba[ci1], 2k - 3)`, and `(c2, 2k - 3)`, where `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.**
