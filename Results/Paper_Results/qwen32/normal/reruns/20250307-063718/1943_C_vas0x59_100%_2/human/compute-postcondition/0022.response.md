To determine the Output State, let's break down the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables.

Initial State:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`.
- `d` is a list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph.

Code Snippet:
```
a = func_1(d)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code snippet calls a function named `func_1` with the argument `d`.
- The result of `func_1(d)` is assigned to the variable `a`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that `a` will hold whatever value `func_1(d)` returns. 

Thus, the Output State will include the original state of `u2vs` and `d`, with the addition of the new variable `a` holding the result of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is a list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
