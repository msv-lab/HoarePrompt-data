Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v` twice, the list at index `v` contains `u` three times, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from the new input minus 1.**

Explanation: The list at index `v` in `u2vs` originally contained `u` twice. After executing the code `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list at index `v` now contains `u` three times. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
