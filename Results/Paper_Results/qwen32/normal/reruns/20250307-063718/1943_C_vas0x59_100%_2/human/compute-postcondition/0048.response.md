The provided Python code snippet is `ops.append((c, i))`. This line of code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is a variable that should have been defined previously in the code (since it's being used in the tuple).

After executing the code, the new state of `ops` will be a list containing one tuple `(c, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the indices `j` such that there is a connection between `i` and `j`; `d` is the updated list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `j` contains the index of the node that precedes node `j` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `j` as computed by the `bfs` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and all the preceding nodes from `b` to `0` in the shortest path with at least one element; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `n` is a non-negative integer (not necessarily -1); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which is at least 0; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.**
