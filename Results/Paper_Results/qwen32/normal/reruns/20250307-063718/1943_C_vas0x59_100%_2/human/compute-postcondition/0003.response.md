`u` and `v` are assigned the values of the two integers obtained from the input, split and converted to integers. The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged as a list of `n` empty lists, where `n` is still greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
