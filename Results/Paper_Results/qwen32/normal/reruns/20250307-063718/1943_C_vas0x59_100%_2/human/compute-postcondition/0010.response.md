Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v`, the list at index `v` contains `u` twice, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from the new input.**

In simpler terms, the list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The variable `u` is now the first integer from the new input minus 1, while `v` retains its original value as the second integer from the new input.
