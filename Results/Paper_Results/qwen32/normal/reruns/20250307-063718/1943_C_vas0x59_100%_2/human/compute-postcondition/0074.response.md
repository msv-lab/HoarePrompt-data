Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. It is guaranteed that `u2vs` represents a valid tree with `n` vertices. The function returns `None`.**
