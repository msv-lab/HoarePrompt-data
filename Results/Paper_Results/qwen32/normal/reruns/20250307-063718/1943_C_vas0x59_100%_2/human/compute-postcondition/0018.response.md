The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Initially, the list at index `u` contains `v` twice. After appending `v`, the list at index `u` will contain `v` three times.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains `v` three times, the list at index `v` contains `u` three times, and all other lists are empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
