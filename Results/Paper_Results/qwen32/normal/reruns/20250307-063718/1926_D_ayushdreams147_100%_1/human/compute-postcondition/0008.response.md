Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least 1 element, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary that contains the first element of `a` as a key with its value decremented by 1, `num` is the first element of `a`, and the current value of `count[num]` is 0.**
