The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least 1 element, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num: 1}`, `num` is the first element of `a`, and `num` is not in `count` (prior to this update).**
