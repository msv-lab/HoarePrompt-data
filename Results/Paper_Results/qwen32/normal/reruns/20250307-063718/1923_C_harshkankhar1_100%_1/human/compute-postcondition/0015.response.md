The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state of these variables is not specified, but after the code executes, `x` and `y` will hold the values read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the integers from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
