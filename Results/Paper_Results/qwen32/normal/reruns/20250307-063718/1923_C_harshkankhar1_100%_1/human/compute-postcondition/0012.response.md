Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, and the loop has completed all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums based on the values in list `a`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` will be the sum of `x` values from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, where `x` is determined to be 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
