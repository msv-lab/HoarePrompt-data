The code snippet provided updates the value of `b[i]` based on the value of `a[i]`. Specifically, `x` is determined to be 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise. Then `b[i]` is updated to be the sum of `b[i-1]` and `x`.

Given the initial state, the value of `b[i]` is updated as per the described logic. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the queries `l_i` and `r_i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet. The list `a` and its cumulative sum `b` are the only variables that are directly impacted.

Since `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise, and `b[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `i`, the value of `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i] > 1`, and `b[i-1] + 2` otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i]` is updated to `b[i - 1] + x`**.
