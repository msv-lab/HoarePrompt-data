You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, and the loop has completed all iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then processes `q` queries, each defined by two integers `x` and `y`. For each query, it prints 'YES' if the sum of the elements in the subarray from index `x` to `y` (inclusive) is greater than or equal to the number of elements in that subarray that are greater than 1, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly check the condition that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray.

Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Condition 1**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the subarray `a` is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray `b`. However, it does not ensure that the sum of `a` is exactly equal to the sum of `b` because it only checks if the sum of `a` is less than the sum of `b` and not equal.

2. **Condition 2**: The program does not ensure that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray. The array `b` is constructed such that `b_i` is either 1 or 2, but the program does not check that `a_i` is different from `b_i` for each index.

3. **Condition 3**: The program ensures that `b_i > 0` for every index `i` by setting `b_i` to 1 or 2.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
Input:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The sum of the subarray is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- The program constructs `b` such that `b = [0, 2, 2, 2]` (since all elements in `a` are greater than 1, `b_i` is set to 2 for each `i`).
- The sum of `b` for the subarray is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
- Although the sums are equal, the program does not check if `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`.
- Since `a[1] = 1` and `b[1] = 2` (which are different), and `a[2] = 2` and `b[2] = 2` (which are the same), the subarray is not "good".

However, the program will output `YES` for this input because it only checks if the sum of `a` is less than the sum of `b` and not equal, which is not sufficient.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not fully check the conditions specified in the problem description.
