Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `c` consists of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is between 1 and 10^9. For each query, it receives two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the array `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in the given information.**
