Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**

Natural language: The variable `b` has been created and initialized as a list of `n + 1` integers, all set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
