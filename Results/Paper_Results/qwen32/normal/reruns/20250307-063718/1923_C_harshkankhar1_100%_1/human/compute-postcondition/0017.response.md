The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since `_` does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the fact that the loop counter will have been incremented implicitly.

Given that the loop runs `q` times, and the loop variable `_` is not used, we do not need to adjust any of the variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, or the printed output. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the integers from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, and 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` else 'YES' is printed.**
