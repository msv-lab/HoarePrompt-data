The given code snippet assigns a value to the variable `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, `x` is assigned the value 2. This operation does not affect any other variables except `x`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Only `x` is updated according to the condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.
