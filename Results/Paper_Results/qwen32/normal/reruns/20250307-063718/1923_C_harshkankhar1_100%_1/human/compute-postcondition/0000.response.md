The code snippet reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are integers within specific ranges, and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The array `c` and the queries `l_i` and `r_i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
