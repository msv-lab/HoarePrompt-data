The code snippet provided updates the list `b` based on the value of `x`, which is determined by the elements in list `a`. Specifically, `b[i]` is updated to be the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x`.

Given the initial state, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers all initialized to 0. The value of `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2. The code snippet provided updates `b[i]` based on the value of `x`.

Since `b[0]` is already initialized to 0, the update starts from `b[1]` and goes up to `b[n]`. Each `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.**
