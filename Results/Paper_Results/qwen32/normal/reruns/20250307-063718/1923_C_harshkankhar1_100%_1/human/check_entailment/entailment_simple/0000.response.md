### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` can be transformed into another array `b[l_i:r_i]` such that:
1. The sum of elements in `c[l_i:r_i]` equals the sum of elements in `b[l_i:r_i]`.
2. Each element in `c[l_i:r_i]` is not equal to the corresponding element in `b[l_i:r_i]`.
3. Each element in `b[l_i:r_i]` is greater than 0.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the input values for `n` and `q`.
2. Creating an array `a` which is a prefix sum array of the input array `c` with a leading zero.
3. Creating an array `b` which is a prefix sum array of an array where each element is either 1 or 2 based on whether the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1 or not.
4. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[l_i:r_i]`. If it is, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[l_i:r_i]`, the subarray is not good. This is not necessarily true. The key is to ensure that we can construct an array `b` such that all elements in `b` are greater than 0, different from `c`, and the sums are equal.

For example, consider the subarray `[1, 2]`. The sum is `3`. The program would create a corresponding `b` subarray `[2, 1]` (since `1` becomes `2` and `2` becomes `1`), which also sums to `3` and all elements are different and greater than 0. However, the program would incorrectly print "NO" because the sum of `c` subarray is not less than the sum of `b` subarray.

The correct approach should involve checking if we can construct such a `b` array by ensuring that we can decrement elements in `c` that are greater than 1 and increment elements that are 1, while maintaining the sum.
