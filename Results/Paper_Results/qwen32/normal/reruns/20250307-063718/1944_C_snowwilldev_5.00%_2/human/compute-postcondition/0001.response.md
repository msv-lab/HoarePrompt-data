The code snippet assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `N`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, which is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the new value of `N` as an integer input, and `t` will retain its original condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an input integer.**
