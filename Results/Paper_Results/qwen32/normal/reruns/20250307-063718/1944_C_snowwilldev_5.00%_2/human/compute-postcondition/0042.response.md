The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the array `a` within the dictionary `cnt`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. This means `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.

The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1. Therefore, the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` is updated. The values of `i` and `N` remain unchanged, and the condition that `N` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
