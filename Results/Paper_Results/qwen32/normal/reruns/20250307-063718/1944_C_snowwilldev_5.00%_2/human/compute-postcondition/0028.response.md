Postcondition: **`t` is either 1 or 3; `N` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is 5. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is set to 3. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.**
