Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 0. `N` is greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `tc` is incremented by 1.**
