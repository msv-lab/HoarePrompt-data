Postcondition: **`t` is either 1 or 2; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is 4. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[4] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cnt[4]` is 1, then `t` is set to 2. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.**
