Output State: **`t` is either 2 or 3; `N` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1. If `t` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If `t` was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
