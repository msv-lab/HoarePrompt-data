To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial Values**:
   - `t` is either 1 or 2.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values, where each element in the list `a` has been counted by the number of times it appears in `a`.
   - `i` is set to 4.

2. **Condition for `t`**:
   - If `cnt[4]` is 1, then `t` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

3. **The `print(i)` Statement**:
   - The statement `print(i)` will print the value of the variable `i`.

From the initial state, we know that the value of `i` is explicitly set to 4. The value of `i` does not change based on any condition or calculation given in the initial state. The variable `t` is dependent on the value of `cnt[4]`, but this does not affect the value of `i`.

Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 4.

Output: **4**
