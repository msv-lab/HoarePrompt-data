The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` will now hold the newly input integers, replacing its previous value.

Variables `t`, `N`, `cnt`, `i`, and `tc` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is the defaultdict with counts of elements in the previous list `a`, `i` is the value at which the loop breaks, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
