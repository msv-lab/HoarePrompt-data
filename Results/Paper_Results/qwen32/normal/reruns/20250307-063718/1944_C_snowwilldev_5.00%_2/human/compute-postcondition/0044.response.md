The value of `t` is changed to 0 by the given code. The other variables (`N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `tc`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`, `i` is `N - 1`, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
