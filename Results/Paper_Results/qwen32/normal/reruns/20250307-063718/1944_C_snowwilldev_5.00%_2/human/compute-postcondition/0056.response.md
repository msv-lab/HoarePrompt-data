To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is set to 2 if `cnt[i]` was equal to 1 before the if statement; otherwise, `t` remains 1.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the newly input line.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `tc` is incremented by 1.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 0.
   - The print statement is `print(i)`, so we need to determine the value of `i` when this statement is executed.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 and there is no information suggesting that `i` is modified before the print statement, `i` remains 0.

4. **Output Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
