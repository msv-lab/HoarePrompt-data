Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **N**: It is given that `N` is greater than 0.
2. **cnt[i]**: This is an element in a list `cnt`. The behavior of `t` depends on the value of `cnt[i]`.
3. **t**: This variable is incremented by 1 if `cnt[i]` equals 1. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **Current state of `t`**: It is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the context suggests that `i` is an index used to access elements in the list `cnt`.
- Since `i` is not provided with an explicit value, we can only say that `i` is an index that is being used in the context of the list `cnt`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(i)` statement will be the value of `i`, which is an index used to access elements in the list `cnt`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we know that `i` is an index that satisfies the conditions described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is an index used to access elements in the list cnt)**
