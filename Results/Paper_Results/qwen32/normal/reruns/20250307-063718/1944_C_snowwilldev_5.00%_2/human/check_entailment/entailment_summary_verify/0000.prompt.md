You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then outputs the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is zero or there are at least two unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why it might fail in certain scenarios.

The program is trying to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of both players. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Game Play:**
   - The code simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then tries to determine the MEX based on certain conditions. However, it does not simulate the actual turns of Alice and Bob, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
   
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The code checks if a number appears only once or not at all and then breaks the loop to print the MEX. This does not correctly simulate the game and does not ensure that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal moves of both players.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice will pick 0, then Bob picks 1, then Alice picks 2, then Bob picks 3, and finally Alice picks 4. The array `c` will be `[0, 2, 4]` and the MEX of this array is 1.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Program's Output:**
- The program will count the occurrences of each number and find that all numbers from 0 to 4 appear exactly once. It will then print 0, which is incorrect because the MEX of `[0, 2, 4]` is 1, not 0.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob and does not correctly calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game has been played optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
