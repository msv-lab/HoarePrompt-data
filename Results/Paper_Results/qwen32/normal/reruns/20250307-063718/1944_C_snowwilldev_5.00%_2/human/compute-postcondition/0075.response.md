The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to the fourth element of the list `a`. Since `cnt` is a defaultdict with all keys initially mapped to 2, the value associated with `a[3]` will be incremented from 2 to 3.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `N` must be greater than 3, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with `a[i]` mapped to 3 for `i=3` and 2 for other keys, `i` is 3, `tc` is 1**.
