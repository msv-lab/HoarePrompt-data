The provided code snippet resets the `cnt` variable to a new `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, which means all keys will have a default integer value of 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `a`, `i`, or `tc`.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements initialized to 0, `i` is the value at which the loop breaks, `tc` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the `cnt` dictionary is reset to be empty with integer defaults, while all other variables retain their previous values.
