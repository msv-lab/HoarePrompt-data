The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
