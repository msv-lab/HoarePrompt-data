To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is set to 1 if `cnt[i]` was 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
- `N` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values, where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`.
- The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0.

### Analysis:
- Since `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0, we can infer that if `t` is greater than or equal to 2, it means that `cnt[i]` was not equal to 1 for the current `i`. If `t` is 0, it means `cnt[i]` was 0 for the current `i`.
- However, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It is implied that `i` is some index or value that has been used to check the condition for `cnt[i]`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` from the provided information. However, we can state that `i` is some index or value that has been used to check the condition for `cnt[i]`.

### Output:
Since we cannot determine the exact value of `i`, we describe it in terms of the context provided.

Output: **i (where i is an index or value used to check the condition for cnt[i])**
