Output State: **`t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
