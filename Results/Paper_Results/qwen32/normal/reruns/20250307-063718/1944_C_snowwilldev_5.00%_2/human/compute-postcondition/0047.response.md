Output State: **`t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`, `i` is `N - 1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and `cnt[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
