To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations described.

### Initial State:
- `N` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - The problem does not specify the initial value of `i`. However, it states that `i` is incremented by 1. This implies that `i` must have had some value before this increment operation. Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. After the increment, `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.

2. **Condition involving `cnt[i]`**:
   - The condition checks if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. If true, `t` is incremented by 1. However, this condition does not affect the value of `i` directly.
   - Since we are not given the initial values of `cnt` or `t`, we can't determine the exact value of `t` or whether the condition was met. But this does not impact the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `i` that will be printed is `i_initial + 1`.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is the value of i_initial + 1)**

However, since `i_initial` is not specified, we can't provide a specific numerical value. The most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **i (where i is incremented by 1 from its initial value)**
