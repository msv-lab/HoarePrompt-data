The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `a[i]` refers to the next element in the list `a` compared to the previous state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is either 1 or 2
- `N` must be greater than `i`
- `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements incremented by 1 for the element `a[i]`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `tc` is incremented by 1

After executing `cnt[a[i]] += 1`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` will increase by 1. The values of `t`, `N`, `a`, `i`, and `tc` remain unchanged except for `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` must be greater than `i`, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements incremented by 1 for the element `a[i]` (specifically, the count of `a[i]` is now one more than before), `i` is incremented by 1, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
