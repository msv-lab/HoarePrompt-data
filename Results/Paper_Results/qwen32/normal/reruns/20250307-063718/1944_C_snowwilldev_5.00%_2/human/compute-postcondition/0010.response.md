Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt` dictionary will have the count of each unique integer in the list `a` as its value, corresponding to the integer as the key. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged, and `a` remains the same list of integers provided as input.
