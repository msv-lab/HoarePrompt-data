Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is either 1 or 3.
- `N` is greater than 5.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values, where each key in `cnt` corresponds to an element in the list `a`, and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `a`.
- `i` is set to 5.
- If `cnt[i]` (i.e., the count of the integer 5 in the list `a`) is equal to 1, then `t` is set to 3. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the value of `i`.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 5.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` is explicitly given as 5, and the print statement will output this value.

Output: **5**
