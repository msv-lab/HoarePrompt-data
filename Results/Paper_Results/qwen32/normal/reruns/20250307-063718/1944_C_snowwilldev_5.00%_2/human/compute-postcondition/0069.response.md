The code snippet reinitializes `cnt` as a `defaultdict(int)`, which means it will now be an empty dictionary that returns `0` for any key that does not exist. This reinitialization resets `cnt` to a new state, discarding any previous counts.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with no elements, `i` is the index where `t` reached 2, `tc` is 1**.

In simpler terms, the variable `cnt` is now an empty `defaultdict`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
