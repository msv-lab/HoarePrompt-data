The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. The other variables, `t`, `N`, `a`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of `a[i]` has been incremented by 1, `i` is `i+1`.**
