The value of `t` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `t` was either 0 or 1. Therefore, after the increment, `t` will be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables (`N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is 4**.
