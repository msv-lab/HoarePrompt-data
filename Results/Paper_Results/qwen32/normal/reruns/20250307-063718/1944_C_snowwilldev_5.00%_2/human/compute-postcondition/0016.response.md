Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` was 1, otherwise `t` remains 0. `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0.**
