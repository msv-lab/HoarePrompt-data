Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` was 1, otherwise `t` remains 0; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next statements.**
