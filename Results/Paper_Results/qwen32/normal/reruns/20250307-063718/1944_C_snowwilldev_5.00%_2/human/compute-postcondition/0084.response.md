The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `N`, `cnt[i]`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
