The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. This means the value associated with the key `a[i]` in `cnt` will be increased by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0 for any new key), so if `a[i]` does not exist in `cnt` before this operation, it will be added with a value of 1. Other variables (`t`, `N`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of `a[i]` has been incremented by 1.**
