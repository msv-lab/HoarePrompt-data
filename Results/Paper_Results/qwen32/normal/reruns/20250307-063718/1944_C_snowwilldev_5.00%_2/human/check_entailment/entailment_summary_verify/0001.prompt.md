You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then outputs the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is zero or there are at least two unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and Alice appends her chosen elements to `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` such that the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob will try to add elements to `a` (which are effectively removed from `c` in terms of MEX calculation) such that the MEX is minimized.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - For example, if `c` contains `[0, 1, 2]`, the MEX is `3` because `0`, `1`, and `2` are present, but `3` is not.

4. **Key Insight:**
   - The MEX of `c` is determined by the smallest integer that is not included in `c` after all elements have been processed.
   - If there is at least one unique element in `a` (i.e., an element that appears exactly once), Alice can ensure that this element will be in `c`, thereby increasing the MEX.
   - If there are at least two unique elements, Alice can ensure that two of these unique elements will be in `c`, which will further increase the MEX.
   - If all elements in `a` are repeated, the MEX will be `0` because no unique elements can be added to `c`.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks the count of each number.
   - If a number appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if a number does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current number `i` and breaks the loop.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest number that is either unique or missing in `a`, which corresponds to the MEX of `c` after optimal play.
   - The logic aligns with the optimal strategies described above:
     - If there are at least two unique elements, the MEX will be the smallest of these unique elements.
     - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be this unique element.
     - If all elements are repeated, the MEX will be `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly computes the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.
