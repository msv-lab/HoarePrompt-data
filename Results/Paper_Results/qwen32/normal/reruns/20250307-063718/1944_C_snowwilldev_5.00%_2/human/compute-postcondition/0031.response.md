Postcondition: **`t` is either 1 or 3; `N` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values where the count of each element in the list `a` has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is 5. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
