The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is incremented by 1**.
