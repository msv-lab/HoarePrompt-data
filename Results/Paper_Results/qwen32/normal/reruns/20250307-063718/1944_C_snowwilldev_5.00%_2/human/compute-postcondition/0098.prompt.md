Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with each element in `a` mapped to its count in `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than 0. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, the program does not break and continues executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt[i]` was equal to 1, then `t` is also incremented by 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is incremented by 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
