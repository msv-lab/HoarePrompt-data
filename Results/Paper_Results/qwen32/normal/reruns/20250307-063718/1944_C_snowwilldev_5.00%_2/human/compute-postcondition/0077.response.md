Output State: **`t` is 0, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with each element in `a` mapped to its count in `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been changed to 0. All other variables (`N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `tc`) retain their initial values.
