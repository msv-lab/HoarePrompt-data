The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a defaultdict with `a[i]` mapped to 1, which means `cnt[a[i]]` was initially 1. After executing the code, `cnt[a[i]]` will be 2.

Here are the values of the variables that remain unchanged: `t` is 2, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, and `tc` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with `a[i]` mapped to 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `tc` is 1.**
