The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with `int` as the default factory function. This means that any key accessed in `cnt` that does not exist will automatically be created with a default value of `0`. The variables `t`, `N`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default int values (0 for any new key).**
