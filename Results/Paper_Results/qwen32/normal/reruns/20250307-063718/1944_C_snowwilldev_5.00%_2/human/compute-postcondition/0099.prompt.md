Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop breaks when `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. `t` is either 1 or 2, `N` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers, `cnt` is the defaultdict with counts of elements in `a`, and `i` is the value at which the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 2, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`, `i` is the index where `t` reached 2, `tc` is incremented by the number of iterations until the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is the number of unique elements encountered with count 1, i is N-1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
