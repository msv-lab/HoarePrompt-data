The code snippet provided is `N = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, `tc`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 2, `N` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`, `i` is the index where `t` reached 2, `tc` is 1**.
