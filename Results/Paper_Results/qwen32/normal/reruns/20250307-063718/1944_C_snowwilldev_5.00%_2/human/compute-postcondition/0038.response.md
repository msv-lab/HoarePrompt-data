The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. The values of `t`, `N`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The only change is in the `cnt` dictionary, where the count of the specific element `a[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements incremented by 1 for the element `a[i]`, `i` is any value (will be set by the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1.**
