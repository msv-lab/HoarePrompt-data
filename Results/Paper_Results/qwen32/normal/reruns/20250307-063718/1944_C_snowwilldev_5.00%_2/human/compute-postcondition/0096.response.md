Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `N`, `i`, and `t` remain as per their conditions before the `break` statement. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `N`, `i`, or `t`.
