To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus only on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. The other variables (`cnt`, `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be directly adjusted here.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omit
```
And the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is greater than 0
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `cnt[i]` was equal to 1, then `t` is also incremented by 1
- If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the state of `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The state of `N` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change during iterations.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since we do not have specific values for `i` or `N`, we only express the relationship and the change in `i` as per the loop behavior.

Example Answer:
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
