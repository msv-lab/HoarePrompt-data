Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. The program attempts to determine the MEX by iterating through the counts of each number in the array `a`, but it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.
2. The logic for determining when to stop and print the MEX is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`, which is built by Alice's choices.
3. The program does not take into account the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob, which would affect the final composition of `c`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game based on the optimal strategies for both players. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in a:
            cnt[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                continue
            if cnt[i] % 2 == 0:
                cnt[i] = 0
            else:
                cnt[i] = 1
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                continue
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the optimal play by Alice and Bob and correctly computes the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
