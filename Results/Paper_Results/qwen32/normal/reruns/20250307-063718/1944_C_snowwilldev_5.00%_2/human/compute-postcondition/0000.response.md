To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided code snippet, the loop head is `for tc in range(int(input())):`. Therefore, the variables `tc` and the result of `int(input())` are the ones we need to consider.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `tc`**: This variable is the loop variable that will take on the values from 0 up to, but not including, the value of `int(input())`. Before the loop starts, `tc` is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized to 0 when the loop begins.

2. **`int(input())`**: This expression determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This means `t` is the number of test cases and it will be provided as input. Therefore, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `tc` is 0 (it will be initialized when the loop starts)**

Since `t` is the number of test cases and it must be provided as input, and `tc` is the loop variable that starts at 0, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is within the specified range and `tc` will be initialized by the loop.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
