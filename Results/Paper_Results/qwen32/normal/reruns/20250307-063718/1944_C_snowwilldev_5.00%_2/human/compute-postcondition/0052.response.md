Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` was equal to 1 before the if statement, otherwise `t` remains 0; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is the list of integers from the newly input line; `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`; `i` is `N - 1`; `tc` is incremented by 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
