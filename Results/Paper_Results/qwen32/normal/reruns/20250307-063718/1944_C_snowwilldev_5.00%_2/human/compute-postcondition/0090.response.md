Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt[i]` was equal to 1, then `t` is also incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `N`, `i`, and `t` remain as per their initial state conditions, but the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
