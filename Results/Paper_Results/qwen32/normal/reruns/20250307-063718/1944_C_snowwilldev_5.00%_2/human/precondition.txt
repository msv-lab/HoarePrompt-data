t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the second element is a list a of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of all n across the test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
