To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` is set to 3 if `cnt[i]` was equal to 1 before the if statement.
   - Otherwise, `t` is set to 2.
   - Since `i` is 1, `t` is determined by the value of `cnt[1]` before the if statement.

2. **Variable `N`:**
   - `N` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value doesn't affect the output.

3. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of integers from the newly input line.
   - The exact values in `a` are not specified, but they are used to populate `cnt`.

4. **Variable `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with counts of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears in `a`.
   - The exact counts are not specified, but we know that `cnt[i]` (where `i` is 1) is relevant for determining `t`.

5. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - This is a fixed value and is directly used in the print statement.

6. **Variable `tc`:**
   - `tc` is incremented by 1.
   - This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value doesn't affect the output.

7. **Condition to Break Out of Loop:**
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`.
   - Since `i` is 1, this condition is based on the value of `cnt[1]` and `t`.

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

- `i` is explicitly set to 1 before the print statement is executed.
- The value of `i` does not change between its assignment and the print statement.

### Conclusion

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 1 and does not change, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
