The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**
