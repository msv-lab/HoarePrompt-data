Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**
