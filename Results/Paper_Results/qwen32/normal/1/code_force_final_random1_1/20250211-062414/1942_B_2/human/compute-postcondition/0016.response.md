Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and `res[len(ar) - 2]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
mex = mex - ar[i]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, the code modifies `mex` by subtracting `ar[len(ar) - 2]` from it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and `res[len(ar) - 2]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the same input integer, `ar` remains the same list of integers, `res` remains the same list except that its last two elements are now calculated using the updated `mex`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.
