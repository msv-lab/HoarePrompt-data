Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[1]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `res[1]` is updated to `mex - ar[1]`. The value of `mex` may or may not be updated depending on whether `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
