To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element. For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, it performs the following operations:
1. It sets `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
2. It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

Initially, `mex` is set to `n`. As the loop progresses, `mex` gets updated based on the condition provided.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:
- In the first iteration (`i = len(ar) - 1`), `res[len(ar) - 1]` is set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- In the second iteration (`i = len(ar) - 2`), `res[len(ar) - 2]` is set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. If `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- This process continues until the first element of `ar` is processed.

After all iterations, `res` will contain the values `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, where `mex` is updated as described.

The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**

In simpler terms, `res` will contain the differences between the current `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that was not used in these calculations.
