Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `i` is 0. If `mex > mex - ar[0]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[0]` and `res[0]` is set to the new `mex` value. `res[1]` remains `mex - ar[1]` with the original `mex`. Otherwise, `mex` and `res` remain unchanged.**
