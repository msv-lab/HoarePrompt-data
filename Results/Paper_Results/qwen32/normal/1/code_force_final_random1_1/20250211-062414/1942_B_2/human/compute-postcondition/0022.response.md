The code snippet provided updates the `ar` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting those components to integers, and storing them in a list. This means the `ar` list will now contain the integers provided in the input.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ar`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**
