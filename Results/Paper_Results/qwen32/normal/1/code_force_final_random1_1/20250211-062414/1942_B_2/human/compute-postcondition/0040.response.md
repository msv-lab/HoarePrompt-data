In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the number of times specified by the input integer `t`. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and `range(int(input()))`, meaning that the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation or the program state directly. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `t`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`**.

However, since `t` needs to be adjusted specifically for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`**

Simplifying it, we get:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`**, with `t` decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
