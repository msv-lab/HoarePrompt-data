The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is `n`, and `ar` is a list of integers. After the assignment, `res[i]` will hold the value `n - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n`**.
