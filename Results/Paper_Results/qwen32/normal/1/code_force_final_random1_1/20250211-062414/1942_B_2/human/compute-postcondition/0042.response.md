The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `res`, or `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.**
