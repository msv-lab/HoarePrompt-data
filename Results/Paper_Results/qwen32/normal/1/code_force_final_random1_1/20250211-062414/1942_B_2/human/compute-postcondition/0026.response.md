The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is `n` and `ar` is a list of integers. After executing the code, the value of `res[i]` will be `n - ar[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, and `mex` is `n`**.
