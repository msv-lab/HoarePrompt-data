To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to verify whether it constructs a valid permutation \( p \) for each test case based on the array \( a \).

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX initially.
   - It creates a result array `res` of length `n` filled with `None`.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` (which corresponds to `a`) in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the values as a space-separated string.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program incorrectly assumes that `mex` should always be updated to the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`. This does not guarantee that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
- **No Check for Validity**: There is no check to ensure that the constructed permutation `res` contains unique elements from 0 to `n-1`.

### Correct Approach:
- **Forward Construction**: Instead of iterating backward, we should iterate forward and maintain a set of used numbers to calculate the MEX correctly.
- **Update MEX**: For each position `i`, find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers, then update the set with the calculated `p_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for a_i in ar:
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res.append(mex - a_i)
            used.add(mex - a_i)
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
