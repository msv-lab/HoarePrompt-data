Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
