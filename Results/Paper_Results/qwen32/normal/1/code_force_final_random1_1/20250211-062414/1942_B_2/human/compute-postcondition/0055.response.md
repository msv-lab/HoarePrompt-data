Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element
- `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`
- If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is decremented by 1
- If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1
- `i` is incremented by 1 to start the next iteration

Code Snippet:
```python
res[i] = mex - ar[i]
```

This line of code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. No other variables are modified in this single line of code.

Therefore, the only change is in the `res` list at index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value at `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
