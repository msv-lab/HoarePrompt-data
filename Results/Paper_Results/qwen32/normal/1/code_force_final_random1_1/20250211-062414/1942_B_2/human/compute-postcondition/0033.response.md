Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[1]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is 1.**
