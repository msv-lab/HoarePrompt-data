The code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex` remain unchanged, while `i` is decremented by 1. 

Given the initial state, `res[i]` was initially defined as `n - ar[i]`. After executing the code, `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1.**
