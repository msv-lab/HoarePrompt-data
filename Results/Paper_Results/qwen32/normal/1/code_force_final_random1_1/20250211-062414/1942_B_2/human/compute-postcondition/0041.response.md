The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.**
