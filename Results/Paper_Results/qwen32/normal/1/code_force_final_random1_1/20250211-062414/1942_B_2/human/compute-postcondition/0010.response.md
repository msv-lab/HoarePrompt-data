The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters (`len(ar) - 1`, `-1`, `-1`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from the last index of `ar` to the first index (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (since it goes down to -1 but stops before reaching it). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be set to the starting value of the range, which is `len(ar) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
