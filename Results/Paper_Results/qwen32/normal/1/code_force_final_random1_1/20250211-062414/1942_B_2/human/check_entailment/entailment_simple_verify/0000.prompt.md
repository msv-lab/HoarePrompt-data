You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n`, which is constructed based on a permutation `p` using the formula:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Given `a`, we need to reconstruct any valid permutation `p`.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through the array `a` from the end to the beginning and constructs the permutation `p` using the formula:
\[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{i-1}) - a_i \]

However, the implementation uses a variable `mex` which is initialized to `n` and decremented only when a smaller value is encountered. This approach does not guarantee that the `mex` is correctly calculated at each step because it does not account for the values already used in the permutation `p`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not maintain a set of used numbers to correctly compute the MEX at each step. Instead, it relies on a simple decrement operation which might not reflect the actual smallest unused number.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail for specific inputs where the sequence of `a` values requires a more precise calculation of MEX.

### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's consider the provided example inputs:

#### Example 1:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
This output seems correct based on the problem description.

#### Example 2:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
The program outputs:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```
This output also seems correct.

#### Example 3:
```
3
-2 1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
2 0 1
```
This output is correct as well.

### Constructing a Counterexample:
To demonstrate the potential issue, let's construct a counterexample where the program might fail:

#### Counterexample:
```
3
0 1 0
```
Expected Output:
```
0 1 2
```
Explanation:
- For `i=0`, `a[0] = 0`, so `p[0] = MEX([]) - 0 = 0`.
- For `i=1`, `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1] = MEX([0]) - 1 = 1`.
- For `i=2`, `a[2] = 0`, so `p[2] = MEX([0, 1]) - 0 = 2`.

The program might output something like:
```
0 1 0
```
which is incorrect because `0` is already used.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the counterexample, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX at each step, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
