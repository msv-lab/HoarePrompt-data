The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `ar[i]` is `ar[0]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[0]`.

The initial state specifies that `res[0]` is `mex - ar[0]`. Since `mex` is now updated to `mex - ar[0]`, `res[0]` effectively becomes `mex - ar[0] - ar[0]`, which simplifies to `mex - 2 * ar[0]`. However, since `res[0]` was initially defined as `mex - ar[0]`, and `mex` has been updated, `res[0]` remains as per its initial definition in terms of the new `mex` value.

The value of `res[1]` remains unchanged as it is defined as `mex - ar[1]` and `mex` has only affected `res[0]` directly.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[0]` is `mex - ar[0]` (with the new `mex` value) and `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`, `i` is 0, `mex` is `mex - ar[0]`**.
