The code updates the second element of list `a` (at index `i`) by adding the first element of list `x` (at index `i-1`) to the first element of list `a` (at index `i-1`). 

Given that initially:
- `a[0]` is 1000
- `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` are 0
- `x` is a list of `n` integers

After executing the line `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`:
- `a[1]` becomes `a[0] + x[0]` which is `1000 + x[0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1**.
