The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers, then outputs a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000, incremented by the corresponding elements in `x`.
