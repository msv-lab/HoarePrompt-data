The code snippet provided only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided through the input. None of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, `i`) are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer
- `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the new input
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is calculated based on the cumulative sum of elements in `x` starting from 1000
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing `n = int(input())`, only `n` changes to the new input integer. The other variables retain their original definitions and values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 1000`, `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`, `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and `i` is `n-1`**.
