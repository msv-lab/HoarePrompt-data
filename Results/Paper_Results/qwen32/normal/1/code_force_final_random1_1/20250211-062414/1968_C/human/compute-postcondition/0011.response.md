Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the nth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is n-1**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have its first element as 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) will be the sum of 1000 and all elements in the list `x` up to but not including `x[i]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
