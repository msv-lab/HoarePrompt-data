The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. This means the previous list stored in `x` is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the new list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 1000`, `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`, `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and `i` is `n-1`.**
