The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by `int(input())`, the state of `_` does not change during each iteration. The loop variable `_` is essentially a placeholder and does not affect the state of other variables in the program.

However, since the loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value allows for another iteration. But as per the problem statement, we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is just `_`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `_`.

Given that the loop variable `_` does not influence the state, the state of other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remains unchanged for the purpose of determining the loop's continuation based on the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the nth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is n-1**
