Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `x` is a list of `n` integers.
4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
   - `a[0]` is 1000.
   - Each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
5. `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Explanation:
- The list `a` is constructed such that the first element `a[0]` is 1000.
- For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it is calculated as the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the list `x`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. `a[0] = 1000`
2. `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`
3. `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
4. Continuing this pattern, `a[i] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

### Final List `a`:
- The list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]]`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output:
Given the construction of the list `a` and the print statement, the output will be the sequence of values calculated as described above.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where each term is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the respective elements from the list `x`).
