To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `x` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers constructed as follows:
     - The first element of `a` is 1000.
     - The second element of `a` is \(1000 + x[0]\).
     - The third element of `a` is \(1000 + x[0] + x[1]\).
     - ...
     - The \(n\)-th element of `a` is \(1000 + x[0] + x[1] + \ldots + x[n-2]\).
     - All subsequent elements (if any) are 0.
   - `i` is set to \(n-1\), but this variable is also not used in the provided code snippet.

2. **Construction of List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is initialized with the first element being 1000.
   - Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`, except for the last element which is just the cumulative sum up to \(x[n-2]\).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given these points, the output will be the elements of the list `a` constructed as described above.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the construction of `a`:
- Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
- The list `a` will be constructed as follows:
  - \(a[0] = 1000\)
  - \(a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010\)
  - \(a[2] = 1010 + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030\)
  - \(a[3] = 1030 + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060\)
- Since `n = 4`, there are no additional elements beyond the fourth one, so `a = [1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### General Case:
For a general list `x` of length `n`, the list `a` will be:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], \ldots, 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + \ldots + x[n-2]] \]

### Final Output:
Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where each term represents the cumulative sum as described)
