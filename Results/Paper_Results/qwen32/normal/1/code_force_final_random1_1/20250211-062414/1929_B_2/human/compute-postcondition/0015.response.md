To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output).
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 (This variable is also not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output).
- `n` and `k` are newly input integers (These are the only variables used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2. This means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement is the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Since `k` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the specific input. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an input integer)**
