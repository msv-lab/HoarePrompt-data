The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were previously described in the initial state) are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Here's the updated state:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (this part of the initial state does not affect the code snippet and remains unchanged).
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 (this part of the initial state does not affect the code snippet and remains unchanged).
- `n` and `k` are now the values read from the input, which means they replace their previous descriptions.

Since the values of `n` and `k` are now specifically set by the input, the condition "If `k` is equal to 4 times `n` minus 2, then the condition in the if statement is satisfied" needs to be re-evaluated with these new values.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are the values read from the input.**
