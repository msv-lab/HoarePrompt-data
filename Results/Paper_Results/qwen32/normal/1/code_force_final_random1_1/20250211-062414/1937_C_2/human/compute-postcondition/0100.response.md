To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`:** The problem states that `t` remains the same, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `t` is not used in the print statement, we do not need to consider its value for this specific output.

2. **Variable `n`:** It is mentioned that `n` must be greater than 1. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for it. Nevertheless, we know it is an integer greater than 1.

3. **Variable `k`:** `k` is described as the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was '<'. Since the exact responses are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`.

4. **Variable `best`:** It is stated that `best` is 0. Therefore, the value of `best` is explicitly known to be 0.

5. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state and is not mentioned in the context of the problem description. Given that it is not defined, we cannot determine its value. However, since it is included in the print statement, we will represent it as `i` without any specific value.

Given these points, the print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

The output will be a string starting with '?', followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k` again, and `i`. Since `best` is explicitly 0 and `k` and `i` are not specified, the output will reflect their respective states.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] [i] (where k is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 for which the response was '<', and i is an undefined variable)**
