To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: Remains the same (no specific value given).
   - `n`: Must be greater than 2 (specific value not given but it's known to be greater than 2).
   - `k`: This depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `n` + 1.
     - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
   - `i`: Set to the previous value of `n` + 2.
   - `best`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`.
   - `res`: User input (value not given).

2. **Code snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the values:**
   - The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
   - The second argument is `0`.
   - The third argument is `k`, which depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, `k` is the previous value of `n` + 1.
     - Otherwise, `k` is `1`.
   - The fourth argument is `0`.
   - The fifth argument is `i`, which is the previous value of `n` + 2.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `k` and `i` without knowing the previous value of `n` and the value of `res`. However, we can describe the values precisely based on the conditions provided.

- `k` will be either `1` or the previous value of `n` + 1, depending on whether `res` is `'<'`.
- `i` will be the previous value of `n` + 2.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is 1 if res is not '<', otherwise it is the previous value of n + 1, and i is the previous value of n + 2)**
