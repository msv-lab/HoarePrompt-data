The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since `i` is described as `i + 1` in the initial state, this means `k` will now hold the value of `i + 1`.

Given that `k` was initially either 1 or the value of `i` based on the condition of `res`, this assignment changes `k` to `i + 1` regardless of the initial condition.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i + 1`, `res` is the string input by the user, `i` is `i + 1`.**
