Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** Remains unchanged from its previous value, but its specific value is not provided.
2. **Variable `n`:** It is stated that `n` is greater than 1.
3. **Variable `k`:** This is the largest index `i` (ranging from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was '<'. The exact value of `k` depends on the responses received in the loop.
4. **Variable `best`:** This variable is set to `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it remains 0. The exact value of `best` depends on the responses received in the loop.
5. **Variable `i`:** This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

This statement will print the following values:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark.
- `k`: The largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was '<'.
- `best`: The value of `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise 0.
- `k`: Again, the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was '<'.
- `i`: The current value of `i` after being incremented by 1 in the loop.

### Explanation of Values:

- **`k`**: Since `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', it will be a specific integer value between 2 and `n-1` inclusive.
- **`best`**: This will either be the same as `k` if the last response was '<', or it will be 0 if the last response was not '<'.
- **`i`**: This will be the next index in the loop, which is `k + 1` if the loop is incrementing `i` by 1 each time.

### Final Output:

Given the above analysis, the output will be in the form:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i]**

Where `[k]` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was '<', `[best]` is either `[k]` or `0` depending on the last response, and `[i]` is the current value of `i` after being incremented by 1.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i] (where [k] is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was '<', [best] is either [k] or 0 depending on the last response, and [i] is the current value of i after being incremented by 1)**
