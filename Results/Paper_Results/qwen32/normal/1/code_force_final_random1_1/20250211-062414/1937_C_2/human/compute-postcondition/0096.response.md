Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2. If `res` equals '<', then `k` is set to the previous value of `i` (which is the previous value of `n` + 2), and `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'. Otherwise, `k` remains 1. `i` is the previous value of `n` + 2, and `res` is the new user input.**
