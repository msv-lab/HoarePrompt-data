Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` remains the same (value not specified).
2. `n` must be greater than 1 (value not specified but > 1).
3. `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since there is no specific information about responses, we assume `k` is not set yet or defaults to 0 if no such index exists.
4. `i` is 1.
5. `best` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes a literal question mark `'?'`.
- It then prints the value of `k`.
- Next, it prints the value of `best`.
- It prints the value of `k` again.
- Finally, it prints the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is not explicitly set but typically would be 0 if no index from 2 to `n-1` had a response of `'<'`.
- `best` is explicitly set to 0.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (the literal question mark)
- `k` (which is assumed to be 0 unless otherwise specified)
- `best` (which is 0)
- `k` (again, which is assumed to be 0)
- `i` (which is 1)

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 1**
