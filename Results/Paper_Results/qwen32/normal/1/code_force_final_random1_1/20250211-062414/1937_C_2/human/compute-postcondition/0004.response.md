To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a series of values separated by spaces.
- The values being printed are:
  - `'?'`: A literal string.
  - `0`: A literal integer.
  - `k`: The value of the variable `k`, which is explicitly given as 1.
  - `0`: Another literal integer.
  - `i`: The value of the variable `i`.

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` from the provided information.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we know the values of `'?'`, `0`, and `k`. The value of `i` remains unknown because it is not specified in the initial state.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 i (where i is an undefined variable)**
