The code snippet provided is simply `continue`. This statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, there is no loop structure in the given context, so the `continue` statement does not affect the flow or the values of any variables.

Since there are no changes to any of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the single element [-1], `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` (i.e., `total_points = cas_de_test[0][0] + cas_de_test[0][1] + cas_de_test[0][2]`), and `total_points` is odd.**
