To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the elements of the `cas_de_test` list, unpacking each tuple into `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple.
- The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `cas_de_test` during the first iteration.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple.
- The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` should correspond to the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

### State Adjustment:
- `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, but it does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple.
- `resultats` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**.

This ensures that the loop will execute with the first tuple's values being assigned to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
