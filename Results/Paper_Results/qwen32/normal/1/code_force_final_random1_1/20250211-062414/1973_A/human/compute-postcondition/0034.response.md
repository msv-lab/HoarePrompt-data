The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values outside of the loop context. Since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, `resultats`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) are altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, and `resultats` now includes an additional element `-1`.**
