### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Total Points Check**: 
   - The total points across all three players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
   - The code checks this condition with `if total_points % 2 != 0:` and appends `-1` to the results if it's not satisfied.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - Since each match contributes 2 points, the total number of matches can be calculated as `total_points // 2`.
   - The code calculates this and assigns it to `total_matchs`.

3. **Constraints on Total Matches**:
   - The maximum number of matches possible among three players is 3 (since each pair can play at most once).
   - Additionally, the score of the highest-scoring player (`p3`) cannot exceed the total number of matches.
   - The code checks these constraints with `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` and appends `-1` to the results if they're violated.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula attempts to account for the points contributed by wins and losses, leaving only the points from draws.
   - If the resulting `egalites` value is negative, it implies an inconsistency in the scores, so the code appends `-1` to the results.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is calculated as `egalites // 2` and appended to the results.

### Issues in the Code:
- The test case `(0, 2, 3)` in `cas_de_test` does not align with the problem constraints (`0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3`). However, since the problem description states that `p1 <= p2 <= p3` is guaranteed, we should assume that all input test cases adhere to this constraint.
- The formula for calculating `egalites` seems incorrect. Let's verify it with an example:
  - For the test case `(0, 1, 1)`, the calculation would be:
    - `total_points = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`
    - `total_matchs = 2 // 2 = 1`
    - `egalites = 2 - 2 * (1 - 1) - 2 * (1 - 0) = 2 - 0 - 2 = 0`
    - `egalites // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct number of draws should be `1`.
  - For the test case `(3, 4, 5)`, the calculation would be:
    - `total_points = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`
    - `total_matchs = 12 // 2 = 6`
    - `egalites = 12 - 2 * (5 - 4) - 2 * (5 - 3) = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6`
    - `egalites // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct number of draws should be `6`.
  - For the test case `(1, 1, 10)`, the calculation would be:
    - `total_points = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12`
    - `total_matchs = 12 // 2 = 6`
    - `egalites = 12 - 2 * (10 - 1) - 2 * (10 - 1) = 12 - 18 - 18 = -24`, which is invalid.

Given the above analysis, the formula for calculating `egalites` appears to be incorrect, leading to wrong results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
