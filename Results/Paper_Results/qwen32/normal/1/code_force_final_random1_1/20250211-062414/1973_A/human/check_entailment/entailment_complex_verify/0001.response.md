Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the original assessment.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points (`total_points`) as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - This is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid (each game awards a total of 2 points).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Validation of Total Matches**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs > 3`. This check is unnecessary and incorrect. There is no inherent limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players.
   - The program also checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This is a valid check because `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches played, as each match can contribute at most 2 points to `p3`.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is intended to isolate the points contributed by draws. Here's how it works:
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2`, which must come from wins.
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1`, which again must come from wins.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves only the points from draws.
   - The program then divides `egalites` by 2 to get the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

5. **Final Check for Draws**:
   - The program checks if `egalites` is less than 0. If it is, it means the calculated points from draws are invalid, and the program appends `-1`.
   - The program should also check if `egalites` is even because the number of draws must be an integer.

### Issues Found:
- The check `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed. As mentioned earlier, the maximum number of matches is not limited to 3.
- The logic for calculating draws is correct, but the implementation needs to ensure that the conditions leading to `-1` are properly handled. Specifically, `egalites` should be checked to ensure it is even.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the function without the unnecessary check and with the additional check for evenness:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0 or egalites % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains an unnecessary check that incorrectly limits the number of matches. Additionally, it does not check if `egalites` is even, which is necessary to ensure the number of draws is an integer. After removing the unnecessary check and adding the evenness check, the program should work as intended.

Given the issues identified, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the problems in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
