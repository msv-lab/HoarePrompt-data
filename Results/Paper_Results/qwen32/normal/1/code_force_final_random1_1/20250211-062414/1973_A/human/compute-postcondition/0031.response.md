To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `(p1, p2, p3)` from the list `cas_de_test`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples.
- `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- Additional conditions related to `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `p3`, and `egalites` have been applied to `resultats`.

Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `cas_de_test`, the only variables that need adjustment are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to reflect the next tuple in the list.

Let's assume the current iteration processed the second tuple in `cas_de_test`. The next iteration should process the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`**.
