The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the given variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` includes an additional element `-1`. `resultats` now includes an additional element `-1`.**
