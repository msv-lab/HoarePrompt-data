Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. 

There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid:
- \( n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
- \( n \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
- \( 2(n-2) \) diagonals that are not main diagonals but still count as diagonals.

### Key Observations

1. **Main Diagonals**: 
   - If we color the center cell of the grid, it will cover two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left).
   - For odd \( n \), the center cell is unique and covers two diagonals.
   - For even \( n \), there is no single center cell, but we can color two adjacent cells on the main diagonals to cover two diagonals each.

2. **Non-Main Diagonals**:
   - To cover additional diagonals, we need to color cells in other diagonals. Each additional diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell.

3. **Minimum Cells Needed**:
   - If \( k \leq 2 \), we can always cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring one or two cells.
   - If \( k > 2 \), we need to cover more diagonals. The optimal strategy is to cover as many diagonals as possible with the fewest cells. 
     - If \( k \) is even, we can cover \( k \) diagonals with \( k/2 \) cells.
     - If \( k \) is odd, we need \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \) cells.

4. **Special Case**:
   - When \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, we need to color \( n \) cells (one in each row or column).

### Solution Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
```

- **Case 1**: When \( k = 4n - 2 \), the code correctly prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because we need \( n \) cells to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, and \( n = (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 \).
- **Case 2**: When \( k \neq 4n - 2 \), the code correctly prints \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals, and we need to round up to ensure we cover at least \( k \) diagonals.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly handles both cases and calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid.

**Correctness: True**
