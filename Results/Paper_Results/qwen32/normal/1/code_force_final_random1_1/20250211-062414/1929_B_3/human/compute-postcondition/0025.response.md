To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the first integer from the line `s`.
   - `k` is the second integer from the line `s`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `n`: This variable holds the value of the first integer extracted from the line `s`.
   - `k`: This variable holds the value of the second integer extracted from the line `s`.

3. **Expression**:
   - The expression `2 * n` multiplies the value of `n` by 2.

Given the initial state, we know the value of `n` but not its specific numeric value since it depends on the content of the line `s`. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

**Explanation**:
- The `print(2 * n)` statement will output the result of multiplying the first integer `n` from the line `s` by 2.

Thus, the output will be twice the value of `n`.

**Output**:
Output: **2 * n (where n is the first integer from the line s)**
