To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each line of input and computes the output based on the given conditions. The loop reads multiple lines of input, where each line contains two integers, `n` and `k`. The output for each line is determined by the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 4`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The loop reads each line from the input file starting from the second line (skipping the first line). Each line is split into two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.

The loop continues until all lines of input are processed.

Given the initial state and the provided output states for the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue processing each subsequent line of input in the same manner.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact number of lines in the input, we assume that the loop processes all lines until there are no more lines to read.

### Final Output State
The final output state will be the sequence of outputs computed for each line of input according to the specified conditions. Since the exact input is not provided, we cannot compute the specific numerical outputs. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the process:

- The loop will read each line of input.
- For each line, it will compute and print the output based on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 4`.

Thus, the final output state is a series of printed values, one for each line of input, following the rules described above.

Output State: **A series of printed values, one for each line of input, where each value is determined by the conditions: `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 4 * n - 4`, `2 * n - 1` if `k == 4 * n - 3`, and `2 * n` if `k == 4 * n - 2`.**
