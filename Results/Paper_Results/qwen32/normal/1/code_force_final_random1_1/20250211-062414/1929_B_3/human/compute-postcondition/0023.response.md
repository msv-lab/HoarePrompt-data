To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first integer from the line `s`.
- `k` is the second integer from the line `s`.

### Code Analysis:
- The code uses the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `k / 2`, which means it divides `k` by 2 and then rounds the result up to the nearest integer.

### Explanation:
- Since `k` is the second integer from the line `s`, we do not have an explicit value for `k`. However, we know it is an integer.
- The division `k / 2` will yield a floating-point result.
- The `math.ceil()` function will then round this floating-point result up to the nearest whole number.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a few examples to illustrate how the output is determined:
1. If `k = 5`, then `k / 2 = 2.5`, and `math.ceil(2.5) = 3`.
2. If `k = 6`, then `k / 2 = 3.0`, and `math.ceil(3.0) = 3`.
3. If `k = 7`, then `k / 2 = 3.5`, and `math.ceil(3.5) = 4`.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output of the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer from the line s)**
