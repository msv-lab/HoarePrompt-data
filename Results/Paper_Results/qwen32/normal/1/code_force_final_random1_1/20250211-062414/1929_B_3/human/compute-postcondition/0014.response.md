The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `n` and `k` retain their input values. However, the code snippet overwrites the values of `n` and `k` with new inputs.

Thus, after executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be the newly input integers, while `_` being incremented by 1 and `t` remaining unchanged are not directly affected by this particular code snippet.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are newly input integers.**
