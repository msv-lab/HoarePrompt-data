Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is the number of elements in the first `m` elements of `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `cnt_b` has its counts decremented for each occurrence of elements from `a` that are in `b`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
