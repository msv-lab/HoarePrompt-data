The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is `curr + 1` (which means if `curr` was 1, it is now 2); `cnt_b` has the count of `a[i]` decreased by 2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
