### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique combined with frequency counting. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is set to `1000000`) to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `b` and stores these counts in `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - It first checks the initial window (from index `0` to `m-1`).
   - For each element in this initial window, if the element is in `b`, it decrements the corresponding count in `cnt_b` and increments a counter `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - If `curr` (number of matching elements in the current window) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from left to right.
   - For each new position of the window, it adjusts the counts in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` accordingly.
   - If the element going out of the window was in `b`, it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count becomes positive.
   - If the element coming into the window is in `b`, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - If `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k` after adjusting for the new window, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, it prints the count of good subarrays (`ans`).

6. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - Before starting the next test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero.

### Verification Against Example Input:

Let's verify the program against the first test case from the example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  7 4 2
  4 1 2 3 4 5 6
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Processing**:
  - Initial window `[4, 1, 2, 3]`: Matches `1, 2, 3` from `b` → `curr = 3` ≥ `k = 2` → `ans = 1`
  - Slide window to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`: Matches `1, 2, 3, 4` from `b` → `curr = 4` ≥ `k = 2` → `ans = 2`
  - Slide window to `[2, 3, 4, 5]`: Matches `2, 3, 4` from `b` → `curr = 3` ≥ `k = 2` → `ans = 3`
  - Slide window to `[3, 4, 5, 6]`: Matches `3, 4` from `b` → `curr = 2` ≥ `k = 2` → `ans = 4`

- **Output**:
  ```
  4
  ```

The program correctly identifies and counts the number of good subarrays for the given example input.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subarrays for each test case using the sliding window technique and frequency counting. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
