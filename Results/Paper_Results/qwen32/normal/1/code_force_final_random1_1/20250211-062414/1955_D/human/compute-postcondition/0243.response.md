The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in `b_values`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it relates to the elements in `b_values`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, which means that the current element `i` from `b_values` has been processed, and its count in `cnt_b` is reset or initialized to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `b_values` to process.

Since `i` takes on the value of each element in `b_values` during each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `b_values` after the one that was just processed. The state of `b_values` itself does not change; it still contains all its elements, but `i` moves to the next element.

Given that `b_values` must contain at least one element and we are moving to the next iteration, we can infer that `b_values` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute again. The exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration depends on the specific elements in `b_values`, but we know it will be the next element after the one just processed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements; `cnt_b[i]` is 0, where `i` is the next element in `b_values` after the one just processed.**
