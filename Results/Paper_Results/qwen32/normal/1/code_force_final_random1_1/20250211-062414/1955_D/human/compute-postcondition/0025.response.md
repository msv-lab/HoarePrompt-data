The code snippet provided increments the value of `curr` by 1. However, `curr` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value before the increment. We can only state that after the operation, `curr` will be whatever its previous value was plus one.

Other variables (`b_values`, `ans`, `m`, `i`, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1; `curr` is increased by 1.**
