Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `max_val` is 1000000; `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(m):
        cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
    b_values = set(b)
    ans = 0
    curr = 0
    for i in range(m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(n - m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                curr -= 1
        if a[i + m] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
    for i in b_values:
        cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `curr` is the final count of valid matches between the last window of `a` (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) and `b_values`, `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with all `cnt_b[i]` set to 0, `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts set to 0 for all elements in `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
