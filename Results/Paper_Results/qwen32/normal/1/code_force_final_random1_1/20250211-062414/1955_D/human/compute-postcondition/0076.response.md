To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **`b_values`**: This is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. Sets inherently do not allow duplicate values, so `b_values` will have only distinct elements from `b`.

2. **`ans`**: This variable keeps track of the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during a loop. It essentially counts how many times a certain condition (related to `curr` being >= `k`) was met throughout the execution of the loop.

3. **`curr`**: This variable represents the final count of valid matches between the last window of `a` (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) and `b_values`. In simpler terms, it is the count of elements in the last window of `a` that are also present in `b_values`.

4. **`cnt_b`**: This reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a`. It likely contains a dictionary or similar structure where keys are elements from `b` and values are their respective counts.

5. **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged throughout the process. `n` is presumably the length of list `a`, and `m` is the size of the window being considered in `a`.

Given this context, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and the results of the loop are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe what `ans` represents based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times curr was greater than or equal to k during the loop)**
