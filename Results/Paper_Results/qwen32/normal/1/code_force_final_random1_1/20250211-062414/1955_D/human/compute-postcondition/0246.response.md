The given code snippet sets `cnt_b[i]` to 0. Since `cnt_b[i]` was already 0 according to the initial state, this operation does not change its value. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements; `cnt_b[i]` is 0; `i` is the next element in `b_values`.**
