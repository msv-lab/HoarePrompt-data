The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in list `b` within the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is 5, the element at index 5 in list `b` is `b[5]`. Therefore, the count of `b[5]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 5, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[5]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 5.**
