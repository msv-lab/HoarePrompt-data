Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now one less than its previous value and is greater than or equal to 0; `n` must be greater than `m`; `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.**
