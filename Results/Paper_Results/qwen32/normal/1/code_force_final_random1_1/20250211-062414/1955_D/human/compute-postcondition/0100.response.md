The given code snippet decrements the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. This means the count associated with `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will be reduced by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.
- `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with `cnt_b[b[i]]` incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to the third integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `a[i]` is in `b_values`.

After executing the line `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will decrease by 1. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `cnt_b` has the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
