The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a[i]` is in `b_values`.

After executing the code, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1. No other variables are affected directly by this line of code.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**
