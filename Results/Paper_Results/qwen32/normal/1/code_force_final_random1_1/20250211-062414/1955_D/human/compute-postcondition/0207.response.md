Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. `curr` is the total number of elements in `a` that are in `b` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` after decrementing. `cnt_b` reflects the decrements for elements found in `a`. `n` must be greater than `m`. `k` are the values read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1.**
