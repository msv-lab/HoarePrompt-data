The code snippet simply increments the variable `ans` by 1. None of the other variables (`b_values`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, `cnt_b`, `curr`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is increased by 1.**
