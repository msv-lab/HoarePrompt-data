The given code snippet increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. This means that the value associated with the key `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` will increase by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0
- `k` is the third integer from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input

After executing the code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1`, the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.**
