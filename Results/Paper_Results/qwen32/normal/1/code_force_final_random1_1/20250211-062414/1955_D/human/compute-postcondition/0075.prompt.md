Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`; `cnt_b` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of elements from `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`; `n` is greater than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is set to 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `i` is `i + 1`. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative; counts of other elements in `cnt_b` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` and `curr` remain unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
