The given code snippet simply increments the value of `curr` by 1. None of the other variables (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values, including `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` which has already been decremented by 1 as per the initial state.
