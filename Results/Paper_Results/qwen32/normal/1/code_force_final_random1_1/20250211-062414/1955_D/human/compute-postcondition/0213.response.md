Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0 before the decrement. `n` must be greater than `m`. `k` are the values read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
