Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[4]]` is greater than 0, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged; `ans` is unchanged; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is 4; `cnt_b[a[4]]` is incremented by 1.**
