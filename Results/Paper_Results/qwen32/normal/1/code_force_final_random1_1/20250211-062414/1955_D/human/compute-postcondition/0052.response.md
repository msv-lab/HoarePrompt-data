Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`; `n` is greater than `m`.**
