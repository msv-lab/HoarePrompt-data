Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. `cnt_b[a[i_end + 1]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` are the values read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
