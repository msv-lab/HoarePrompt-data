The given code snippet only modifies the variable `curr` by incrementing its value by 1. None of the other variables (`b_values`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`) are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1; `curr` is increased by 1.**
