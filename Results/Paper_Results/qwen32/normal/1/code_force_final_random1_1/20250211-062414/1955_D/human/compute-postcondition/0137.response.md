Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is incremented by 1 and its value is now non-negative. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1. `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` is decreased by 1. The value of `ans` is recalculated based on the new value of `curr`. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
