Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated to 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is incremented by 1 and its value is now non-negative. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1. `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was not greater than 0, no changes are made to `curr`, `ans`, or `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`.**
