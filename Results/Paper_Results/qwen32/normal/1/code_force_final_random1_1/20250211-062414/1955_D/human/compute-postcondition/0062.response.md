The code snippet provided increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `ans` is now one more than its previous value. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is set to 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative; counts of other elements in `cnt_b` remain unchanged; if `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` and `curr` remain unchanged; `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**
