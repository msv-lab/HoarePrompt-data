Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, so if it was greater than 0, it is now `cnt_b[a[i + m]] - 1`. `cnt_b` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of elements from `b`. `n` must be greater than `m`.**
