The given code snippet increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is 4, the value `b[4]` will be used to update `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[4]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4.**
